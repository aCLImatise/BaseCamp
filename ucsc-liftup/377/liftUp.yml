help_text: "liftUp - change coordinates of .psl, .agp, .gap, .gl, .out, .align, .gff,\
  \ .gtf\n.bscore .tab .gdup .axt .chain .net, .gp, .genepred, .wab, .bed, .bed3,\
  \ or .bed8 files to\nparent coordinate system.\n\nusage:\n   liftUp [-type=.xxx]\
  \ destFile liftSpec how sourceFile(s)\nThe optional -type parameter tells what type\
  \ of files to lift\nIf omitted the type is inferred from the suffix of destFile\n\
  Type is one of the suffixes described above.\nDestFile will contain the merged and\
  \ lifted source files,\nwith the coordinates translated as per liftSpec.  LiftSpec\n\
  is tab-delimited with each line of the form:\n   offset oldName oldSize newName\
  \ newSize\nLiftSpec may optionally have a sixth column specifying + or - strand,\n\
  but strand is not supported for all input types.\nThe 'how' parameter controls what\
  \ the program will do with\nitems which are not in the liftSpec.  It must be one\
  \ of:\n   carry - Items not in liftSpec are carried to dest without translation\n\
  \   drop  - Items not in liftSpec are silently dropped from dest\n   warn  - Items\
  \ not in liftSpec are dropped.  A warning is issued\n   error - Items not in liftSpec\
  \ generate an error\nIf the destination is a .agp file then a 'large inserts' file\n\
  also needs to be included in the command line:\n   liftUp dest.agp liftSpec how\
  \ inserts sourceFile(s)\nThis file describes where large inserts due to heterochromitin\n\
  should be added. Use /dev/null and set -gapsize if there's not inserts file.\n\n\
  options:\n   -nohead  No header written for .psl files\n   -dots=N Output a dot\
  \ every N lines processed\n   -pslQ  Lift query (rather than target) side of psl\n\
  \   -axtQ  Lift query (rather than target) side of axt\n   -chainQ  Lift query (rather\
  \ than target) side of chain\n   -netQ  Lift query (rather than target) side of\
  \ net\n   -wabaQ  Lift query (rather than target) side of waba alignment\n   \t\
  (waba lifts only work with query side at this time)\n   -nosort Don't sort bed,\
  \ gff, or gdup files, to save memory\n   -gapsize change contig gapsize from default\n\
  \   -ignoreVersions - Ignore NCBI-style version number in sequence ids of input\
  \ files\n   -extGenePred lift extended genePred\n\n"
