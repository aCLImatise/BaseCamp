  \ diff_bams.pl -a 1.bam -b 2.bam\n\n    It is rare that BAM files can be compared\
  \ via MD5 due to various\n    processing information being incorporated into the\
  \ header such as\n    input/output paths. This program works around this by only\
  \ comparing\n    relevant information such as:\n\n      1. Same number and order\
  \ of @SQ headers.\n      2. All reads are in same order.\n\n    You are able to\
  \ compare a BAM vs it's corresponding CRAM\n\n      Required parameters:\n     \
  \   -bam_a    -a    The first BAM|CRAM file.\n        -bam_b    -b    The second\
  \ BAM|CRAM file.\n\n      Other:\n        -ref      -r    Required for CRAM, genome.fa\
  \ with co-located fai.\n        -count    -c    Count flag differences\n       \

  \      Run with '-m' for more detail\n\nOptions:\n    -bam_a  A valid readable BAM\
  \ file\n\n    -bam_b  A valid readable BAM file (different to bam_a)\n\n    -skipz\
  \  As reads with MAPQ zero can end up in multiple locations don't\n            consider\
  \ them as a mismatch.\n\n    -help   Print a brief help message and exits.\n\n \
