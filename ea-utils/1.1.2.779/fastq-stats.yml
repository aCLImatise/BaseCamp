help_text: "fastq-stats: invalid option -- '-'\n\nUsage: fastq-stats [options] <fastq-file>\n\
  \nVersion: 1.01 $Id$\n\nProduces lots of easily digested statistics for the files\
  \ listed\n\nOptions\n\n-c     cyclemax: max cycles for which following quality stats\
  \ are produced [35]\n-w INT window: max window size for generating duplicate read\
  \ statistics [2000000]\n-d     debug: prints out debug statements\n-D     don't\
  \ do duplicate read statistics\n-s INT number of top duplicate reads to display\n\
  -x FIL output fastx statistics (requires an output filename)\n-b FIL output base\
  \ breakdown by per phred quality at every cycle.\n       It sets cylemax to longest\
  \ read length\n-L FIL Output length counts \n\n\nThe following data are printed\
  \ to stdout:\n\n  reads\t\t\t: #reads in the fastq file\n  len \t              \
  \  : read length. mean and stdev are provided for variable read lengths\n  phred\t\
  \t\t: phred scale used\n  window-size\t\t: Number of reads used to generate duplicate\
  \ read statistics\n  cycle-max\t\t: Number of bases to assess for duplicity\n  dups\t\
  \t\t: Number of reads that are duplicates\n  %dup\t\t\t: Pct reads that are duplcate\n\
  \  unique-dup seq\t: Number sequences that are duplicated\n  min dup count\t\t:\
  \ Smallest duplicate tally for any duplicate sequence\n  dup seq <rank> <count>\
  \ <sequence> \n  \t\t\t: Lists top 10 most frequent duplicate reads along with count\
  \ mean and stdev\n  qual\t\t\t: Base Quality min, max and mean\n  %A,%T,%C,%G\t\t\
