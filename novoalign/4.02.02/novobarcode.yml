help_text: "\nUsage:\n    Novobarcode options\n\nOptions:\n -b tagfile          Specifies\
  \ the bar code tag file.\n -d folder           Sets folder name for demux'd reads.\
  \ Default ./\n -f file1 [file2]    Specifies read file(s). Two filenames if paired\
  \ end.\n -i filename         Specifies the qseq format file for the index tag reads.\n\
  \ -F format [option]  Specifies a read file format, refer to manual for full list\
  \ of options.\n                     For Fastq '_sequence.txt' files from Illumina\n\
  \                       CASAVA 1.3 to 1.7 use -F ILMFQ.\n                      \
  \ CASAVA 1.8 and later use -F ILM1.8\n                       Pre 1.3 use -F SLXFQ\n\
  \                     QSEQ & ILM1.8 files include reads that have been flagged as\
  \ low quality by the\n                     base caller. Specify how these are processed\
  \ with the following options:\n --ILQ_USE           Ignore QC flag and classify\
  \ the reads.\n --ILQ_SKIP          Write reads to NC folder\n --ILQ_QC         \
  \   ditto\n --QSEQ_OUT          Write qseq format output files if input is qseq.\
  \ Without this the output may be in fastq format.\n\n -l 9                Sets bar\
  \ code read length if different from tag length.\n -t 99               Specifies\
  \ a minimum tag alignment score difference between best tag and next best tag.\n\
  \n                     If difference is less than this reads are written to the\
  \ catch all file.\n                     Default is 30 * Distance/2\n -a [3' adapter\
  \ sequence]\n                     Enables adapter stripping from 3' end of reads\
  \ before checking for a 3' index tag.\n                     Default adapter sequence\
  \ is TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG.\n\n (c) 2008-2017 NovoCraft Technologies Sdn Bhd\n"
