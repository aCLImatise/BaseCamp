  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The tool compares\
  \ the results from two BUSCO runs (genome and proteome\n    mode) in order to pinpoint\
  \ the differences. It compares the BUSCOs\n    classification (complete,fragmented,\
  \ duplicated) of the 1st run (genome\n    mode) against the classification found\
  \ in the second run. It will report\n    the results in txt files, and extracts\
  \ the complete,fragmented and\n    duplicated annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run\
  \ in gff files. We add in the\n    gff an attribute specifying the cases e.g.\n\
  \    description=EOG090W00UK-complete2duplicated. Where EOG090W00UK is the\n   \
  \ BUSCO name/label/group investigated, and complete2duplicated the case we\n   \
  \ found (was complete in run1 and duplicated in run2). By loading these\n    gff\
  \ tracks in a web browser and helped by other tracks (e.g the genome\n    annotation/prediction)\
  \ can help to understand why the BUSCO have been\n    classified differently from\
  \ run1 to run2. In other term it allows to\n    catch potential problems in an annotation.\
  \ agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl\n    has been tested with results from BUSCO version\
  \ 3 and 4. /!\\ The tool\n    expects a BUSCO run in genome mode as input folder\
  \ 1 and a BUSCO run in\n    proteins mode as input folder 2. You can also decide\
  \ to provide twice\n    (--f1 --f2) the same BUSCO run in genome mode, the tool\
  \ will only\n    extract the annotation of the complete,fragmented and duplicated\n\
  \    annotated BUSCOs from the 1st run in gff.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl\
  \ --f1 <input busco folder1> --f2 <input busco folder2> [-o <output folder>]\n \
  \       agat_sp_compare_two_BUSCOs.pl --help\n\nOptions:\n    --f1    STRING: Input\
  \ busco folder1\n\n    --f2    STRING: Input busco folder2\n\n    -v or --verbose\n\
  \            Integer: For displaying extra information use -v 1. For\n         \
  \   activating the verbosity in the omniscient parser use -v 66.\n            (not\
  \ recommended)\n\n    -o or --output\n            STRING: Output folder.\n\n   \
