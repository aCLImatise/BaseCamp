help_text: "\nPROGRAM:        clean_genes\n\nDESCRIPTION:    Given a GFF describing\
  \ a set of genes and a corresponding \n                multiple alignment, output\
  \ a new GFF with only those\n                genes that meet certain \"cleanliness\"\
  \ criteria. The\n                coordinates in the GFF are assumed to correspond\
  \ to\n                the reference sequence in the alignment, which is\n      \
  \          assumed to be the first one listed.  Default behavior\n             \
  \   is simply to require that all annotated start/stop codons and\n            \
  \    splice sites are valid in the reference sequence (GT-AG, \n               \
  \ GC-AG, and AT-AC splice sites are allowed).  This can\n                be used\
  \ with an \"alignment\" consisting of a single\n                sequence to filter\
  \ out incorrect annotations.  Options\n                are available to impose additional\
  \ criteria as well,\n                mostly having to do with conservation across\

  \ <-> \"3'splice\"\n\n        In addition, splice sites in UTR can be separately\
  \ designated as\n        \"5'splice_utr\" and \"3'splice_utr\".  Errors in these\
  \ sites will be\n        given a different code in the log files, which can be useful\
  \ for\n        tracking purposes.\n\n        If evaluation is done at the level\
  \ of individual exons (see\n        --groupby), then splice sites are considered\
  \ independently\n        rather than in the context of introns.  As a result, the\
  \ exons flanking\n        a GT-AC or AT-AG intron might (misleadingly) be considered\
  \ \"clean\".\n\n        With --fshift and --nonsense, it is possible for entries\n\
  \        to pass through that have stop codons in the frame of the\n        *reference*\
  \ sequence, although they do not have any in their\n        own frame.  Use --clean-gaps\
  \ instead to guarantee that no stop\n        codons occur in any sequence in the\
  \ frame of the reference\n        sequence.\n"
