help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified October 14, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Counts the number of unique kmers in a file.\nGenerates a kmer frequency histogram\
  \ and genome size estimate (in peaks output),\nand prints a file containing all\
  \ kmers and their counts.\nSupports K=1 to infinity, though not all values are allowed.\n\
  SEE ALSO: bbnorm.sh/khist.sh, loglog.sh, and kmercountmulti.sh.\n\nUsage:   kmercountexact.sh\
  \ in=<file> khist=<file> peaks=<file>\n\nInput may be fasta or fastq, compressed\
  \ or uncompressed.\nOutput may be stdout or a file.  out, khist, and peaks are optional.\n\
  \n\nInput parameters:\nin=<file>           Primary input file.\nin2=<file>     \
  \     Second input file for paired reads.\namino=f             Run in amino acid\
  \ mode.\n\nOutput parameters:\nout=<file>          Print kmers and their counts.\
  \  This is produces a\n                    huge file, so skip it if you only need\
  \ the histogram.\nfastadump=t         Print kmers and counts as fasta versus 2-column\
  \ tsv.\nmincount=1          Only print kmers with at least this depth.\nreads=-1\
  \            Only process this number of reads, then quit (-1 means all).\ndumpthreads=-1\
  \      Use this number of threads for dumping kmers (-1 means auto).\n\nHashing\
  \ parameters:\nk=31                Kmer length (1-31 is fastest).\nprealloc=t  \
  \        Pre-allocate memory rather than dynamically growing; faster and more memory-efficient.\
  \  A float fraction (0-1) may be specified, default 1.\nprefilter=0         If set\
  \ to a positive integer, use a countmin sketch to ignore kmers with depth of that\
  \ value or lower.\nprehashes=2         Number of hashes for prefilter.\nprefiltersize=0.2\
  \   Fraction of memory to use for prefilter.\nminq=6              Ignore kmers containing\
  \ bases with quality below this. (TODO)\nminprob=0.0         Ignore kmers with overall\
  \ probability of correctness below this.\nthreads=X           Spawn X hashing threads\
  \ (default is number of logical processors).\nonepass=f           If true, prefilter\
  \ will be generated in same pass as kmer counts.  Much faster but counts will be\
  \ lower, by up to prefilter's depth limit.\nrcomp=t             Store and count\
  \ each kmer together and its reverse-complement.\n\nHistogram parameters:\nkhist=<file>\
  \        Print kmer frequency histogram.\nhistcolumns=2       2 columns: (depth,\
  \ count).  3 columns: (depth, rawCount, count).\nhistmax=100000      Maximum depth\
  \ to print in histogram output.\nhistheader=t        Set true to print a header\
  \ line.\nnzo=t               (nonzeroonly) Only print lines for depths with a nonzero\
  \ kmer count.\ngchist=f            Add an extra histogram column with the average\
  \ GC%.\n\nIntersection parameters:\nref=<file>          An input assembly of the\
  \ input reads.\nintersection=<file> Output file for a 2-D histogram of read and\
  \ ref kmer counts.\nrefmax=6            Maximum reference kmer depth to track; read\
  \ depth is controlled by 'histmax'.\n\nSmoothing parameters:\nsmoothkhist=f    \
  \   Smooth the output kmer histogram.\nsmoothpeaks=t       Smooth the kmer histogram\
  \ for peak-calling, but does not affect the output histogram.\nsmoothradius=1  \
  \    Initial radius of progressive smoothing function.\nmaxradius=10        Maximum\
  \ radius of progressive smoothing function.\nprogressivemult=2   Increment radius\
  \ each time depth increases by this factor.\nlogscale=t          Transform to log-scale\
  \ prior to peak-calling.\nlogwidth=0.1        The larger the number, the smoother.\n\
  \nPeak calling parameters:\npeaks=<file>        Write the peaks to this file.  Default\
  \ is stdout. \n                    Also contains the genome size estimate in bp.\n\
  minHeight=2         (h) Ignore peaks shorter than this.\nminVolume=5         (v)\
  \ Ignore peaks with less area than this.\nminWidth=3          (w) Ignore peaks narrower\
  \ than this.\nminPeak=2           (minp) Ignore peaks with an X-value below this.\n\
  maxPeak=BIG         (maxp) Ignore peaks with an X-value above this.\nmaxPeakCount=12\
  \     (maxpc) Print up to this many peaks (prioritizing height).\nploidy=-1    \
  \       Specify ploidy; otherwise it will be autodetected.\n\nSketch parameters\
  \ (for making a MinHashSketch):\nsketch=<file>       Write a minhash sketch to this\
  \ file.\nsketchlen=10000     Output the top 10000 kmers.  Only kmers with at least\
  \ mincount are included.\nsketchname=         Name of output sketch.\nsketchid=\
  \           taxID of output sketch.\n\nQuality parameters:\nqtrim=f            \
  \ Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.\n                    Values:\
  \ t (trim both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only), l (left end only).\n\
  trimq=4             Trim quality threshold.\nminavgquality=0     (maq) Reads with\
  \ average quality (before trimming) below this will be discarded.\n\nOverlap parameters\
  \ (for overlapping paired-end reads only):\nmerge=f             Attempt to merge\
  \ reads before counting kmers.\necco=f              Error correct via overlap, but\
  \ do not merge reads.   \n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx                This will set\
  \ Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                    -Xmx20g will\
  \ specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n                \
  \    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom               This flag\
  \ will cause the process to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory exception\
  \ occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\n"
