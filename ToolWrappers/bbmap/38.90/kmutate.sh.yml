help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified January 26, 2021\n\nDescription:\
  \  Given a reference, generates a kmer spectrum including a \nspecified number of\
  \ substitutions, insertions, and deletions.  The output is \nuseful for analyzing\
  \ barcodes or other short oligos, and filtering using\nBBDuk or Seal. Input may\
  \ be fasta or fastq, compressed or raw.\nSee also kcompress, kmercountexact, and\
  \ bbkmerset.\n\nUsage:  kmutate.sh in=<file> out=<file> k=<kmer length> edist=<edit\
  \ distance>\n\nExamples:\n\n        kmutate.sh in=x.fa out=y.fa k=31 edist=2\nThis\
  \ will generate all 31-mers in x.fa, along with all 31-mer mutants with\nan edit\
  \ distance of up to 2.  For example, 1 substitution, or 1 substitution\nplus 1 deletion,\
  \ or any other combination of subsitutions, insertions,\nand deletions that sum\
  \ to 0, 1, or 2.\n\n        kmutate.sh in=x.fa out=y.fa k=31 idist=1 ddist=3\nThis\
  \ will generate all 31-mers in x.fa, along with all 31-mer mutants allowing\nup\
  \ to 1 insertion and 3 deletions, but no substitutions.  For example,\n1 insertion\
  \ and 3 deletions is possible (edit distance 4), but 1 deletion and \n1 substitution\
  \ is not directly possible (though some equivalent mutants would\nstill be generated\
  \ because a deletion and subsequent insertion is equivalent \nto a substitution).\n\
  \nNote that deletion events have limitations; e.g., they cannot occur on input\n\
  sequences of length k because the resulting sequence is shorter than k.  As\na result,\
  \ running the program twice consecutively with edist=1 will not give\nthe same results\
  \ as running once with edist=2 since the intermediate file will\nbe only k-length\
  \ sequences.  However, running consecutively with sdist or\nidist would be equivalent\
  \ since they do not involve deletions.\n\nStandard parameters:\nin=<file>      \
  \ Primary input, or read 1 input.\nin2=<file>      Read 2 input if reads are in\
  \ two files.\nout=<file>      Primary output, or read 1 output.\noverwrite=t   \
  \  (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than\n               \
  \ overwrite an existing file.\n\nProcessing parameters:\nk=31            Kmer length;\
  \ 1-31.\nrcomp=t         Consider kmers equivalent to their reverse-complements.\n\
  \nEdit mode flags (used if edist>0):\nedist=0         Set the maximal edit distance\
  \ (0-3).\nsmax=99         (optional) Don't allow more than this many total substitutions.\n\
  dmax=99         (optional) Don't allow more than this many total deletions.\nimax=99\
  \         (optional) Don't allow more than this many total insertions.\n\nSDI mode\
  \ flags:\nsdist=0         Maximum substitutions allowed.\nidist=0         Maximum\
  \ insertions allowed.\nddist=0         Maximum deletions allowed (0-3).\nemax=99\
  \         (optional) Don't allow more than this many total edits.\n\n*** Note -\
  \ please use SDI mode flags OR Edit mode flag, not both. ***\n*** Both modes are\
  \ equivalent, they just have different defaults. ***\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx \
  \           This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n     \
  \           -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n           \
  \     specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom    \
  \       This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n         \
  \       exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
