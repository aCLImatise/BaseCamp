help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified January 28, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Merges files of SSU sequences to keep one per taxID.\nBy default, a consensus\
  \ is generated per TaxID, then the sequence\nbest matching that consensus is used:\n\
  First, all sequences per TaxID are aligned to a reference consensus.\nSecond, the\
  \ best-matching sequence is used as a seed, and all other\nsequences for that TaxID\
  \ are aligned to the seed to generate a new consensus.\nThird, in 'consensus' mode,\
  \ that consensus is simply output.\nIn 'best' mode (default), all sequences are\
  \ aligned again to the new consensus,\nand the best-matching is output.\n\nUsage:\
  \  mergeribo.sh in=<file,file> out=<file> 16S\n\nStandard parameters:\nin=<file,file>\
  \  Comma-delimited list of files.\nout=<file>      Output file.\nout2=<file>   \
  \  Read 2 output if reads are in two files.\noverwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to\
  \ force the program to abort rather than\n                overwrite an existing\
  \ file.\nshowspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display of processing speed.\n\
  ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression\n \
  \               level; lower compression is faster.\n\nProcessing parameters:\n\
  alt=<file>      Lower priority data.  Only used if there is no SSU associated\n\
  \                with the TaxID from the primary input.\nbest=t          Output\
  \ the best representative per taxID.\nconsensus=f     Output a consensus per taxID\
  \ instead of the best input\n                sequence.  Mutually exclusive with\
  \ best.\nfast=f          Output the best sequence based on alignment to global consensus\n\
  \                (the seed) rather than individual consensus.\nminid=0.62      Ignore\
  \ sequences with identity lower than this to the global\n                consensus.\n\
  maxns=-1        Ignore sequences with more than this many Ns, if non-negative.\n\
  minlen=1        Ignore sequences shorter than this.\nmaxlen=4000     Ignore sequences\
  \ longer than this.\n16S=t           Align to 16S consensus to pick the seed. Mutually\
  \ exclusive.\n18S=f           Align to 18S consensus to pick the seed. Mutually\
  \ exclusive.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage,\
  \ overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM,\
  \ and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85%\
  \ of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit\
  \ if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n\
  -da             Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
