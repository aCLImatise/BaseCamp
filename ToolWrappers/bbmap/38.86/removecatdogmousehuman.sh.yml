help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified September 17, 2018\nThis script\
  \ requires at least 52GB RAM.\nIt is designed for NERSC and uses hard-coded paths.\n\
  \nDescription:  Removes all reads that map to the cat, dog, mouse, or human genome\
  \ with at least 95% identity after quality trimming.\nRemoves approximately 98.6%\
  \ of human 2x150bp reads, with zero false-positives to non-animals.\nNOTE!  This\
  \ program uses hard-coded paths and will only run on Nersc systems.\n\nUsage:  removecatdogmousehuman.sh\
  \ in=<input file> outu=<clean output file>\n\nInput may be fasta or fastq, compressed\
  \ or uncompressed.\n\nParameters:\nthreads=auto        (t) Set number of threads\
  \ to use; default is number of logical processors.\noverwrite=t         (ow) Set\
  \ to false to force the program to abort rather than overwrite an existing file.\n\
  interleaved=auto    (int) If true, forces fastq input to be paired and interleaved.\n\
  trim=t              Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.\n  \
  \                  Values: t (trim both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only),\
  \ l (left end only).\nuntrim=t            Undo the trimming after mapping.\nminq=4\
  \              Trim quality threshold.\nziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest)\
  \ through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression is faster.\noutm=<file>\
  \         File to output the reads that mapped to human.\n\n***** All BBMap parameters\
  \ can be used; run bbmap.sh for more details. *****\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
