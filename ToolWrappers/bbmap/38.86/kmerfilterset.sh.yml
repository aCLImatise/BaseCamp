help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified October 24, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Generates a set of kmers such that every input sequence will\ncontain at least\
  \ one kmer in the set.  This is a greedy algorithm which\nretains the top X most\
  \ common kmers each pass, and removes the sequences\nmatching those kmers, so subsequent\
  \ passes are faster.\n\nThis will not generate an optimally small set but the output\
  \ will be\nquite small.  The file size may be further decreased with kcompress.sh.\n\
  \nUsage:  kmerfilterset.sh in=<input file> out=<output file> k=<integer>\n\nFile\
  \ parameters:\nin=<file>       Primary input.\nout=<file>      Primary output.\n\
  temp=<file>     Temporary file pattern (optional).  Must contain # symbol.\ninitial=<file>\
  \  Initial kmer set (optional).  This can be used to accelerate\n              \
  \  the process.\n\nProcessing parameters:\nk=31            Kmer length.\nrcomp=t\
  \         Consider forward and reverse-complement kmers identical.\nminkpp=1   \
  \     (minkmersperpass) Retain at least this many kmers per pass.\n            \
  \    Higher is faster but results in a larger set.\nmaxkpp=2        (maxkmersperpass)\
  \ Retain at most this many kmers per pass;\n                0 means unlimited.\n\
  mincount=1      Ignore kmers seen fewer than this many times in this pass.\nmaxpasses=3000\
  \  Don't run more than this many passes.\nmaxns=BIG       Ignore sequences with\
  \ more than this many Ns.\nminlen=0        Ignore sequences shorter than this.\n\
  \nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding\
  \ autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m\
  \ will\n                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n\
  -eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n \
  \               exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable\
  \ assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter\
  \ any problems.\n\n"
