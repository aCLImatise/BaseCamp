help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell and Jonathan Rood\nLast modified September\
  \ 15, 2015\n\nDedupe2 is identical to Dedupe except it supports hashing unlimited\
  \ kmer\nprefixes and suffixes per sequence.  Dedupe supports at most 2 of each,\n\
  but uses slightly more memory.  You can manually set the number of kmers to\nhash\
  \ per read with the numaffixmaps (nam) flag.  Dedupe will automatically\ncall Dedupe2\
  \ if necessary (if nam=3 or higher) so this script is no longer\nnecessary.\n\n\
  For documentation, please consult dedupe.sh; syntax is identical.\n\n"
