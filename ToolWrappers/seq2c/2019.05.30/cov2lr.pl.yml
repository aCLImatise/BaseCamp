help_text: "    Usage: /usr/local/bin/cov2lr.pl [-aH] [-c control] mapping_reads coverage.txt\n\
  \n    The /usr/local/bin/cov2lr.pl program will convert a coverage file to copy\
  \ number profile.\n\n    Arguments are:\n    mapping_reads: Required.  A file containing\
  \ # of mapped or sequenced reads for samples.  At least two columns.\n         \
  \          First is the sample name, 2nd is the number of mapped or sequenced reads.\n\
  \    coverage.txt:  The coverage output file from seq2cov.pl script.  Can also take\
  \ from standard in or more than\n                   one file.\n\n    Options are:\n\
  \n    -a Indicate this is amplicon or exon based calling.  By default, it will aggregate\
  \ at gene level.\n\n    -M Indicate to adjust the MAD when transforming the distribution.\
  \  Default: no, or just simple linear function.\n       If not sure, do not use\
