  \ this help message and exit\n  --compute-gene-psi=COMPUTE_GENE_PSI\n          \
  \              Compute Psi using for a given multi-isoform gene.\n             \
  \           Expects four arguments: the first is a gene ID or set\n            \
  \            of comma-separated (no spaces) gene IDs, the second is\n          \
  \              a GFF indexed file with the gene information, the\n             \
  \           third is a sorted and indexed BAM file with reads\n                \
  \        aligned to the gene, and the fourth is an output\n                    \
  \    directory.\n  --paired-end=PAIRED_END\n                        Run in paired-end\
  \ mode.  Takes a mean and standard\n                        deviation for the fragment\
  \ length distribution\n                        (assumed to have discretized normal\
  \ form.)\n  --compute-genes-from-file=COMPUTE_GENES_FROM_FILE\n                \
  \        Runs on a set of genes from a file. Takes as input:\n                 \
  \       (1) a two-column tab-delimited file, where column 1 is\n               \
  \         the event ID (ID field from GFF) and the second column\n             \
  \           is the path to the indexed GFF file for that event.\n              \
  \          MISO will run on all the events described in the file,\n            \
  \            (2) a sorted, indexed BAM file to run on, and (3) a\n             \
  \           directory to output results to.\n  --compare-samples=SAMPLES_TO_COMPARE\n\
  \                        Compute comparison statistics between the two given\n \
  \                       samples. Expects three directories: the first is\n     \
  \                   sample1's MISO output, the second is sample2's MISO\n      \
  \                  output, and the third is the directory where results\n      \
  \                  of the sample comparison will be outputted.\n  --comparison-labels=COMPARISON_LABELS\n\
  \                        Use these labels for the sample comparison made by\n  \
  \                      --compare-samples. Takes two arguments: the label for\n \
  \                       sample 1 and the label for sample 2, where sample 1\n  \
  \                      and sample 2 correspond to the order of samples given\n \
  \                       to --compare-samples.\n  --summarize-samples=SUMMARIZE_SAMPLES\n\
  \                        Compute summary statistics of the given set of\n      \
  \                  samples. Expects a directory with MISO output and a\n       \
  \                 directory to output summary file to.\n  --summary-label=SUMMARY_LABEL\n\
  \                        Label for MISO summary file. If not given, uses\n     \
  \                   basename of MISO output directory.\n  --use-cluster        \
  \ \n  --chunk-jobs=CHUNK_JOBS\n                        Size (in number of events)\
  \ of each job to chunk events\n                        file into. Only applies when\
  \ running on cluster.\n  --settings-filename=SETTINGS_FILENAME\n               \
  \         Filename specifying MISO settings.\n  --read-len=READ_LEN   \n  --overhang-len=OVERHANG_LEN\n\
  \  --event-type=EVENT_TYPE\n                        Event type of two-isoform events\
  \ (e.g. 'SE', 'RI',\n                        'A3SS', ...)\n  --use-compressed=USE_COMPRESSED\n\
  \                        Use compressed event IDs. Takes as input a\n          \
  \              genes_to_filenames.shelve file produced by the\n                \
  \        index_gff script.\n  --view-gene=VIEW_GENE\n                        View\
  \ the contents of a gene/event that has been\n                        indexed. Takes\
  \ as input an indexed (.pickle) filename.\n"
