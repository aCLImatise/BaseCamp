help_text: "NAME\n    fu-cat - concatenate FASTA or FASTQ files\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    \
  \  fu-cat [options] [FILE1 FILE2 FILE3...]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    This program parses\
  \ a list of FASTA/FASTQ and will concatenate them\n    ensuring consistent output.\
  \ Will rename duplicate sequence names. Will\n    try to autodetect the format of\
  \ all files before executing and decide\n    accordingly the output format (FASTA\
  \ if at least one of the files is\n    FASTA, otherwise FASTQ). If reading from\
  \ STDIN the first sequence is in\n    FASTQ format, will skip all the sequences\
  \ without a quality string.\n\n    If no files are provided the program will try\
  \ reading from STDIN,\n    otherwise add a '-' to the list of files to also read\
  \ from STDIN.\n\nPARAMETERS\n    *-s*, *--separator*\n        When a second sequence\
  \ with a name that was already printed is\n        found, the program will append\
  \ a progressive number, separated by\n        this string. Use `fu-rename` if you\
  \ need more options. [default:\n        \".\"]\n\n    *-f*, *--fasta*\n        Force\
  \ FASTA output\n\n    *-q*, *--fastq*\n        Force FASTQ output. Will not print\
  \ any sequence without quality\n        (they will be skipped)\n\n    *-u*, *--uppercase*\n\
  \        Will print the whole sequence in uppercase\n\n    *-w*, *--width* INT\n\
  \        Size of the FASTA lines. Specifing 0 will print the whole sequence\n  \
  \      in the same line (default: 0)\n\n    *--verbose*\n        Print more details\n\
  \n    *--help*\n        Display this help page\n\n    *--version*\n        Print\
  \ version and exit\n\nAUTHOR\n    Andrea Telatin <andrea@telatin.com>\n\nCOPYRIGHT\
