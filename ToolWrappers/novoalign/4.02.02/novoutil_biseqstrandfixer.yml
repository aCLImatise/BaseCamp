help_text: "\nUsage:\n\nnovoutil biseqstrandfixer < input.sam   > output.sam\n\nDescription:\n\
  \    Reads a Novoalign BiSeq SAM file from stdin and swaps read1/read2 flag on proper\
  \ pair\n    alignments that don't fit strand conserved BiSeq samples. This is useful\
  \ for sample preps\n    where 4 possible biseq alignments are possible and if using\
  \ variant caller such as BisSNP\n    that require strand preserved alignments. \n\
  \nOptions:\n    None, this just stdin to stdout\n\n"
