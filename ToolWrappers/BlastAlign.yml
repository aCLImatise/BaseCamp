command:
- BlastAlign
positional: []
named:
- !Flag
  description: <maximum percentage of gaps allowed in any one sequence in the final
    alignment> Optional but we find 0.5 the most useful; default = 95, i.e. only removing
    sequences with extremely short matches
  synonyms:
  - -m
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <name of reference sequence> Optional; default is to search for best
    candidate (if entered, the sequence will be extracted, written to a separate file,
    and blasted against the original input file)
  synonyms:
  - -r
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <names of comma-separated sequences to be excluded from this analysis>
    Optional
  synonyms:
  - -x
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <T/F> Retain original names in output files T(rue)/F(alse). Optional
    (default = T;) option F is to output the 15 character name abbreviations (stripped
    of potentially problematic characters) that is used in the program
  synonyms:
  - -n
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <Number of sequences to be used in initial search for reference sequence>
    Optional; default is to find the reference sequence by blasting all sequences
    against all sequences, only randomly subsampling when it thinks the blast output
    file might be too large (-s over-rides this)
  synonyms:
  - -s
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
