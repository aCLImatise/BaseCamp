help_text: " Example command: \nFor third-gen sequencing: DBG2OLC LD1 0 Contigs contig.fa\
  \ k 17 KmerCovTh 2 MinOverlap 20 AdaptiveTh 0.005 f reads_file1.fq/fa f reads_file2.fq/fa\n\
  For sec-gen sequencing: DBG2OLC LD1 0 Contigs contig.fa k 31 KmerCovTh 0 MinOverlap\
  \ 50 PathCovTh 1 f reads_file1.fq/fa f reads_file2.fq/fa\nParameters:\nMinLen: min\
  \ read length for a read to be used.\nContigs:  contig file to be used.\nk: k-mer\
  \ size.\nLD: load compressed reads information. You can set to 1 if you have run\
  \ the algorithm for one round and just want to fine tune the following parameters.\n\
  PARAMETERS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR THE PERFORMANCE:\nIf you have high coverage, set\
  \ large values to these parameters.\nKmerCovTh: k-mer matching threshold for each\
  \ solid contig. (suggest 2-10)\nMinOverlap: min matching k-mers for each two reads.\
  \ (suggest 10-150)\nAdaptiveTh: [Specific for third-gen sequencing] adaptive k-mer\
  \ threshold for each solid contig. (suggest 0.001-0.02)\nPathCovTh: [Specific for\
  \ Illumina sequencing] occurence threshold for a compressed read. (suggest 1-3)\n\
