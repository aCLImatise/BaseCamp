help_text: "Usage: Compute pseudo p-vals from a set correlations obtained from permuted\
  \ data.\nPseudo p-vals are the percentage of times a correlation at least as extreme\
  \ as the \"real\" one was observed in simulated datasets. \np-values can be either\
  \ two-sided (considering only the correlation magnitude) or one-sided (accounting\
  \ for the sign of correlations).\nFiles containing the permuted correlations should\
  \ be named with a consistent template, where only the iteration number changes.\n\
  The permutation naming template is the second input argument with the iteration\
  \ number replaced with a \"#\" character.\nThe template cannot contain additional\
  \ \"#\" characters.\nThe total number of simulated sets is the third.\n\nUsage:\
  \   python PseudoPvals.py real_cor_file perm_template num_simulations [options]\n\
  Example: python PseudoPvals.py example/basis_corr/cor_sparcc.out example/pvals/perm_cor_#.txt\
  \ 5 -o pvals.txt -t one_sided\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help            show this help\
  \ message and exit\n  -t TYPE, --type=TYPE  Type of p-values to computed.  oned-sided\
