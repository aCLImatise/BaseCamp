  \ <reference.fasta>\n\nReads BAM format from stdin and outputs BAM format to stdout,\
  \ where \nAS tags containing a (re-)computed alignment scores have been added.\n\
  The alignment scores are the sum of base qualities at mismatch positions\nas extracted\
  \ from the phred string.\n\nIf given filename ends on \".gz\", its contents is unzipped.\n\
  \nNOTE: The first word of the sequence names in <reference.fasta> is used,\ni.e.\
  \ if fasta line is \n>chr1 xyz\nthen only \"chr1\" is used and searched for in the\
  \ BAM/SAM file.\n\nAllowed options:\n  -p [ --phred_offset ] arg (=33)       Value\
  \ to substract from ASCII code to \n                                        get\
