  \nGiven a BAM file containing alignments from an ATAC-seq\nexperiment and a BED\
  \ file of motifs, creates a matrix of\ncounts of the fragment midpoints around the\
  \ motifs.\n\nBINNING\n=======\n\nEach motif in the BED file is scored for each of\
  \ the given\nfragment length bins.\n\nThe bins are specified as a list of groups,\
  \ each group comprising\none or more bins, and ending with a resolution value, which\n\
  controls how many individual cuts in the extended region around\nthe feature are\
  \ aggregated. Within the feature itself, we always\ncount the cut points for each\
  \ base.\n\nWe recommend using the same resolution in all bins. The following\nexample\
  \ only shows different resolutions to be thorough.\n\nAssume a --bins value of '(36-149\
  \ 1) (150-224 225-324 2) (325-400 5)'.\n\nWith a resolution of 1, every base in\
  \ the extended region\naround motifs overlapping fragments of length 36-149 would\
  \ be\nscored independently; each base's cut count would be added to\nthe matrix.\n\
  \nThe second group, for fragments of length 150-224 or 225-324,\nwith a resolution\
  \ of 2, would result in every two bases in the\nextended region around motifs being\
  \ added together. Then the\naggregate scores of the two bins in the group would\
  \ be summed,\nand the result would be added to the matrix.\n\nThe last bin group,\
  \ (325-400 5), with a resolution of 5, would\nalso produce aggregate scores in the\
  \ extended region, each\nbeing the sum of five bases' cut counts.\n\nTo illustrate,\
  \ assume these settings and an imaginary motif 5\nbases long, with a 10-base extended\
  \ region on either side, and\nfor the sake of example pretend that each fragment\
  \ length bin\nhad the same counts of cut points around the motif, shown\nhere::\n\
  \n    extended region     motif     extended region\n    ------------------- ---------\
  \ -------------------\n    0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 9 2 0 2 7 5 4 4 4 4 3 3 2 1 0\n\n\
  \    The scores for the first bin group, (36-149 1):\n\n    extended region    \
  \ motif     extended region\n    ------------------- --------- -------------------\n\
  \    0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 9 2 0 2 7 5 4 4 4 4 3 3 2 1 0\n\n    The scores for the\
  \ first bin group, (150-224 225-324 2):\n\n    e.r.      motif     e.r.\n    ---------\
  \ --------- ---------\n    1 5 7 8 9 9 2 0 2 7 9 8 7 5 1\n\n    The scores for the\
  \ last bin group, (325-400 5):\n\n    e.r. motif     e.r.\n    ---- --------- ----\n\
  \    9 21 9 2 0 2 7 21 9\n\nParameters\n----------\nbins_string: str\n   A list\
  \ of S-expressions representing groups of bin start and end positions and resolutions.\n\
  \nReturns\n-------\nlist\n   A list of lists of tuples of (start, end, resolution).\n\
  \nINPUT\n=====\n\nBAM files just work.\n\nBED files mean different things to different\
  \ people. We\nrequire a file of tab-separated values, where the first six\nfields\
  \ (and their labels in the BED format documentation at\nhttps://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html)\
  \ are:\n\n1. The reference sequence name ('chrom'): text\n2. The feature start position\
  \ ('chromStart'): integer\n3. The feature end position ('chromEnd'): integer\n4.\
  \ The name of the feature ('name'): text\n5. The feature's score ('score'): number\n\
  6. The feature's strand ('strand'): '+' or '-'\n\nExtra fields are ignored.\n\n\
  OUTPUT\n======\n\nYou can request either discrete or aggregate output. Discrete\n\
  output is intended to be usable as input to CENTIPEDE. After\nyou've run CENTIPEDE,\
  \ you can feed different parts of the\nresulting BED file back into this script\
  \ and request aggregate\noutput to produce a file suitable for plotting with one\
  \ of our\nR scripts. As an example, we like to extract from the CENTIPEDE\noutput\
  \ all motifs with a posterior probability of binding greater\nthan 0.99, and a random\
  \ sampling of motifs with a posterior\nprobability of less than 0.5. Plotting those\
  \ provides a good\nvisual inspection of the results.\n\nEach row of the discrete\
  \ matrix represents the scores around a\nsingle motif from your input BED file.\
  \ The positions reported\ndepend on the resolution specified in the --bins argument.\
  \ For\nexample, specifying a resolution of 1 will result in single\nnucleotide resolution\
  \ -- you'll get the score at each position\nin the extended region around the motif.\
  \ Specifying 10 will\nreport the sum of every 10 positions.\n\nAggregate output\
  \ reports absolute counts and counts divided by\nthe number of motifs for all of\
  \ your motifs at each position\nin the region around the motif, for each fragment\
  \ size bin\nrepresented at that position.\n\n\0\n"
