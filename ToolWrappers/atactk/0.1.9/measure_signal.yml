  \nINPUT\n=====\n\nBAM files just work.\n\nBED files mean different things to different\
  \ people. We\nrequire a file of tab-separated values, where the first six\nfields\
  \ (and their labels in the BED format documentation at\nhttps://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html)\
  \ are:\n\n1. The reference sequence name ('chrom'): text\n2. The feature start position\
  \ ('chromStart'): integer\n3. The feature end position ('chromEnd'): integer\n4.\
  \ The name of the feature ('name'): text\n5. The feature's score ('score'): number\n\
  6. The feature's strand ('strand'): '+' or '-'\n\nExtra fields are ignored.\n\n\
  OUTPUT\n======\n\nA tab-separated value file containing a line for each fragment\
  \ overlapping\nany feature's region. Each line contains three columns:\n\nFeatureMidpoint:\
  \ the absolute position of the feature's midpoint\n\nFragmentMidpoint: the absolute\
  \ position of the fragment midpoint\n\nFragmentMidpointDistanceToFeatureMidpoint:\
  \ the distance in\nnucleotides between the fragment and feature midpoints\n\nFragmentSize:\
  \ the length of the fragment (template length or\ninsert size in SAM terminology)\n\
  \nFragmentPositionRelativeToFeatureMidpoint: if a fragment's cut\npoints both map\
  \ upstream of the feature's midpoint, it's 'L' for\n'left'; if both map downstream\
  \ of the feature's midpoint, it's\n'R' for 'right'; if one cut point maps to each\
  \ side of the\nmidpoint, it's 'O' for 'overlapping'.\n\n\0\n"
