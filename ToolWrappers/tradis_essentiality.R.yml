help_text: "Usage: tradis_essentiality.R data.tab\n\nProduces calls of gene essentiality\
  \ using an adaptation of the method \ndescribed in Langridge et al. Genome Research\
  \ 2009 and Barquist et al. \nNAR 2013. A loess curve is fit to the distribution\
  \ of insertion \nindices, and used to identify the minima between the 'essential'\
  \ and \n'non-essential' distributions. These distributions are then used to fit\
  \ \ngamma distributions, which are then used to calculate log-odds ratios, \nwhich\
  \ are used to determine an insertion-index threshold for gene \nessentiality. Note\
  \ that this analysis requires a saturated mutant \nlibrary, and is not suitable\
  \ for the analysis of data sets with low \ninsertion density. The script produces\
  \ a number of diagnostic plots \nwhich can be used to verify that this condition\
  \ has been met.\n"
