  \ fraction. *\nDistribution of read lengths in the unaligned fraction. * Distribution\
  \ of read\nlengths in the aligned fraction. * Distribution of alignment lengths.\
  \ *\nDistribution of mapping qualities. * Alignment accuracy. * Alignment identity.\n\
  * Distribution of deletion lengths. * Distribution of insertion lengths. Per\nreference\
  \ plots (can be disabled by -x): * Relative coverage across reference.\n* Mean qualities\
