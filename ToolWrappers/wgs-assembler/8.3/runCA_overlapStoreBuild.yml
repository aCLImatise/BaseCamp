  \nThis will create an overlap store in three phases.\n\nThe first phase will read\
  \ overlapper outputs found in the '-i inp' directory and write them to the\nstore\
  \ directory.  The store directory is in 'wrk/asm.typStore'.  Overlaps are organized\
  \ into\n'buckets' with 'slices'.  A bucket corresponds to a single overlapper output,\
  \ while a slice is a\nrange of overlaps (based on fragment ID).  There will be one\
  \ job for each overlap output file.\n\nThe '-jobs j' parameter tells how many slices\
  \ to make.  More slices means more sort jobs, but each\njob needs less memory. \
  \ The maximum number of jobs is dictated by the operating system, as the\nnumber\
  \ of open files per process.\n\nThe second phase will read a single slice (from\
  \ multiple buckets) into memory, sort them completely,\nand write the overlaps into\
  \ the store.  The '-memory m' parameter does NOT control how much memory\nis used,\
  \ but ONLY tells SGE how much memory each job requires.  There is NO control over\
  \ how much\nmemory is needed, however, if a job needs more memory than requested,\
  \ it will exit doing nothing.\n\nThe third phase will check that all sort jobs in\
  \ the second phase finished successfully, and create\na master index for the store.\
  \  It is sequential, low memory and generally quick.\n\nExample:\n\n/usr/local/bin/runCA-overlapStoreBuild\
  \ \\\n  -d /work/assembly/godzilla-v1 \\\n  -p godzilla \\\n  -t ovl \\\n  -g /work/assembly/godzilla-v1/godzilla.gkpStore\
  \ \\\n  -i /scratch/godzillaovl/ \\\n  -jobs 100\n\nThis will load overlaps in /scratch/godzillaovl/001,\
  \ /002, /003, etc into\nstore /work/assembly/godzilla-v1/godzilla.ovlStore.\n\n"
