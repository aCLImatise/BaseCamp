  description: 'The maximum uncorrected PacBio gap that will be allowed. When there
    is no short-read coverage for a region, by default the pipeline will split a PacBio
    sequence. This option allows a number of PacBio sequences without short-read coverage
    to remain. For example, specifying 50, will mean 50bp can have no short-read coverage
    without splitting the PacBio sequence. Warning: this will allow more sequences
    that went through the SMRTportal to not be fixed.'

  description: The percentage of short reads to use to recruit other PacBio sequences

    lead to a longer runtime but more gaps being recovered. The default is 0.010000
