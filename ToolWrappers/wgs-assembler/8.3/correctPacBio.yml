  description: 'The maximum uncorrected PacBio gap that will be allowed. When there
    is no short-read coverage for a region, by default the pipeline will split a PacBio
    sequence. This option allows a number of PacBio sequences without short-read coverage
    to remain. For example, specifying 50, will mean 50bp can have no short-read coverage
    without splitting the PacBio sequence. Warning: this will allow more sequences
    that went through the SMRTportal to not be fixed.'

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The percentage of short reads to use to recruit other PacBio sequences
    to fill coverage gaps. Must be a decimal value between 0 and 1. Higher values
    lead to a longer runtime but more gaps being recovered. The default is 0.010000

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The percentage of mates used to estimate the library insert size. Must
    be a decimal value between 0 and 1. For example, specifying 0.10 will use 10 percent
    of the mates to estimate the insert size. The default is 0.050000

  description: consider a pileup of 2.000000 times the mean for a single corrected
    read to be a repeat and distribute reads to their best locations (this is only
    useful for metagenomic or non-even coverage datasets. Otherwise the global repeat
    estimate is used instead)
