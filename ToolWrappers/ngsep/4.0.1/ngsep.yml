  \ the genotype calls included in two different VCF files\n  > VCFSummaryStats\n\
  \          Generates a report with the numbers of variants included in a VCF file\
  \ for different categories.\n  > VCFDiversityStats\n          Calculates basic diversity\
  \ statistics for each variant in a VCF file.\n  > VCFVariantDensityCalculator\n\
  \          Calculates the density of variants in a VCF file across the genome\n\
