  \      In this format, the file structure is governed with headers:\n          \
  \                    \t* the 'SAMPLE' column lists the sample names\n          \
  \                    \t* the 'BARCODEn' columns list the matching BARCODE from the\
  \ BARCODEn slot (where n is a \n                              number, see RL option).\
  \ \n                              \t    It is mandatory to have as many 'BARCODEn'\
  \ columns as described BARCODE slots in \n                              READ LAYOUTS.\
  \ Here again, barcodes can be combined using the OR operator '|'\n             \
  \                 \t* the optional 'OUTn' columns (where n is a number) list the\
  \ output file names for this \n                              sample and matching\
  \ output number.\n                              \n                             \
  \    ### SIMPLE Barcode File Format (for backward compatibility) ; please see the\
  \ GENERAL \n                              format described above \n            \
  \                  The file must have 2 columns with the sample in col1 and the\

  \                 In this format, a simple BARCODE slot is expected in the ReadLayout\
  \ and NO headers are \n                              needed e.g. :\n           \

  CCAA\n                              \tThe format accept the following shortcuts:\
  \ \n                              \t1. If multiple barcodes map to the same sample,\
  \ either lines can be duplicated e.g.\n                              \t\tsample1\t\

  \                          \tOr barcodes can be combined using the OR operator '|'\
  \ i.e. the file above can be \n                              re-written like\n \

  \                      i.e. with BARCODE1 and BARCODE2 described for read one and\

  \ with ATAT barcode from BARCODE1 slot \n                              AND GAGG\
  \ barcode from BARCODE2 slot. Note that you can still combine barcodes using | \n\

  \ <BARCODEn:X>, \n                              <SAMPLEn:X> blocks to describe blocks\
  \ of type UMI, BARCODE or SAMPLE with : \n                                  * 'n'\
  \ the unique block index (an index must be unique across all read layouts for \n\
  \                              each index or each block type), use the same index\
  \ to specify redundant blocks e.g. use \n                              <BARCODE1:6>\
  \ in two different layouts to specify that the barcode found in both reads are \n\
  \                              the same\n                                 * 'X'\
  \ : either a number indicating the length of the UMI, BARCODE or SAMPLE block or\
  \ a \n                              negative number e.g. -2 to specify the last\
  \ 2 bases should be ignored/clipped) or the \n                              letter\
  \ 'x' to specify to take the sequence till the end of read. Importantly, the 'x'\
  \ or \n                              negative length shortcuts can *only* be used\
  \ in the last block of a read layout (i.e. \n                              <BARCODE1:x><SAMPLE1:20>\
  \ is not allowed)\n                              In addition, layouts can contain\
  \ N or fixed bases like in 'NN<BARCODE1:6>NNNN<SAMPLE1:x>' \n                  \
  \            where the Ns tell Je to skip 2 and 4 bases before extracting the barcode\
