  \ exhaustive docking of a small representative part of the\n     whole library.\n\
  2nd) Store the result of sdreport -t over that exhaustive dock.\n     in file <sdreport_file>\

  \ <output_file> <thr1max> <thr1min> <ns1> <ns2>\n     <ns1> and <ns2> are the number\
  \ of steps in stage 1 and in\n     stage 2. If not present, the default values are\
  \ 5 and 15\n     <thrmax> and <thrmin> setup the range of thresholds that will\n\
  \     be simulated in stage 1. The threshold of stage 2 depends\n     on the value\
  \ of the threshold of stage 1.\n     An input of -22 -24 will try protocols:\n \

  \   represents the time. This is a percentage of the time it\n     would take to\
  \ do the docking in exhaustive mode, i.e. \n     docking each ligand 100 times.\
  \ Anything\n     above 12 is too long.\n     Second column is the first percentage.\
  \ Percentage of\n     ligands that pass the first stage.\n     Third column is the\
  \ second percentage. Percentage of\n     ligands that pass the second stage.\n \
  \    The four last columns represent the protocol.\n     All the protocols tried\
  \ are written at the end.\n     The ones for which time is less than 12%, perc1\
  \ is\n     less than 30% and perc2 is less than 5% but bigger than 1%\n     will\
  \ have a series of *** after, to indicate they are good choices\n     WARNING! This\
  \ is a simulation based in a small set.\n     The numbers are an indication, not\
  \ factual values.\n"
