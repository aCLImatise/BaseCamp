help_text: "NAME\n    pslMap.pl combine two psl files transitively\n\nSYNOPSIS\n \
  \   pslMap.pl [ --filterunspliced ] --in=in.psl --map=map.psl --out=out.psl\n\n\
  \        If in and map are considered to be mappings from the query to the target,\
  \ then\n        out is the consecutive application of in and map. The map is assumed\
  \ to not contain mismatches.\n        In contrast to the UCSC pslMap C program,\
  \ this program is reporting the mismatches of in.psl in\n        the output alignments.\n\
  \nOPTIONS\n      in               psl input file, e.g. from an alignment of transcript\
  \ reads against mRNA sequences\n      map              psl input file, e.g. from\
  \ an alignment of mRNA sequences against a genome\n                       The queries\
  \ of map must be the targets of in.\n      out              psl output file, e.g.\
  \ the inferred alignment of transcript reads against the genome\n      filterunspliced\
  \  alignments in in.psl that do not cover an intron in map.psl are not reported\
  \ in out.psl\n      minmatch         filter out alignments with a number of matches\
  \ (first column) that is below this (default: 0)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n        The planned\
  \ typical usage of this script is for RNA-Seq alignment.\n        Then in.psl can\
  \ contain alignments of reads against small exon-exon windows (or candidates thereof)\n\
  \        and can be done with a fast almost exact mapper that does no spliced alignments.\n\
  \        out.pl will then be the spliced alignments of the reads against the genome.\n\
  \        The option --filterunspliced can then be used to ensure that read alignments\
  \ are not reported twice.\n        The unspliced alignments can be done directly\
  \ to the genome and the spliced only through this indirect approach.\n        Example\
  \ input visualized:\n    \n            map target (genome)\n         \\        \
  \   \\      /           /\n          \\           \\    /           /\n        \
  \   \\           \\  /           /\n            \\           \\/           /\n \
  \            ------------------------   map query = in target (mRNA)\n         \
