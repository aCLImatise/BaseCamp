help_text: "joingenes - merge several gene sets into one, including the combination\
  \ of transcripts to new ones not present in input\nThis program works in several\
  \ steps:\n  1. divide the set of all transcripts into smaller sets, in which all\
  \ transcripts are on the same sequence and are overlapping at least with one other\
  \ transcript in this set (set is called \"overlap\")\n  2. delete all duplications\
  \ of transcripts and save the variant with the highest \"score\"\n  3. if sequence\
  \ ranges are set for some transcripts, the program detects, whether the distance\
  \ to that range is dangerously close\n  4. join:\n    4.1. if there is a transcript\
  \ dangerously close to one/both end(s) of a sequence range, the program creates\
  \ a copy without the corresponding terminal exon\n    4.2. if there is a transcript\
  \ with start or stop codon in a set and a second one without this codon and they\
  \ are \"joinable\", than this step joines the corresponesponding terminal exons\n\
  \  5. selection: selects the \"best\" gene structure out of all possible \"maximum\"\
  \ gene structures\n    - \"maximum\" gene structure is a set of transcripts from\
