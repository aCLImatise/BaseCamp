help_text: "rbt-collapse-reads-to-fragments-bam \nFelix MÃ¶lder <felix.moelder@uni-due.de>\n\
  Tool to merge sets of PCR duplicate reads from a BAM file into one maximum likelihood\
  \ fragment sequence each with\naccordingly improved base quality scores.\n\nTakes\
  \ a BAM file and returns a BAM file in which all PCR duplicates have been merged\
  \ into a consensus read.\nDuplicates must be marked by Picard Tools using the TAG_DUPLICATE_SET_MEMBERS\
  \ option.\n\nAssumptions:\n  - Reads are of equal length\n  - Reads are marked by\
  \ Picard Tools\n\n\n\nUSAGE:\n    rbt collapse-reads-to-fragments bam [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]\
  \ <bam> <consensus-bam>\n\nFLAGS:\n    -h, --help                  Prints help information\n\

  \ can yield\n                                very long FASTQ name lines which cannot\
