  \ show name and description of\n                        the file as well. However\

  \ show the smaller and faster\n                        binary bigWig file at UCSC\

  \                If True, MACS will SAVE signal per million reads for\n        \
  \                fragment pileup profiles. It won't interfere with\n           \
  \             computing pvalue/qvalue during peak calling, since\n             \
  \           internally MACS2 keeps using the raw pileup and\n                  \
  \      scaling factors between larger and smaller dataset to\n                 \
  \       calculate statistics measurements. If you plan to use\n                \
  \        the signal output in bedGraph to call peaks using\n                   \
  \     bdgcmp and bdgpeakcall, you shouldn't use this option\n                  \
  \      because you will end up with different results.\n                       \
  \ However, this option is recommended for displaying\n                        normalized\
  \ pileup tracks across many datasets. Require\n                        -B to be\
  \ set. Default: False\n\nShifting model arguments:\n  --nomodel             Whether\

  \ 100, try to set extsize to change it.\n                        It's highly recommended\
  \ that while you have many\n                        datasets to process and you\
  \ plan to compare different\n                        conditions, aka differential\
  \ calling, use both\n                        'nomodel' and 'extsize' to make signal\

  \  --shift SHIFT         (NOT the legacy --shiftsize option!) The arbitrary\n  \

  \                    than default value. When NOMODEL is set, MACS will use\n  \
  \                      this value to move cutting ends (5') towards 5'->3'\n   \
  \                     direction then apply EXTSIZE to extend them to\n         \
  \               fragments. When this value is negative, ends will be\n         \
  \               moved toward 3'->5' direction. Recommended to keep it\n        \
  \                as default 0 for ChIP-Seq datasets, or -1 * half of\n         \
  \               EXTSIZE together with EXTSIZE option for detecting\n           \

  \         format is BAMPE or BEDPE for paired-end data. DEFAULT:\n             \
  \           0.\n  --extsize EXTSIZE     The arbitrary extension size in bp. When\
  \ nomodel is\n                        true, MACS will use this value as fragment\
  \ size to\n                        extend each read towards 3' end, then pile them\
  \ up.\n                        It's exactly twice the number of obsolete SHIFTSIZE.\n\
  \                        In previous language, each read is moved 5'->3'\n     \
  \                   direction to middle of fragment by 1/2 d, then\n           \
  \             extended to both direction with 1/2 d. This is\n                 \
  \       equivalent to say each read is extended towards 5'->3'\n               \
  \         into a d size fragment. DEFAULT: 200. EXTSIZE and\n                  \
