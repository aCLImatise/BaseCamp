  \ <FASTA file1> [FASTA file2...]\n\n\tWill return tag file of uniquely mappable\
  \ positions to STDOUT\n\n\tThis program can take a long time to finish, and uses\
  \ a bunch of memory.\n\tIt works (naively) by loading # sequences at a time into\
  \ a hashtable, then\n\tscreening the rest of the genome for matches (both strands).\
  \  But it works :)\n\tFor Homer to use the output, use \"homerTools special uniqmap\"\
