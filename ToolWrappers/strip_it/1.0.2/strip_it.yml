  \ scaffolds are written.\n    The file is a text file with on each row the original\
  \ molecule\n    and the generated scaffolds in SMILES format. If this option is\
  \ \n    not provided, then all scaffolds are written to standard output.\n\n  --inputFormat\
  \ <format>\n    Specifies the input file format. If not provided then the format\n\
