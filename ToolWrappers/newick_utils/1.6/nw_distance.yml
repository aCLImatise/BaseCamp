help_text: "Prints distances between nodes, following tree branches, in various ways.\n\
  \nSynopsis\n--------\n\nnw_distance [-hmnst] <tree file|-> [label]*\n\nInput\n-----\n\
  \nFirst argument is the name of a file containing one or more trees, or '-'\n(in\
  \ which case trees are read from standard input). Any subsequent arguments\nare\
  \ node labels.\n\nOutput\n------\n\nOutput is controlled by the mode and the selection.\
  \ The mode specifies how\nto compute distances, and the selection specifies which\
  \ nodes to compute\ndistances for. There are four modes:\n    o root mode (default):\
  \ print distances from the tree's root to all\n      nodes in the selection\n  \
  \  o last common ancestor mode: print distances from the LCA of all nodes\n    \
  \  in the selection to all nodes in the selection\n    o parent mode: print distances\
  \ from each node in the selection\n      to its parent (0 for the root node)\n \
  \   o matrix mode: print distances from each node in the selection\n      to each\
  \ node in the selection\nValid selections are:\n    o all labeled leaves (default):\
  \ selection is formed by all labeled\n      leaf nodes, in the order in which they\
  \ appear in the Newick string\n      (= Newick order)\n    o all labeled nodes:\
  \ selection is formed by all labeled nodes, in\n      Newick order (see Option -s)\n\
  \    o all leaves: selection is formed by all leaves nodes, in\n      Newick order\
  \ (see Option -s)\n    o all internal nodes: selection is formed by all internal\
  \ nodes, in\n      Newick order (see Option -s)\n    o all nodes: selection is formed\
  \ by all nodes, in Newick order\n      (see Option -s)\n    o command line arguments:\
  \ labels are passed on the command line,\n      and the selection is formed by the\
  \ corresponding nodes, in the\n      same order.\n\nOptions\n-------\n\n    -h:\
  \ print this message and exit \n    -m <mode>: selects mode (see Output). Mode is\
  \ determined by the first\n        letter of the argument: 'r' for root mode (default),\
  \ 'l' for LCA,\n        'p' for parent, and 'm' for matrix. Thus, '-mm', '-m matrix',\n\
  \        and '-m mat' all select matrix mode.\n    -n: prints labels (or '' if empty)\
  \ in addition to distances.\n    -s <selection>, where selection is determined by\
  \ the first letter of\n        the argument: 'a' for all nodes, 'l' for labeled\
  \ nodes,\n        'i' for inner nodes, 'f' for leaves.\n        E.g. '-s a' and\
  \ '-s all' both select all nodes.\n    -t: in matrix mode, print a triangular matrix.\
  \ In other modes,\n        print values on a line, separated by TABs.\n\nAssumptions\
  \ and Limitations\n---------------------------\n\nLabels passed as arguments are\
  \ assumed to exist in the tree. Behaviour is\nundefined if a label is not found.\n\
  \nExamples\n--------\n\n$ nw_distance data/catarrhini\t# all (labeled) leaves, from\
  \ root\n\n# Pongo and Homo, from their LCA, with labels, single line\n$ nw_distance\
  \ -m lca -t -n data/catarrhini Homo Pongo \n\n# All labeled nodes, matrix form,\
  \ with labels\n$ nw_distance -mm -n -sl data/catarrhini\n\n# All nodes, distance\
  \ to parent\n$ nw_distance -m p -s a data/catarrhini\n"
