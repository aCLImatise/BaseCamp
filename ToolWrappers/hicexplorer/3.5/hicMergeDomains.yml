  \nhicMergeDomains takes as input multiple TAD domain files from hicFindTads. It\
  \ merges TADs from different resolutions to one TAD domains file,\nconsiders protein\
  \ peaks from known TAD binding sites and computes a dependency graph of the TADs.\n\
  \nTwo TADs are considered as one if they don't overlap at x bins given by `--value`;\
  \ TAD borders need to match the protein peaks given by `--proteinFile`;\na relation\
  \ between two TADs is given by their overlap of area in percent, parameter `--percent`.\
  \ The protein peaks are only considered if in one bin at least `--minPeak`.\n\n\
  An example usage is:\n\n`$ hicMergeDomains --domainFiles 10kbtad_domains.bed 50kbtad_domains.bed\
  \ --proteinFile ctcf_sorted.bed --outputMergedList two_files_ctcf --outputRelationList\
