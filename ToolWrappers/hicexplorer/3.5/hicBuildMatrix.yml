  \             adjusted if too many low quality (but otherwise\n                \
  \        perfectly valid Hi-C reads) are found. A good strategy\n              \
  \          is to make a test run (using the --doTestRun), then\n               \
  \         checking the results to see if too many low quality\n                \
  \        reads are present and then using the bam file\n                       \
  \ generated to check if those low quality reads are\n                        caused\
  \ by the read not being mapped entirely.\n                        (default: 15)\n\
  \  --threads THREADS     Number of threads. Using the python multiprocessing\n \
  \                       module. One master process which is used to read the\n \
  \                       input file into the buffer and one process which is\n  \
  \                      merging the output bam files of the processes into one\n\
  \                        output bam file. All other threads do the actual\n    \
  \                    computation. Minimum value for the '--thread'\n           \
  \             parameter is 2. The usage of 8 threads is optimal if\n           \
  \             you have an HDD. A higher number of threads is only\n            \
  \            useful if you have a fast SSD. Have in mind that the\n            \
  \            performance of hicBuildMatrix is influenced by the\n              \
  \          number of threads, the speed of your hard drive and\n               \
  \         the inputBufferSize. To clarify: the performance with\n              \
  \          a higher thread number is not negative influenced but\n             \
  \           not positive too. With a slow HDD and a high number of\n           \
  \             threads many threads will do nothing most of the time.\n         \
  \               (default: 4)\n  --inputBufferSize INPUTBUFFERSIZE\n            \
  \            Size of the input buffer of each thread. 400,000 read\n           \
  \             pairs per input file per thread is the default value.\n          \
  \              Reduce this value to decrease memory usage. (default:\n         \
  \               400000)\n  --doTestRun           A test run is useful to test the\
  \ quality of a Hi-C\n                        experiment quickly. It works by testing\
  \ only 1,000,000\n                        reads. This option is useful to get an\
  \ idea of quality\n                        control values like inter-chromosomal\
  \ interactions,\n                        duplication rates etc. (default: False)\n\
  \  --doTestRunLines DOTESTRUNLINES\n                        Number of lines to consider\
  \ for the qc test run.\n                        (default: 1000000)\n  --skipDuplicationCheck\n\
  \                        Identification of duplicated read pairs is memory\n   \
  \                     consuming. Thus, in case of memory errors this check\n   \
  \                     can be skipped. However, consider running a\n            \
  \            `--doTestRun` first to get an estimation of the\n                 \
  \       duplicated reads. (default: False)\n  --chromosomeSizes txt file, -cs txt\
  \ file\n                        File with the chromosome sizes for your genome.\

  \ is\n                        expectedUsually the sizes can be determined from the\n\
  \                        SAM/BAM input files, however, for cHi-C or scHi-C it\n\
  \                        can be that at the start or end no data is present.\n \
  \                       Please consider that this option causes that only\n    \
