help_text: "\nBandage info takes a graph file as input and outputs (to stdout) the\
  \ following statistics about the graph:\n  * Node count: The number of nodes in\
  \ the graph. Only positive nodes are counted (i.e. each complementary pair counts\
  \ as one).\n  * Edge count: The number of edges in the graph. Only one edge in each\
  \ complementary pair is counted.\n  * Smallest edge overlap: The smallest overlap\
  \ size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\n  * Largest edge overlap: The smallest\
  \ overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph. For most graphs this will be\
  \ the same as the smallest edge overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n\
  \  * Total length: The total number of base pairs in the graph.\n  * Total length\
  \ no overlaps: The total number of base pairs in the graph, subtracting bases that\
  \ are duplicated in edge overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances where\
  \ an end of a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n  * Percentage dead ends:\
  \ The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number of dead ends is twice\
  \ the number of nodes (occurs when there are no edges), so this value is the number\
  \ of dead ends divided by twice the node count.\n  * Connected components: The number\
  \ of regions of the graph which are disconnected from each other.\n  * Largest component:\
  \ The total number of base pairs in the largest connected component.\n  * N50: Nodes\
  \ that are this length or greater will collectively add up to at least half of the\
  \ total length.\n  * Shortest node: The length of the shortest node in the graph.\n\
  \  * Lower quartile node: The median node length for the shorter half of the nodes.\n\
  \  * Median node: The median node length for the graph.\n  * Upper quartile node:\
  \ The median node length for the longer half of the nodes.\n  * Longest node: The\
  \ length of the longest node in the graph.\n  * Median depth: The median depth of\
  \ the graph, by base.\n  * Estimated sequence length: An estimate of the total number\
  \ of bases in the original sequence, calculated by multiplying each node's length\
  \ (minus overlaps) by its depth relative to the median.\n          \nUsage:    Bandage\
