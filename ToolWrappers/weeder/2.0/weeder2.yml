help_text: "\nSYNTAX\n\nweeder2 -f input_file [-O frequency_file_organism_code] [options]\n\
  \ninput_file must be in Multi-FASTA format.\n\nWhen no organism code for oligo frequency\
  \ files is provided it is assumed to be HS (Homo sapiens).\n\nOligo frequency files\
  \ for the following organisms are available in the standard Weeder 2.0 package:\
  \ \n\nHomo sapiens - Code: HS\nMus musculus - Code: MM\nDrosophila melanogaster\
  \ - Code: DM\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae - Code: SC\nArabidopsis thaliana - Code:\
  \ AT\n\nOther frequency files  may be added to the FreqFiles directory by using\
  \ the \"Frequency maker\" program\navailable at http://www.beaconlab.it/modtools\n\
  \nOPTIONS\n\n-chipseq\nThis flag activates the ChIP-Seq heuristic speeding-up the\
  \ computation.\n\n-top <num> (DEFAULT: 100)\nIf the -chipseq parameter is used Weeder\
  \ 2.0 scans all the input sequences for occurrences of the oligos contained in the\
  \ top <num> input sequences.\nIncrease this value when your input has many more\
  \ than <num> sequences to improve the chance of finding motifs enriched only \n\
  in a subset of your input sequences.\n\n-b <num> (DEFAULT: 50)\nWeeder 2.0 builds\
  \ occurrences matrix profiles and outputs (if other conditions are met) only the\
  \ top <num> scoring motifs\nfor each motif length. Increase this value to have more\
  \ (lowest scoring) motifs in the output (see also -maxm).\n\n-maxm <num> (DEFAULT:\
  \ 25)\nTo limit the output length, Weeder 2.0 reports only the top <num> scoring\
  \ motifs with their associated occurrences\nmatrix and occurrences list. Increase\
  \ <num> to have longer outputs with more lowest scoring motifs.\n\n-ss\nSingle strand\
  \ mode.\n\nADVANCED OPTIONS\n\n-sim <num> (DEFAULT: 0.95 MIN: 0 MAX: 1)\nSimilarity\
  \ threshold for the redundancy filter. This filter removes from the output those\
  \ motifs that are too similar to other motifs\nalready reported. Values close to\
  \ 0 mean a stricter filter and vice versa values close to 1 impose a looser filter.\n\
  Set <num> to 1 to disable the filter altogether. Set it to 0 to have in the output\
  \ only the top scoring oligo for each one of\nthe possible oligo lengths (6, 8 and\
  \ 10).\n\n-em <num> (DEFAULT: 1 MIN: 0 MAX: 100)\nWeeder 2.0 has a built-in expectation\
  \ maximization (EM) matrix profiles refinement step.\n<num> defines the number of\
  \ EM cycles to be performed by Weeder 2.0.\nOne (default) or few EM cycles should\
  \ be sufficient to \"clean\" matrix profiles without overfitting them.\n\n\n"
