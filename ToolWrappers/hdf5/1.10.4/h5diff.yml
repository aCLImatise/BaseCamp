  \ File comparison:\n  If no objects [obj1[ obj2]] are specified, the h5diff comparison\
  \ proceeds as\n  a comparison of the two files' root groups.  That is, h5diff first\
  \ compares\n  the names of root group members, generates a report of root group\
  \ objects\n  that appear in only one file or in both files, and recursively compares\n\
  \  common objects.\n\n Object comparison:\n  1) Groups\n      First compares the\
  \ names of member objects (relative path, from the\n      specified group) and generates\
  \ a report of objects that appear in only\n      one group or in both groups. Common\
  \ objects are then compared recursively.\n  2) Datasets\n      Array rank and dimensions,\
  \ datatypes, and data values are compared.\n  3) Datatypes\n      The comparison\
  \ is based on the return value of H5Tequal.\n  4) Symbolic links\n      The paths\
  \ to the target objects are compared.\n      (The option --follow-symlinks overrides\
  \ the default behavior when\n       symbolic links are compared.).\n\n Exit code:\n\
  \  0 if no differences, 1 if differences found, 2 if error\n\n Examples of use:\n\
  \ 1) h5diff file1 file2 /g1/dset1 /g1/dset2\n    Compares object '/g1/dset1' in\
  \ file1 with '/g1/dset2' in file2\n\n 2) h5diff file1 file2 /g1/dset1\n    Compares\
  \ object '/g1/dset1' in both files\n\n 3) h5diff file1 file2\n    Compares all objects\
  \ in both files\n\n Notes:\n  file1 and file2 can be the same file.\n  Use h5diff\
  \ file1 file1 /g1/dset1 /g1/dset2 to compare\n  '/g1/dset1' and '/g1/dset2' in the\
  \ same file\n\n"
