  \ reads:\n    cutadapt -a ADAPT1 -A ADAPT2 [options] -o out1.fastq -p out2.fastq\

  \ adapter. IUPAC wildcard\ncharacters are supported. All reads from input.fastq\
  \ will be written to\noutput.fastq with the adapter sequence removed. Adapter matching\
  \ is\nerror-tolerant. Multiple adapter sequences can be given (use further -a\n\
  options), but only the best-matching adapter will be removed.\n\nInput may also\
  \ be in FASTA format. Compressed input and output is supported and\nauto-detected\

  \          Discard reads longer than LEN. Default: no limit\n  --max-n COUNT   \
  \      Discard reads with more than COUNT 'N' bases. If COUNT\n                \
  \        is a number between 0 and 1, it is interpreted as a\n                 \

  \                        Which type of report to print: 'full' or 'minimal'.\n \

  \          Write trimmed reads to FILE. FASTQ or FASTA format is\n             \
  \           chosen depending on input. Summary report is sent to\n             \
  \           standard output. Use '{name}' for demultiplexing (see\n            \
  \            docs). Default: write to standard output\n  --fasta               Output\
  \ FASTA to standard output even on FASTQ input.\n  -Z                    Use compression\
  \ level 1 for gzipped output files\n                        (faster, but uses more\
  \ space)\n  --info-file FILE      Write information about each read and its adapter\n\
  \                        matches into FILE. See the documentation for the file\n\

  \        When the adapter matches in the middle of a read,\n                   \
  \     write the rest (after the adapter) to FILE.\n  --wildcard-file FILE  When\
  \ the adapter has N wildcard bases, write adapter\n                        bases\
  \ matching wildcard positions to FILE. (Inaccurate\n                        with\

  \ FILE. Default: discard reads\n  --too-long-output FILE\n                     \
  \   Write reads that are too long (according to length\n                       \

  \ FILE\n                        Write second read in a pair to FILE.\n  --pair-adapters\
  \       Treat adapters given with -a/-A etc. as pairs. Either\n                \

  \                  Write second read in a pair to this FILE when no\n          \
