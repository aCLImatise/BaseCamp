  NB: by default, featureBits omits gap regions from its calculation of the total\n\
  number of bases.  This requires connecting to a database server using credentials\n\
  from a .hg.conf file (or similar).  If such a connection is not available, you will\n\
  need to specify -countGaps (which skips the database connection) in addition to\n\
  providing all tables as files or directories.\n\n"
