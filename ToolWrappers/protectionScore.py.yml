help_text: "\nUsage: protectionScore.py <FOOTPRINT_FILE> <MPBS_FILE> <DNASE_FILE>\
  \ <GENOME_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE>\n\nInput: \n  FOOTPRINT_FILE: Footprint file (bed\
  \ or bb). Output of rgt-hint program.\n  MPBS_FILE: Motif-predicted binding sites\
  \ file name (bed or bb).\n             Output of rgt-motifanalysis --matching program.\n\
  \  DNASE_FILE: DNase-seq aligned reads file (bam).\n  GENOME_FILE: Genome fasta\

  \nDescription: \n  Evaluates the protection score for every MPBS in MPBS_FILE.\n\
  \  The protection score is evaluated only for MPBSs that\n  overlap with footprints.\
  \ Also, the protection score is based\n  on the bias-corrected version of the DNase-seq\
  \ signal in DNASE_FILE.\n  The correction will be performed based on k-mer frequencies\
  \ estimated\n  on K562 (DNase-seq single-hit protocol). The output file consists\
  \ of a plain\n  tab-separated text file in which each row has the MPBS name and\
  \ its\n  protection score, respectively.\n\n"
