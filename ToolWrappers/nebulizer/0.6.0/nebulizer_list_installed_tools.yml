help_text: "Usage: nebulizer list_installed_tools [OPTIONS] GALAXY\n\n  List installed\
  \ tool repositories.\n\n  Prints details of installed tool repositories in GALAXY\
  \ instance.\n\n  For each installed repository the details include: repository name,\n\
  \  toolshed, owner, revision id and changeset, and installation status.\n\n  Repository\
  \ details are also preceeded by a single-character 'status'\n  indicator ('D' =\
  \ deprecated; '^' = newer revision installed; 'u' = update\n  available but not\
  \ installed; 'U' = upgrade available but not installed;\n  '*' = latest revision).\n\
  \n  Note that there may still be a newer revision of a tool available from the\n\
  \  toolshed, even when the repository is marked as '*'. Use the --check-\n  toolshed\
  \ option to also explicitly check against the toolshed, in which\n  case a '!' status\
  \ indicates that a newer version has been found on\n  toolshed. Note that this option\
  \ incurs a significant overhead when\n  checking a large number of tools.\n\n  If\
  \ the --list-tools option is specified then additionally after each\n  repository\
  \ the tools associated with the repository will be listed along\n  with their descriptions\
  \ and versions.\n\nOptions:\n  --name NAME          only list tool repositories\
  \ matching NAME. Can include\n                       glob-style wild-cards.\n  --toolshed\

  \    only list repositories from matching OWNER. Can include\n                 \

  \ directly against those\n                       available in the toolshed. NB this\
  \ can be extremely\n                       slow.\n  --help               Show this\
