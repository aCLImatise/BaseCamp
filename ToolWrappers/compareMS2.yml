help_text: "compareMS2 - (c) Magnus Palmblad 2010-\n\ncompareMS2 is developed to compare,\
  \ globally, all MS/MS spectra between two datasets (in Mascot Generic Format or\
  \ MGF) acquired under similar conditions. This may be useful for differentiating\
  \ samples or molecular phylogenetics based on shared peptide sequences quantified\
  \ by the number or frequency of highly similar tandem mass spectra. The similarity\
  \ between a pair of tandem mass spectra is calculated essentially as in SpectraST\
  \ [see Lam et al. Proteomics 2007, 7, 655-667 (2007)].\n\nusage: compareMS2 -1 <first\
  \ dataset filename> -2 <second dataset filename> [-o <output filename> -p <maximum\
  \ difference in precursor mass>]\n"
