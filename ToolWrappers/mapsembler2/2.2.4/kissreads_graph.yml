  \ [-c min_coverage] [-d max_substitutions] [-o name] [-h] \n\nDESCRIPTION\nkissreads_graph\
  \ maps the provided reads on the graph\nWith option \"-t coverage\": outputs an\
  \ equivalent graph removing uncovered edges and adding:\n\t for each node: the coverage\
  \ per sample and per position\n\t for each edge: the number of mapped reads per\
  \ sample using this edge\nWith option \"-t modify\": outputs the same simplified\
  \ graph:\n\t removing low covered edges and nodes (less that min_coverage)\n\t then\
  \ phasing simple non branching paths\nIf -M option is specified, the input is considered\
  \ as a Mapsembler output - thus composed of multiple independant graphes\n\nMANDATORY\n\
