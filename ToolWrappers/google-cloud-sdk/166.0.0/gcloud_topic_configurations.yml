help_text: "NAME\n    gcloud topic configurations - supplementary help for named configurations\n\
  \nDESCRIPTION\n    gcloud properties can be stored in named configurations, which\
  \ are\n    collections of key-value pairs that influence the behavior of gcloud.\n\
  \n    Named configurations are intended to be an advanced feature, and you can\n\
  \    probably ignore them entirely if you only work with one project.\n\n    Properties\
  \ that are commonly stored in configurations include default\n    Google Compute\
  \ Engine zone, verbosity level, project ID, and active user or\n    service account.\
  \ Configurations allow you to define and enable these and\n    other settings together\
  \ as a group.\n\n    Configurations are especially useful if you:\n      o Work\
  \ with multiple projects. You can create a separate configuration\n        for each\
  \ project.\n      o Use multiple accounts, for example, a user account and a service\n\
  \        account, etc.\n      o Perform generally orthogonal tasks (work on an appengine\
  \ app in\n        project foo, administer a Google Compute Engine cluster in zone\n\
  \        user-central-1a, manage the network configurations for region\n       \
  \ asia-east-1, etc.)\n\n    Property information stored in named configurations\
  \ are readable by all\n    gcloud commands and may be modified by gcloud config\
  \ set and gcloud config\n    unset.\n\nCreating configurations\n\n    Named configurations\
  \ maybe be defined by users or built into gcloud.\n\n    User defined configurations\
  \ have lowercase names, such as 'johndoe',\n    'default', 'jeff-staging', or 'foo2'.\
  \ These are defined by the following\n    regular expression: ^[a-z][-a-z0-9]*$\n\
  \n    Additionally there is a builtin configuration named NONE that has no\n   \
  \ properties set.\n\n    The easiest way to create a brand new configuration is\
  \ by running\n\n        $ gcloud init\n\n    This will guide you through setting\
  \ up your first named configuration,\n    creating a new named configuration, or\
  \ reinitializing an existing named\n    configuration. (Note: reinitializing an\
  \ existing configuration will remove\n    all its existing properties!)\n\n    You\
  \ can create a new empty configuration with\n\n        $ gcloud config configurations\
  \ create my-config\n\nUsing configurations\n\n    gcloud may have at most one active\
  \ configuration which provides property\n    values. Inactive configurations have\
  \ no effect on gcloud executions.\n\n    You can activate a configuration with\n\
  \n        $ gcloud config configurations activate my-config\n\n    You can view\
  \ and change the properties of your active configuration using\n    the following\
  \ commands:\n\n        $ gcloud config list\n        $ gcloud config set\n\n   \
  \ Additionally, commands under gcloud config configurations allow you to to\n  \
  \  list, activate, describe, and delete configurations that may or may not be\n\
  \    active.\n\n    You can activate a configuration for a single gcloud invocation\
  \ using flag,\n    --configuration my-config, or environment variable\n    CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME=my-config.\n\
  \nAVAILABLE PROPERTIES\n     core\n         account\n            The account gcloud\
  \ should use for authentication. You can run\n            gcloud auth list to see\
  \ the accounts you currently have available.\n\n         custom_ca_certs_file\n\
  \            Absolute path to a custom CA cert file.\n\n         default_regional_backend_service\n\
  \            If True, backend services in gcloud compute backend-services will\n\
  \            be regional by default. The --global flag will be required for\n  \
  \          global backend services.\n\n         disable_color\n            If True,\
  \ color will not be used when printing messages in the\n            terminal.\n\n\
  \         disable_prompts\n            If True, the default answer will be assumed\
  \ for all user prompts.\n            For any prompts that require user input, an\
  \ error will be raised.\n            This is equivalent to either using the global\
  \ --quiet flag or\n            setting the environment variable CLOUDSDK_CORE_DISABLE_PROMPTS\
  \ to\n            1.\n\n         disable_usage_reporting\n            If True, anonymous\
  \ statistics on SDK usage will not be collected.\n            This is value is set\
  \ based on your choices during installation, but\n            can be changed at\
  \ any time. For more information, see:\n            https://cloud.google.com/sdk/usage-statistics\n\
  \n         log_http\n            If True, log HTTP requests and responses to the\
  \ logs. You may need\n            to adjust your verbosity setting if you want to\
  \ see in the\n            terminal, otherwise it is available in the log files.\n\
  \n         max_log_days\n            Maximum number of days to retain log files\
  \ before deleting. If set\n            to 0, turns off log garbage collection and\
  \ does not delete log\n            files. If unset, defaults to 30.\n\n        \
  \ pass_credentials_to_gsutil\n            If True, pass the configured Cloud SDK\
  \ authentication to gsutil.\n\n         project\n            The project id of the\
  \ Cloud Platform project to operate on by\n            default. This can be overridden\
  \ by using the global --project flag.\n\n         show_structured_logs\n       \
  \     Controls when JSON structured log messages for the current\n            verbosity\
  \ and above will be written to standard error. The default\n            is text\
  \ format when disabled. Valid values are: never - Log\n            messages as text,\
  \ always - Always log messages as JSON, log - Only\n            log messages as\
  \ JSON if stderr is a file, terminal - Only log\n            messages as JSON if\
  \ stderr is a terminal. If unset default is\n            never.\n\n         trace_token\n\
  \            Token used to route traces of service requests for investigation of\n\
  \            issues. This token will be provided by Google support.\n\n        \
  \ user_output_enabled\n            If False, messages to the user and command output\
  \ on both standard\n            output and standard error will be suppressed.\n\n\
  \         verbosity\n            The default logging verbosity for gcloud commands.\
  \ This is the\n            equivalent of using the global --verbosity flag.\n\n\
  \     app\n         cloud_build_timeout\n            The timeout, in seconds, to\
  \ wait for Docker builds to complete\n            during deployments. All Docker\
  \ builds now use the Container Builder\n            API.\n\n         promote_by_default\n\
  \            If True, when deploying a new version of a service, that version\n\
  \            will be promoted to receive all traffic for the service. The flag\n\
  \            can be overridden via the --promote-by-default or\n            --no-promote-by-default\
  \ flags.\n\n         stop_previous_version\n            If True, when deploying\
  \ a new version of a service, the previously\n            deployed version is stopped.\
  \ If False, older versions must be\n            stopped manually.\n\n         use_runtime_builders\n\
  \            If set, opt in/out to a new code path for building applications\n \
  \           using pre-fabricated runtimes that can be updated independently of\n\

  \           runtime.)\n\n     auth\n         disable_credentials\n            If\
  \ true, gcloud will not attempt to load any credentials or\n            authenticate\
  \ any requests. This is useful if you are behind a proxy\n            that adds\
  \ authentication to your requests.\n\n     component_manager\n         additional_repositories\n\
  \            A comma separated list of additional repositories to check for\n  \
