help_text: "NAME\n  signurl - Create a signed url\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n  gsutil signurl\
  \ [-c content_type] [-d duration] [-m http_method] \\\n      [-p password] keystore-file\
  \ url...\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The signurl command will generate signed urls that\
  \ can be used to access\n  the specified objects without authentication for a specific\
  \ period of time.\n\n  Please see the `Signed URLs documentation\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls>`_\
  \ for\n  background about signed URLs.\n\n  Multiple gs:// urls may be provided\
  \ and may contain wildcards.  A signed url\n  will be produced for each provided\
  \ url, authorized\n  for the specified HTTP method and valid for the given duration.\n\
  \n  Note: Unlike the gsutil ls command, the signurl command does not support\n \
  \ operations on sub-directories. For example, if you run the command:\n\n    gsutil\
  \ signurl <private-key-file> gs://some-bucket/some-object/\n\n  The signurl command\
  \ uses the private key for a  service account (the\n  '<private-key-file>' argument)\
  \ to generate the cryptographic\n  signature for the generated URL. The private\
  \ key file must be in PKCS12\n  or JSON format. If the private key is encrypted\
  \ the signed url command will\n  prompt for the passphrase used to protect the private\
  \ key file\n  (default 'notasecret').  For more information regarding generating\
  \ a private\n  key for use with the signurl command please see the `Authentication\n\
  \  documentation.\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication#generating-a-private-key>`_\n\
  \n  gsutil will look up information about the object \"some-object/\" (with a\n\
  \  trailing slash) inside bucket \"some-bucket\", as opposed to operating on\n \
  \ objects nested under gs://some-bucket/some-object. Unless you actually\n  have\
  \ an object with that name, the operation will fail.\n\nOPTIONS\n  -m          Specifies\
  \ the HTTP method to be authorized for use\n              with the signed url, default\
  \ is GET. You may also specify\n              RESUMABLE to create a signed resumable\
  \ upload start URL. When\n              using a signed URL to start a resumable\
  \ upload session, you will\n              need to specify the 'x-goog-resumable:start'\
  \ header in the\n              request or else signature validation will fail.\n\
  \n  -d          Specifies the duration that the signed url should be valid\n   \
  \           for, default duration is 1 hour.\n\n              Times may be specified\
  \ with no suffix (default hours), or\n              with s = seconds, m = minutes,\
  \ h = hours, d = days.\n\n              This option may be specified multiple times,\
  \ in which case\n              the duration the link remains valid is the sum of\
  \ all the\n              duration options.\n\n  -c          Specifies the content\
  \ type for which the signed url is\n              valid for.\n\n  -p          Specify\
  \ the keystore password instead of prompting.\n\nUSAGE\n  Create a signed url for\
  \ downloading an object valid for 10 minutes:\n\n    gsutil signurl -d 10m <private-key-file>\
  \ gs://<bucket>/<object>\n\n  Create a signed url, valid for one hour, for uploading\
  \ a plain text\n  file via HTTP PUT:\n\n    gsutil signurl -m PUT -d 1h -c text/plain\
  \ <private-key-file> \\\n        gs://<bucket>/<obj>\n\n  To construct a signed\
  \ URL that allows anyone in possession of\n  the URL to PUT to the specified bucket\
  \ for one day, creating\n  an object of Content-Type image/jpg, run:\n\n    gsutil\
  \ signurl -m PUT -d 1d -c image/jpg <private-key-file> \\\n        gs://<bucket>/<obj>\n\
  \n  To construct a signed URL that allows anyone in possession of\n  the URL to\
  \ POST a resumable upload to the specified bucket for one day,\n  creating an object\
  \ of Content-Type image/jpg, run:\n\n    gsutil signurl -m RESUMABLE -d 1d -c image/jpg\
  \ <private-key-file> \\\n        gs://bucket/<obj>\n"
