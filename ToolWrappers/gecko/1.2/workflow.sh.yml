help_text: " ==== GECKO HELP ...\n\n   To run gecko, use:\n   ./gecko/bin/workflow.sh\
  \ query reference length similarity wordLength 1\n\n   Query sequence: The sequence\
  \ that will be compared against the reference. Use only FASTA format.\n    Reference\
  \ sequence: The reference sequence where to look for matches from the query. Note\
  \ that the reverse strand is computed for the reference and also matched. Use only\
  \ FASTA format.\n   Length: This parameter is the minimum length in nucleotides\
  \ for an HSP (similarity fragment) to be conserved. Any HSP below this length will\
  \ be filtered out of the comparison. It is recommended to use around 40 bp for small\
  \ organisms (e.g. bacterial mycoplasma or E. Coli) and around 100 bp or more for\
  \ larger organisms (e.g. human chromosomes).\n   Similarity: This parameter is analogous\
  \ to the minimum length, however, instead of length, the similarity is used as threshold.\
  \ The similarity is calculated as the score attained by an HSP divided by the maximum\
  \ possible score. Use values above 50-60 to filter noise.\n   Word length: This\
  \ parameter is the seed size used to find HSPs. A smaller seed size will increase\
  \ sensitivity and decrease performance, whereas a larger seed size will decrease\
  \ sensitivity and increase performance. Recommended values are 12 or 16 for smaller\
  \ organisms (bacteria) and 32 for larger organisms (chromosomes). These values must\
  \ be multiples of 4.\n\n ====\n"
