  \nName:\n    agat_convert_sp_gff2bed.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script aims to\
  \ convert GTF/GXF file into bed file. It will convert\n    level2 feature from gff\
  \ (mRNA, transcripts) into bed feature. If level2\n    subfeatures selected (defaut:\
  \ exon) exist, they will be reported in the\n    block fields (9-12th colum in bed).\n\
  \n    Definintion of the bed format: # 1 chrom - The name of the chromosome\n  \
  \  (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671). # 2\n    chromStart\
  \ - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or\n    scaffold. The\
  \ first base in a chromosome is numbered 0. # 3 chromEnd -\n    The ending position\
  \ of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The\n    chromEnd base is not included\
  \ in the display of the feature. For\n    example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome\
  \ are defined as\n    chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.\
  \ ##########\n    OPTIONAL fields ########## # 4 name - Defines the name of the\
  \ BED line.\n    This label is displayed to the left of the BED line in the Genome\n\
  \    Browser window when the track is open to full display mode or directly\n  \
  \  to the left of the item in pack mode. # 5 score - A score between 0 and\n   \
  \ 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this\n    annotation\
  \ data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in\n    which this\
  \ feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray). # 6\n    strand - Defines\
  \ the strand - either '+' or '-'. # 7 thickStart - The\n    starting position at\
  \ which the feature is drawn thickly # 8 thickEnd -\n    The ending position at\
  \ which the feature is drawn thickly # 9 itemRgb -\n    An RGB value of the form\
  \ R,G,B (e.g. 255,0,0). If the track line itemRgb\n    attribute is set to \"On\"\
  , this RBG value will determine the display\n    color of the data contained in\
  \ this BED line. NOTE: It is recommended\n    that a simple color scheme (eight\
  \ colors or less) be used with this\n    attribute to avoid overwhelming the color\
  \ resources of the Genome\n    Browser and your Internet browser. # 10 blockCount\
  \ - The number of\n    blocks (exons) in the BED line. # 11 blockSizes - A comma-separated\
  \ list\n    of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond\n\
  \    to blockCount. # 12 blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block\n    starts.\
  \ All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to\n    chromStart.\
  \ The number of items in this list should correspond to\n    blockCount.\n\nUsage:\n\
