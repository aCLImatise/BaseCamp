  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_presence.pl\n\nDescription:\n\
  \    The script aims to filter features according to attribute presence (9th\n \
  \   column). If the attribute exists, the feature is discarded. Attribute\n    are\
  \ stored in the 9th column and have this shape: tag=value /!\\ Removing\n    a level1\
  \ or level2 feature will automatically remove all linked\n    subfeatures, and removing\
  \ all children of a feature will automatically\n    remove this feature too.\n\n\
  Usage:\n        ./agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_presence.pl -f infile.gff\
  \ -a <tag> [ --output outfile ]\n        ./agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_presence.pl\
