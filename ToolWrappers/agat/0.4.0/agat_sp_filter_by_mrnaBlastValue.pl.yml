  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_filter_by_mrnaBlastValue.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ aims to remove from a gff file all the sequence that have a\n    similarity over\
  \ THRESHOLD with another sequence (will keep only one).\n    This is typically useful\
  \ when creating a list of mRNA to use to train\n    abinitio gene finder. A reciprocal\
  \ blast of the sequences need to have\n    been performed prior to the use of this\
  \ script in order to get the\n    blastp input file.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_filter_by_mrnaBlastValue.pl\
  \ --gff infile.gff --blast blastfile --outfile outFile\n        agat_sp_filter_by_mrnaBlastValue.pl\
  \ --help\n\nOptions:\n    --gff   Input GTF/GFF file.\n\n    --blast The list of\
  \ the all-vs-all blast file (outfmt 6, blastp)\n\n    --outfile\n            The\
  \ name of the output file. By default the output is the\n            standard output.\n\
