  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_kraken_assess_lift_coverage.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ takes as input gtf produced by Kraken (lift-over tool). It\n    will analyse the\
  \ kraken_mapped attributes to calculate the mapped\n    percentage of each mRNA.\
  \ According to a threshold (0 by default), gene\n    with a mapping percentage over\
  \ that value will be reported. A plot\n    nammed geneMapped_plot.pdf is performed\
  \ to visualize the result. /!\\ The\n    script handles chimeric files (i.e containg\
  \ gene part mapped on the\n    template genome and others on the de-novo one) /!\\\
  /!\\ If the file is\n    complete (containing kraken_mapped=\"TRUE\" and kraken_mapped=\"\
  FALSE\"\n    attributes), the script calcul the real percentage lentgh that has\
  \ been\n    mapped. Else the calcul is only based on feature with\n    kraken_mapped=\"\
  TRUE\" attributes. So in this case the result most of time\n    will be 100%. /!\\\
  /!\\/!\\ We met rare cases where Kraken mapped a feature\n    to several locations\
  \ of the de-novo genome. As result we could end up\n    with mapping over > 100%.\
  \ We report them as 100% mapped in the plot and\n    a warning is raised to allow\
  \ to check thoses cases.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_kraken_assess_lift_coverage\
