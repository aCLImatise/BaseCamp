  \nUsage: fastaptamer_cluster [-h] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE] [-d #] [-f #] [-q] [-v]\n\
  \n    [-h]            = Help screen.\n    [-i INFILE]     = Input file from FASTAptamer-Count.\
  \ REQUIRED.\n    [-o OUTFILE]    = Output file, FASTA format. REQUIRED.\n    [-d]\
  \            = Edit distance for clustering sequences. REQUIRED.\n    [-f]     \
  \       = Read filter. Only sequences with total reads greater than\n          \
  \            the value supplied will be clustered.\n    [-c]            = Maximum\
  \ number of clusters to find.\n    [-q]            = Quiet mode.  Suppresses standard\
  \ output of file I/O, numb-\n                      er of clusters, cluster size\
  \ and execution time.\n    [-v]            = Display version.\n\nFASTAptamer-Cluster\
  \ uses the Levenshtein algorithm to cluster together sequences\nbased on a user-defined\
  \ edit distance.  The most abundant and unclustered seque-\nnce is used as the \"\
  seed sequence\" for which edit distance is calculated from.  \nOutput is FASTA with\
  \ the following information on the identifier line for each \nsequence entry:\n\n\
  \    >Rank-Reads-RPM-Cluster#-RankWithinCluster-EditDistanceFromSeed\n    SEQUENCE\n\
  \nTo prevent clustering of sequences not highly sampled (and improve execution ti-\n\
  me), invoke the read filter and enter a number.  Only sequences with total reads\n\
  greater than the number entered will be clustered. \n\nInput for FASTAptamer-Cluster\
  \ MUST come from a FASTAptamer-Count output file. \n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a computationally\
  \ intense program that can take multiple h-\nours to finish depending on the size\
  \ and complexity of your population. Utilize\nthe read filter [-f] and/or the maximum\
  \ number of clusters [-c] to improve ex-\necution time. \n\n"
