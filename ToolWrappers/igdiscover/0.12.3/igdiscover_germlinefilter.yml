  \ performed on each candidate\nseparately:\n\n* Discard sequences with N bases\n\
  * Discard sequences that come from a consensus over too few source sequences (unless\
  \ whitelisted)\n* Discard sequences with too few unique CDR3s (CDR3_clusters column)\n\
  * Discard sequences with too few unique Js (Js_exact column)\n* Discard sequences\
  \ identical to one of the database sequences (if DB given)\n* Discard sequences\
  \ that contain a stop codon (has_stop column) (unless whitelisted)\n\nThe following\
  \ criteria involve comparison of candidates against each other:\n\n* Discard sequences\
  \ that are identical (unless whitelisted)\n* Discard sequences that are cross-mapping\
  \ artifacts\n* Discard sequences that have a too low allele ratio\n* Discard sequences\
  \ with too few unique Ds relative to other alleles (Ds_exact column)\n\nIf you provide\
  \ a whitelist of sequences, then the candidates that appear on it\n* are not checked\
  \ for the cluster size criterion,\n* are never considered near-duplicates,\n* are\
