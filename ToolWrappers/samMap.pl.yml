  \ against an exon-exon junction file back to genome level\n\nUsage: /usr/local/bin/samMap.pl\
  \ exex.sam map.psl [flank] > out.sam\n\nexex.sam was created e.g. with GSNAP in\
  \ the following way:\ngmap_build -d exex_db exex.fa\ngsnap --format=sam --nofails\
  \ -d exex_db rnaseq.fastq > exex.sam\n\nmap.psl was created in the following way:\n\
  intron2exex.pl --introns=introns.lst --seq=genome.masked.fa --exex=exex.fa --map=map.psl\n\
  \nPlease note that mapSam.pl assumes that the flanking region of introns is 75+75\
  \ bp! Specify other value if needed.\n"
