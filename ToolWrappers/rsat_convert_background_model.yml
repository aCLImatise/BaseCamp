  \    Interconversions between formats of background models supported by\n    different\
  \ programs (oligo-analysis, dyad-analysis, matrix-scan, patser,\n    consensus,\
  \ MotifLocator, MotifSampler, MEME, ...).\n\n    Background models can be automatically\
  \ loaded from the RSAT collection\n    of pre-calculated background models.\n\n\
  \    This is a temporary version, with only some formats supported.\n    Additional\
  \ formats will be progressively added.\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n    Jacques van Helden\

  \ [-v]\n\n\e[1mBACKGROUND MODEL FORMATS\e[0m\n    \e[1mNote\e[0m: some formats are\
  \ supported for both input and output, but some\n    formats are supported only\
  \ for input or for output.\n\n  \e[1moligos (input/output)\e[0m\n    Oligonucleotide\
  \ frequency table, as exported by the RSAT program\n    \e[33moligo-analysis\e[0m.\n\
  \n    An oligo file containing k-mers frequencies corresponds to a Markov\n    model\
  \ of order \e[33mm=k-1\e[0m. Frequencies are converted to transition\n    probabilities\
  \ by calculating the relative frequencies of all oligomers\n    of size k having\
  \ the same prefix (first m letters).\n\n    The oligo frequency table have one row\
  \ per oligonucleotide. Columns\n    indicate respectively:\n\n     1. oligo sequence\n\
  \     2. oligo ID (single ID for single strand models, ID|RC for two-strands models)\n\
  \     3. frequency (probablity to find the oligo at a giben sequence position)\n\
  \     4. occurrences (total number of occurrences in the training set)\n\n    Additional\
  \ columns are ignored.\n\n    Oligo frequency files are generated using either \e\
  [33mcount-words\e[0m or\n    \e[33moligo-analysis -return occ,freq\e[0m.\n\n  \e\
  [1mdyads (input)\e[0m\n    Oligonucleotide frequency table, as exported by the RSAT\
  \ program\n    \e[33mdyad-analysis\e[0m. Dyads with spacing 0 are converted to oligos,\
  \ and\n    frequencies are converted into transition probabilities as for the\n\
  \    format \"oligos\".\n\n  \e[1mMotifSampler (input/output)\e[0m\n    Also called\
  \ \e[33minclusive\e[0m or \e[33mms\e[0m.\n\n    This format can be used by the various\
  \ programs of the software suite\n    INCLUSive developed by Gert Thijs\n    (http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~thijs/download.html).\n\
  \n    MotifSampler background files can be generated with the program\n    \e[33mCreateBackgroundModel\e\
  [0m, which creates a Markov model from a background\n    sequence.\n\n  \e[1mMEME\
  \ (input/output)\e[0m\n    MEME (http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/) is a matrix-based motif\
  \ discovery\n    program developed by Tim Bailey, and supporting Marckov chain background\n\
  \    models.\n\n    MEME background files can be generated with the program\n  \
  \  \e[33mfasta-get-markov\e[0m, which creates a Markov model from a background\n\
  \    sequence.\n\n  \e[1mpatser (output)\e[0m\n    Export the Markov model in patser\
  \ format. \e[33mpatser\e[0m isa pattern matching\n    program developed by Jerry\
  \ Hertz.\n\n    WARNING: patser only supports Bernoulli models ! If the Markov order\
  \ is\n    superior to 0, this function issues a fatal error.\n\n  \e[1mtransitions\
  \ (output)\e[0m\n    Transition table with one row per prefix, one column per suffix,\
  \ each\n    cell indicating the transition frequency.\n\n  \e[1mtables (output)\e\
  [0m\n    Export tables with various statistics: - oligo frequencies\n\n     - frequencies:\
  \ oligomer frequencies, presented in a\n       prefix/suffix table\n\n      - relative\
  \ frequencies: relative oligomer frequencies. These differ\n        from the raw\
  \ frequencies only i the input file contained\n        non-normalized frequencies\
  \ (e.g. pattern occurrences).\n\n      - transition frequencies: see the format\
  \ \"transitions\" above.\n\n    This output is convenient for understanding the\
  \ different steps for the\n    conversion between oligomer frequencies (oligomer\
  \ length k=m+1) and\n    transition tables.\n\n\e[1mOPTIONS\e[0m\n    \e[1m-v #\e\
