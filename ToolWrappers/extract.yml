help_text: "USAGE:  extract [options] <sequence-file> <coords>\n\nRead fasta-format\
  \ <sequence-file> and extract from it the\nsubsequences specified by <coords>. \
  \ By default, <coords>\nis the name of a file containing lines of the form\n  <tag>\
  \  <start>  <stop>  [<frame>] ...\nCoordinates are inclusive counting from 1, e.g.,\
  \ \"1 3\"\nrepresents the 1st 3 characters of the sequence.\nFor each line the corresponding\
  \ region of <sequence-file>\nis extracted and output (after reverse-complementing\
  \ if necessary)\nOutput goes to stdout in multi-fasta format, unless the -2 option\n\
  is specified\n\nOptions:\n -2\n --2_fields\n    Output each sequence as 2 fields\
  \ (tag and sequence) on a single line\n -d\n --dir\n    Use the 4th column of each\
  \ input line to specify the direction\n    of the sequence.  Positive is forward,\
  \ negative is reverse\n    The input sequence is assumed to be circular\n -h\n --help\n\
  \    Print this message\n -l <n>\n --minlen <n>\n    Don't output any sequence shorter\
  \ than <n> characters\n -s\n --nostart\n    Omit the first 3 characters of each\
  \ output string\n -t\n --nostop\n    Omit the last 3 characters of each output string\n\
  \ -w\n --nowrap\n    Use the actual input coordinates without any wraparound\n \
  \   that would be needed by a circular genome.  Without this\n    option, the output\
  \ sequence is the shorter of the two ways\n    around the circle.  Use the -d option\
  \ to specify direction\n    explicitly.\n\n"
