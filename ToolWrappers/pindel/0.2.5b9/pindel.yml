  \   pindel (detection of indels and structural variations)\nPindel version 0.2.5b9,\
  \ 20160729.\nContact:   Kai Ye <kaiye@xjtu.edu.cn>\n\nUsage:     pindel -f <reference.fa>\
  \ -p <pindel_input>\n           [and/or -i bam_configuration_file]\n           -c\
  \ <chromosome_name> -o <prefix_for_output_file>\n\nRequired parameters:\n      \
  \     -f/--fasta\n           the reference genome sequences in fasta format \n\n\
  \           -p/--pindel-file\n           the Pindel input file; either this, a pindel\
  \ configuration file \n           (consisting of multiple pindel filenames) or a\
  \ bam configuration file \n           is required \n\n           -i/--config-file\n\
  \           the bam config file; either this, a pindel input file, or a pindel \n\
  \           config file is required. Per line: path and file name of bam, insert\
  \ \n           size and sample tag.     For example: /data/tumour.bam  400  tumour\
  \ \n\n           -o/--output-prefix\n           Output prefix; \n\n\nOptional parameters:\n\
  \           -P/--pindel-config-file\n           the pindel config file, containing\
  \ the names of all Pindel files that \n           need to be sampled; either this,\
  \ a bam config file or a pindel input \n           file is required. Per line: path\
  \ and file name of pindel input. \n           Example: /data/tumour.txt \n\n   \
  \        -c/--chromosome\n           Which chr/fragment. Pindel will process reads\
  \ for one chromosome each \n           time. ChrName must be the same as in reference\
  \ sequence and in read \n           file. '-c ALL' will make Pindel loop over all\
  \ chromosomes. The search \n           for indels and SVs can also be limited to\
  \ a specific region; -c \n           20:10,000,000 will only look for indels and\
  \ SVs after position \n           10,000,000 = [10M, end], -c 20:5,000,000-15,000,000\
  \ will report \n           indels in the range between and including the bases at\
  \ position \n           5,000,000 and 15,000,000 = [5M, 15M]. (default ALL) \n\n\
  \           -h/--help\n           show the command line options of Pindel \n\n \
  \          -R/--RP\n           search for discordant read-pair to improve sensitivity\
  \ (default true) \n\n           -H/--min_distance_to_the_end\n           the minimum\
  \ number of bases required to match reference (default 8). \n\n           -T/--number_of_threads\n\
  \           the number of threads Pindel will use (default 1). \n\n           -x/--max_range_index\n\
  \           the maximum size of structural variations to be detected; the higher\
  \ \n           this number, the greater the number of SVs reported, but the \n \
  \          computational cost and memory requirements increase, as does the rate\
  \ \n           of false positives. 1=128, 2=512, 3=2,048, 4=8,092, 5=32,368, \n\
  \           6=129,472, 7=517,888, 8=2,071,552, 9=8,286,208. (maximum 9, default\
  \ \n           2) \n\n           -w/--window_size\n           for saving RAM, divides\
  \ the reference in bins of X million bases and \n           only analyzes the reads\
  \ that belong in the current bin, (default 5 \n           (=5 million)) \n\n   \
  \        -e/--sequencing_error_rate\n           the expected fraction of sequencing\
  \ errors (default 0.01) \n\n           -E/--sensitivity\n           Pindel only\
  \ reports reads if they can be fit around an event within a \n           certain\
  \ number of mismatches. If the fraction of sequencing errors is \n           0.01,\
  \ (so we'd expect a total error rate of 0.011 since on average 1 \n           in\
  \ 1000 bases is a SNP) and pindel calls a deletion, but there are 4 \n         \
  \  mismatched bases in the new fit of the pindel read (100 bases) to the \n    \
  \       reference genome, Pindel would calculate that with an error rate of \n \
  \          0.01 (=0.011 including SNPs) the chance that there are 0, 1 or 2 \n \
  \          mismatched bases in the reference genome is 90%. Setting -E to .90 \n\
  \           (=90%) will thereforethrow away all reads with 3 or more mismatches,\
  \ \n           even though that means that you throw away 1 in 10 valid reads. \n\
  \           Increasing this parameter to say 0.99 will increase the sensitivity\
  \ \n           of pindel though you may get more false positives, decreasing the\
  \ \n           parameter ensures you only get very good matches but pindel may not\
  \ \n           find as many events. (default 0.95) \n\n           -u/--maximum_allowed_mismatch_rate\n\
  \           Only reads with more than this fraction of mismatches than the \n  \
  \         reference genome will be considered as harboring potential SVs. \n   \
  \        (default 0.02) \n\n           -n/--NM\n           the minimum number of\
  \ edit distance between reads and reference \n           genome (default 2). reads\
  \ at least NM edit distance (>= NM) will be \n           realigned \n\n        \
  \   -r/--report_inversions\n           report inversions (default true) \n\n   \
  \        -t/--report_duplications\n           report tandem duplications (default\
  \ true) \n\n           -l/--report_long_insertions\n           report insertions\
  \ of which the full sequence cannot be deduced \n           because of their length\
  \ (default false) \n\n           -k/--report_breakpoints\n           report breakpoints\
  \ (default false) \n\n           -s/--report_close_mapped_reads\n           report\
  \ reads of which only one end (the one closest to the mapped \n           read of\
  \ the paired-end read) could be mapped. (default false) \n\n           -S/--report_only_close_mapped_reads\n\
  \           do not search for SVs, only report reads of which only one end (the\
  \ \n           one closest to the mapped read of the paired-end read) could be \n\
  \           mapped (the output file can then be used as an input file for another\
  \ \n           run of pindel, which may save size if you need to transfer files).\
  \ \n           (default false) \n\n           -I/--report_interchromosomal_events\n\
  \           search for interchromosomal events. Note: will require the computer\
  \ \n           to have at least 4 GB of memory (default false) \n\n           -C/--IndelCorrection\n\
  \           search for consensus indels to corret contigs (default false) \n\n \
  \          -N/--NormalSamples\n           Turn on germline filtering, less sensistive\
  \ and you may miss somatic \n           calls (default false) \n\n           -b/--breakdancer\n\
  \           Pindel is able to use calls from other SV methods such as BreakDancer\
  \ \n           to further increase sensitivity and specificity.                \
  \    \n           BreakDancer result or calls from any methods must in the format:\
  \   \n           ChrA LocA stringA ChrB LocB stringB other \n\n           -j/--include\n\
  \           If you want Pindel to process a set of regions, please provide a bed\
  \ \n           file here: chr start end \n\n           -J/--exclude\n          \
  \ If you want Pindel to skip a set of regions, please provide a bed \n         \
  \  file here: chr start end \n\n           -a/--additional_mismatch\n          \
  \ Pindel will only map part of a read to the reference genome if there \n      \
  \     are no other candidate positions with no more than the specified \n      \
  \     number of mismatches position. The bigger the value, the more \n         \
  \  accurate but less sensitive. (minimum value 1, default value 1) \n\n        \
  \   -m/--min_perfect_match_around_BP\n           at the point where the read is\
  \ split into two, there should at least \n           be this number of perfectly\
  \ matching bases between read and reference \n           (default value 3) \n\n\
  \           -v/--min_inversion_size\n           only report inversions greater than\
  \ this number of bases (default 50) \n\n           -d/--min_num_matched_bases\n\
  \           only consider reads as evidence if they map with more than X bases to\
  \ \n           the reference. (default 30) \n\n           -B/--balance_cutoff\n\
  \           the number of bases of a SV above which a more stringent filter is \n\
  \           applied which demands that both sides of the SV are mapped with \n \
  \          sufficiently long strings of bases (default 100) \n\n           -A/--anchor_quality\n\
  \           the minimal mapping quality of the reads Pindel uses as anchor If you\
  \ \n           only need high confident calls, set to 30 or higher(default 0) \n\
  \n           -M/--minimum_support_for_event\n           Pindel only calls events\
  \ which have this number or more supporting \n           reads (default 1) \n\n\
  \           -z/--input_SV_Calls_for_assembly\n           A filename of a list of\
  \ SV calls for assembling breakpoints \n            Types: DEL, INS, DUP, INV, CTX\
  \ and ITX \n            File format: Type chrA posA Confidence_Range_A chrB posB\
  \ \n           Confidence_Range_B \n            Example: DEL chr1 10000 50 chr2\
  \ 20000 100 \n\n           -g/--genotyping\n           gentype variants if -i is\
  \ also used. \n\n           -Q/--output_of_breakdancer_events\n           If breakdancer\
  \ input is used, you can specify a filename here to \n           write the confirmed\
  \ breakdancer events with their exact breakpoints \n           to The list of BreakDancer\
  \ calls with Pindel support information. \n           Format: chr   Loc_left   Loc_right\
  \   size   type   index.             \n           For example, \"1\t72766323 \t\
  72811840 \t45516\tD\t11970\" means the deletion \n           event chr1:72766323-72811840\
  \ of size 45516 is reported as an event \n           with index 11970 in Pindel\
  \ report of deletion. \n\n           -L/--name_of_logfile\n           Specifies\
  \ a file to write Pindel's log to (default: no logfile, log \n           is written\
