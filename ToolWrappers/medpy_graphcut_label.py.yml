  \ max-flow/min-cut algorithm.\n                  \n                  This implementation\
  \ does only compute a boundary term and does not use\n                  any regional\
  \ term. The desired boundary term can be selected via the\n                  --boundary\
  \ argument. Depending on the selected term, an additional\n                  image\
  \ has to be supplied as badditional.\n                  \n                  In the\
  \ case of the stawiaski boundary term, this is the gradient image.\n           \
  \       In the case of the difference of means, it is the original image.\n    \
  \              \n                  Furthermore the algorithm requires the region\
  \ map of the original\n                  image and an integer image with foreground\
  \ and background markers.\n                  \n                  Additionally a\
  \ filename for the created binary mask marking foreground\n                  and\
  \ background has to be supplied.\n                  \n                  Note that\
  \ the input images must be of the same dimensionality,\n                  otherwise\
  \ an exception is thrown.\n                  Note to take into account the input\
  \ images orientation.\n                  Note that the quality of the resulting\
  \ segmentations depends also on\n                  the quality of the supplied markers.\n\
