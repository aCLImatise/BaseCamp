  \nINPUT_BAM=File                The input BAM.  Required. \n\nINPUT_VCF=File   \
  \             The input VCF.  Required. \n\nSAMPLE_FILE=File              A file\
  \ containing a list of samples to filter the VCF by.  Has 1 column, 1 entry per\
  \ row. \n                              Each entry is a single sample name from the\
  \ VCF.  Required. \n\nALLELE_FREQ_TAG=String        An INFO tag variants that indicates\
  \ the allele frequency.  If this is specified, use this\n                      \
  \        expected allele frequency for the variant instead of generating one based\
  \ on the donors in\n                              the VCF not in the SAMPLE_FILE.\
  \  Default value: null. \n\nOUTPUT=File\nO=File                        The output\
  \ file containing the summarized contamination rate of the experiment.  Required.\n\
  \nOUTPUT_VERBOSE=File           Output of each SNP record in the data set that passes\
  \ filters at the VCF level and has at\n                              least 1 read\

  \                              pass other filter criteria.  Default value: null.\
  \ \n\nMINIMUM_MAF=Double            The minimum minor allele frequency in the general\
  \ population for a SNP to be considered in\n                              the summary.\
  \  Default value: 0.025. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default\n\
  \                              value. \n\nGQ_THRESHOLD=Integer          The minimum\
  \ genotype quality for a variant.  If VCF file has no genotype quality, this\n \
  \                             will be set to -1 to disable filtering.  Default value:\
  \ 30. This option can be set to\n                              'null' to clear the\
  \ default value. \n\nFRACTION_SAMPLES_PASSING=Double\n                         \
  \     At least  samples must have genotype scores >= GQ_THRESHOLD for the variant\
  \ in the VCF to\n                              be included in the analysis.  Default\
  \ value: 0.9. This option can be set to 'null' to\n                            \
  \  clear the default value. \n\nIGNORED_CHROMOSOMES=String    A list of chromosomes\
  \ to omit from the analysis.  The default is to omit the sex\n                 \
  \             chromosomes.  Default value: [X, Y, MT]. This option can be set to\
  \ 'null' to clear the\n                              default value. This option\
  \ may be specified 0 or more times. This option can be set to\n                \
  \              'null' to clear the default list. \n\nREAD_MQ=Integer           \
  \    The map quality of the read to be included.  Default value: 10. This option\
  \ can be set to\n                              'null' to clear the default value.\
  \ \n\nMIN_BASE_QUALITY=Integer      The minimum base quality of the SNP base on\
  \ the read  Default value: 10. This option can\n                              be\
  \ set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nSEQUENCING_ERROR_RATE=Double  The\
  \ estimated sequencing error rate  Default value: 0.001. This option can be set\
  \ to\n                              'null' to clear the default value. \n\nKNOWN_DONOR_TAG=String\
  \        This option is intended to make evaluation of the algorithm easier when\
  \ supplied proper\n                              training data.  When tagging reads\
  \ from known donors with the KNOWN_DONOR_TAG and\n                             \
  \ synthetically mixing them to evalutate the algorithm, this counts the number of\
  \ reads\n                              observed with the tag per donor.  Non-informative\
  \ reads (low map quality, PCR duplicates)\n                              are not\
  \ counted. Reads are only counted on contigs for which there is at least one SNP\n\
  \                              present in the VCF (minus IGNORED_CHROMOSOES that\
  \ are ignored) that could inform the data.\n                              This tends\
  \ to exclude bait contigs and alternative haplotypes.The final contamination rate\n\
  \                              is based on the number of reads that originate from\
  \ either reads that are not labeled with\n                              this tag,\
  \ plus any reads that come from donors in the EXCLUDE_KNOWN_DONOR list.For\n   \
  \                           example, if there were 40 donors in the BAM file and\
  \ all reads were tagged with their\n                              donor of origin\
  \ via this tag, and the EXCLUDE_KNOWN_DONOR was set to DONOR_A, the fraction\n \
  \                             of reads from DONOR_A in the input should be estimated\
  \ by the output contaimination rate. \n                              Default value:\
  \ null. \n\nEXCLUDE_KNOWN_DONOR=String    Exclude one or more KNOWN donors from\
  \ the calculation of contamination rate.  This removes\n                       \
  \       those donors from the SAMPLE_FILE, and counts the fraction of reads thesedonors\
  \ contain in\n                              the data set as the contamination rate.\
  \  Default value: null. This option may be specified\n                         \
  \     0 or more times. \n\n"
