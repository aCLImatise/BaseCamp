  \ be specified at least 1 times. \n\nOUTPUT=File\nO=File                       \
  \ Output BAM file with an extra tag.  Required. \n\nPRIMARY_BARCODE=String     \
  \   Barcode to collapse  Required. \n\nEDIT_DISTANCE=Integer         The edit distance\
  \ to collapse barcodes  Default value: 1. This option can be set to 'null'\n   \
  \                           to clear the default value. \n\nFIND_INDELS=Boolean\
  \           Should indels be considered in edit distance calculations?  Doing this\
  \ correctly is far\n                              slower than a simple edit distance\
  \ test, but gives a more complete result.  Default value:\n                    \
  \          true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible\
  \ values: {true,\n                              false} \n\nOUT_BARCODE=String  \
  \          The output barcode tag for the newly collapsed barcodes  Required. \n\
  \nMINIMUM_MAPPING_QUALITY=Integer\nREAD_MQ=Integer               Minimum mapping\
  \ quality to include the read in the analysis.  Set to 0 to not filter reads\n \
  \                             by map quality.  Default value: 10. This option can\
  \ be set to 'null' to clear the default\n                              value. \n\
  \nMIN_NUM_READS_CORE=Integer    Number of reads a barcode would need to have in\
  \ order to have other barcodes get merged\n                              into it.\
  \  All barcodes are candidates to be merged into another barcode.For cell barcodes\n\
  \                              you probably want to set this to a relatively high\
  \ number like 100, since we expect cells\n                              to have\
  \ thousands or more reads, and this signficantly speeds up analysis.  For molecular\n\
  \                              barcodes, you probably want to set this to 1, as\
  \ you want to include all molecular\n                              barcodes, unless\
  \ you have very high sequencing depth.  Default value: null. \n\nNUM_CORE_BARCODES=Integer\
  \     Number of cells that you think are in the library.  This accomplishes the\
  \ same goals as\n                              the MIN_NUM_READS_CORE argument,\
  \ but instead of defining barcodes as important based on\n                     \
  \         the number of reads, it picks the top  barcodes as core.  Default value:\
  \ null. \n\nMIN_NUM_READS_NONCORE=Integer The number of reads a non-core barcode\
  \ must have to be merged with a core barcode. \n                              Default\
  \ value: 1. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nFILTER_PCR_DUPLICATES=Boolean\
  \ Filter PCR Duplicates.  Defaults to false  Default value: false. This option can\
  \ be set to\n                              'null' to clear the default value. Possible\
  \ values: {true, false} \n\nNUM_THREADS=Integer           Number of threads to use.\
  \  Defaults to 1.  Default value: 1. This option can be set to\n               \
  \               'null' to clear the default value. \n\n"
