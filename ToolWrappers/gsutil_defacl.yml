help_text: "NAME\n  defacl - Get, set, or change default ACL on buckets\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\
  \  gsutil defacl set file-or-canned_acl_name url...\n  gsutil defacl get url\n \
  \ gsutil defacl ch [-f] -u|-g|-d|-p <grant>... url...\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The\
  \ defacl command has three sub-commands:\n\nSET\n  The \"defacl set\" command sets\
  \ default object ACLs for the specified buckets.\n  If you specify a default object\
  \ ACL for a certain bucket, Google Cloud\n  Storage applies the default object ACL\
  \ to all new objects uploaded to that\n  bucket, unless an ACL for that object is\
  \ separately specified during upload.\n\n  Similar to the \"acl set\" command, the\
  \ file-or-canned_acl_name names either a\n  canned ACL or the path to a file that\
  \ contains ACL text. (See \"gsutil\n  help acl\" for examples of editing and setting\
  \ ACLs via the\n  acl command.)\n\n  Setting a default object ACL on a bucket provides\
  \ a convenient way to ensure\n  newly uploaded objects have a specific ACL. If you\
  \ don't set the bucket's\n  default object ACL, it will default to project-private.\
  \ If you then upload\n  objects that need a different ACL, you will need to perform\
  \ a separate ACL\n  update operation for each object. Depending on how many objects\
  \ require\n  updates, this could be very time-consuming.\n\nGET\n  Gets the default\
  \ ACL text for a bucket, which you can save and edit\n  for use with the \"defacl\
  \ set\" command.\n\nCH\n  The \"defacl ch\" (or \"defacl change\") command updates\
  \ the default object\n  access control list for a bucket. The syntax is shared with\
  \ the \"acl ch\"\n  command, so see the \"CH\" section of \"gsutil help acl\" for\
  \ the full help\n  description.\n\nCH EXAMPLES\n  Grant anyone on the internet READ\
  \ access by default to any object created\n  in the bucket example-bucket:\n\n \
  \   gsutil defacl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://example-bucket\n\n  NOTE: By default, publicly\
  \ readable objects are served with a Cache-Control\n  header allowing such objects\
  \ to be cached for 3600 seconds. If you need to\n  ensure that updates become visible\
  \ immediately, you should set a\n  Cache-Control header of \"Cache-Control:private,\
  \ max-age=0, no-transform\" on\n  such objects. For help doing this, see \"gsutil\
  \ help setmeta\".\n\n  Add the user john.doe@example.com to the default object ACL\
  \ on bucket\n  example-bucket with READ access:\n\n    gsutil defacl ch -u john.doe@example.com:READ\
  \ gs://example-bucket\n\n  Add the group admins@example.com to the default object\
  \ ACL on bucket\n  example-bucket with OWNER access:\n\n    gsutil defacl ch -g\
  \ admins@example.com:O gs://example-bucket\n\n  Remove the group admins@example.com\
  \ from the default object ACL on bucket\n  example-bucket:\n\n    gsutil defacl\
  \ ch -d admins@example.com gs://example-bucket\n\n  Add the owners of project example-project-123\
  \ to the default object ACL on\n  bucket example-bucket with READ access:\n\n  \
  \  gsutil defacl ch -p owners-example-project-123:R gs://example-bucket\n\n  NOTE:\
  \ You can replace 'owners' with 'viewers' or 'editors' to grant access\n  to a project's\
  \ viewers/editors respectively.\n\nCH OPTIONS\n  The \"ch\" sub-command has the\
  \ following options\n\n    -d          Remove all roles associated with the matching\
  \ entity.\n\n    -f          Normally gsutil stops at the first error. The -f option\
  \ causes\n                it to continue when it encounters errors. With this option\
  \ the\n                gsutil exit status will be 0 even if some ACLs couldn't be\n\
  \                changed.\n\n    -g          Add or modify a group entity's role.\n\
  \n    -p          Add or modify a project viewers/editors/owners role.\n\n    -u\
  \          Add or modify a user entity's role.\n"
