    \ and SUB mutations with sizes ≤ 20 bp; and all INS and DEL mutations causing\
    \ expansion or contraction of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) with at least two\
    \ repeats of the same unit of one to several bp and a total length of 5 bp in\
    \ the reference genome. If these mutations are marked as 'mediated' or 'between'\
    \ repeats, then they are NOT removed."
