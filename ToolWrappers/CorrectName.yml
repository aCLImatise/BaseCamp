  Usage of CorrectName:\n** Required **\n<fa/fq>: RNA-seq data type.\n         If\
  \ it is stored by fasta format, please type fa\n         If it is stored by fastq\
  \ format, please type fq\n<Path to left reads>: Left RNA-seq reads.\n<Path to right\
  \ reads>: Right RNA-seq reads.\n<Path to name modified left reads>: Name modified\
  \ left reads.\n<Path to name modified right reads>: Name modified right reads.\n\
  \ \n** Note **\nIf fastq RNA-seq data: reads_1.fq and reads_2.fq need to process\n\
