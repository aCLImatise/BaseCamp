help_text: "\nUSAGE: maf_parse [OPTIONS] <infile>\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n    Reads a MAF\
  \ file and perform various operations on it.\n    Performs parsing operations block-by-block\
  \ whenever possible,\n    rather than storing entire alignment in memory.  \n  \
  \  Can extract a sub-alignment from an alignment (by row\n     or by column).  Can\
  \ extract features given GFF, BED, or \n    genepred file.  Can also extract sub-features\
  \ such as CDS1,2,3\n    or 4d sites.  Can perform various functions such as gap\n\
  \    stripping or re-ordering of sequences.  Capable of reading and\n    writing\
  \ in a few common formats, but will not load input or output\n    alignments into\
  \ memory if output format is MAF.\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n (Output format)\n    --out-format,\
  \ -o MAF|PHYLIP|FASTA|MPM|SS\n        (Default MAF).  Output file format.  SS format\
  \ is only\n        available un-ordered.  Note that some options, which involve\n\
  \        reversing alignments based on strand, or stripping gaps, \n        cannot\
  \ be output in MAF format and use FASTA by default.\n        Also note that when\
  \ output format is not MAF, the entire\n        output must be loaded into memory.\n\
  \n    --pretty, -p\n        Pretty-print alignment (use '.' when character matches\n\

  \ sequences.\n\n    --order, -O <name_list>\n        Change order of rows in alignment\

  \      Do not assume first sequence in MAF is refseq.  Instead, use\n        coordinates\

  \ into multiple MAFs by length)\n    --split, -S length \n        Split MAF into\
  \ pieces by length, and puts output in \n        outRootX.maf, where X=1,2,...,numPieces.\
  \  outRoot can be\n        modified with --out-root, and the minimum number of digits\
  \ in X\n        can be modified with --out-root-digits.\n        Splits between\
  \ blocks, so that each output file does not exceed\n        specified length.  By\
  \ default, length is counted by distance\n        spanned in alignment by refseq,\
