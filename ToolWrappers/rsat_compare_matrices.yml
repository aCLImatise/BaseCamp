  \ (under the\n    name Sandelin-Wasserman). This is a distance to similarity conversion\
  \ of\n    the SSD. The conversion is ensured by substracting each squared distance\n\
  \    to a constant 2 (the max distance between two columns containing\n    relative\
  \ frequencies, i.e. one residue has frequency 1 in one column,\n    and another\
  \ residue has ffrequency 1 in the other column).\n\n     SW = SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w}\

  \ dEucl = sqrt( SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} - f2{i,j})^2)\n\n    Since relative\
  \ frequencies can take values from 0 to 1, the Euclidian\n    distance can take\
  \ values from 0 to sqrt(2)*w.\n\n  \e[1mNormalized Euclidian distance (NdEucl)\e\
  [0m\n    Euclidian distance normalized by the number of aligned columns (\e[33mw\e\
  [0m).\n\n     NdEucl = dEucl / w\n\n    NdEucl can take values from 0 to sqrt(2).\n\
  \n    Note that this differs from the definition provided in Pape et al.\n    (2008).\n\
  \n  \e[1mNormalized Euclidian similarity (NsEucl)\e[0m\n    A similarity metrics\
  \ derived from the normalized Euclidian distance.\n\n     NsEucl = (Max(NdEucl)\
  \ - NdEucl) / Max(NdEucl)\n            = (sqrt(2) - NdEucl) / sqrt(2)\n\n    where\
  \ \e[33mMax(NdEucl)\e[0m=sqrt(2) is the maximal possible Euclidian distance for\n\
  \    the current pair of matrices. The Normalized Euclidian similarity can\n   \
  \ vary from 0 (idential matrices) to 1 (matrices with a single residue per\n   \
  \ column, and those residues systematically differ between the two\n    matrices).\n\
  \n  \e[1mKullback-Leibler distance (dKL)\e[0m\n    As defined in Aerts et al. (2003).\
  \ Also called \e[1mMutual Information\e[0m.\n\n     dKL = 1/(2w) * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w}\
  \ (\n                       f1{i,j}*log(f1{i,j}/f2{i,j})\n                     \
  \  + f2{i,j}*log(f2{i,j}/f1{i,j}))\n\n    Note that the KL distance is problematic\
  \ for matrices containing zero\n    values: for example, if f1(i,k)=0 and f2(i,j)=1,\
  \ we have : KL(i,j) =\n    (0*log(0) + 1*log(1/0)) = 0 + log(Inf) = Inf\n\n    One\
  \ can circumvent this problem by using pseudo-count corrected matrices\n    (f'(i,j)),\
  \ but then the KL distance is strongly dependent on the\n    somewhat arbitrary\
  \ choice of the pseudo-count value.\n\n  \e[1mCovariance (cov)\e[0m\n     cov =\
  \ 1/(r*w) * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} - f1m) * (f2{i,j} - f2m)\n\n    Beware\
  \ : this is the classical covariance defined in statistical\n    textbooks. It has\
  \ nothing to do with the \"natural covariance\" of Pape\n    (which still needs\
  \ to be implemented here). What we compute here is\n    simply the covariance between\
  \ the counts in the aligned cells of the\n    respective matrices.\n\n  \e[1mCoefficient\
  \ of correlation (cor)\e[0m\n     v1 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f1{i,j} -\
  \ f1m)^2\n     v2 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (f2{i,j} - f2m)^2\n     cor =\
  \ cov/ sqrt(v1*v2)\n\n  \e[1mNormalized correlation (Ncor, Ncor1, Ncor2, NcorS)\e\
  [0m\n    The normalized correlation prevents matches covering only a small\n   \
  \ fraction of the matrix (e.g. matches between the last column of the\n    query\
  \ matrix and the first column of the reference matrix, or matches of\n    a very\
  \ small motif against a large one).\n\n    The normalization factor is the relative\
  \ length (Wr), i.e. the number of\n    aligned columns divided by the total columns\
  \ of the alignment.\n\n    Ncor = cor * Wr\n\n    This correction is particularly\
  \ important to avoid selecting spurious\n    alignments between short fragments\
  \ of the flanks of the matrices (e.g.\n    single-column alignments). For this reasons,\
  \ \e[33mNcor\e[0m generally gives a\n    better estimation of motif similarity than\
  \ \e[33mcor\e[0m, and we recommend it as\n    similarity score.\n\n    Imposing\
  \ a too stringent lower threshold on Ncor may however reduce the\n    sensitivity,\
  \ and in particular prevent from detecting matches between\n    half-motifs (e.g.\
  \ in the case of dimeric transcription factor\n    recognizing composite motifs).\n\
  \n   Note\n    An alternative would be to use as normalizing factor the length of\
  \ the\n    alignment (w) relative to the length of the shorter motif.\n\n     Ncor\
  \ = cor * w / min(w1,w2)\n\n    This however tends to favour matches between very\
  \ short motifs (4-5\n    residues) which cover only a fraction of the query motif.\n\
  \n   Ncor1, Ncor2, NcorS\n    In addition to Ncor, we define separate normalized\
  \ correlations relative\n    to w1 and w2 resp.\n\n    Ncor1 = cor * w / w1\n  \
  \  Ncor2 = cor * w / w2\n    NcorS = cor * w / min(w1, w2)\n        Normalize the\
  \ correlation by the alignemnt width (w) relative to the\n        width of the smallest\
  \ of the two aligned matrices. This may return\n        more suitable results when\
  \ matrices of different sizes are aligned\n        (e.g. small motif included in\
  \ a composite motif), but sometimes the\n        sub-motifs will score better than\
  \ the full motifs.\n\n  \e[1mCorrelation of the information content (Icor)\e[0m\n\
  \    Pearson's correlation computed on the information content matrices (I1,\n \
  \   I2) rather than on the frequencies.\n\n     Icov = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w}\
  \ (I1{i,j} - f1m) * (I2{i,j} - f2m)\n     Iv1 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (I1{i,j}\
  \ - f1m)^2\n     Iv2 = 1/n * SUM{i=1->r} SUM{j=1->w} (I2{i,j} - f2m)^2\n     cor\
  \ = Icov/ sqrt(Iv1*Iv2)\n\n    The \e[33mIcor\e[0m score fixes a weakness of the\
  \ \e[33mcor\e[0m score and all other other\n    metrics above, which only take into\
  \ account the residue frequencies\n    whilst ignoring the background frequencies.\n\
  \n    A typical manifestation of this problem is that the \e[33mcor\e[0m score\n\
  \    occasionally returns alignements between non-informative pieces of the\n  \
  \  matrices , which appear flat on the aligned logos. The reason why\n    uninformative\
  \ columns may have a good correlation is that, if both\n    matrices have the same\
  \ compositional bias (for example 30%A, 20%C, 20%G\n    and 30%T), they will be\
  \ correlated. Consequently, the columns reflecting\n    the background will contribute\
  \ to increase the correlation coefficient.\n\n    The information content corrects\
  \ this bias by relativizing the matrix\n    frequencies with respect to the background\
  \ residue probaiblities.\n\n     I{i,j} = f{i,j} log (f{i,j}/p{j})\n\n    where\

  \n    \e[1m-skip X\e[0m\n        Skip the first X motifs of the input file(s).\n\
  \n        This combines the effect of -skip1 and -skip2.\n\n    \e[1m-o prefix\e\
  [0m\n        Prefix for the output files. The output prefix is mandatory for some\n\
  \        return fields (alignments, graphs, ...).\n\n        This prefix will be\
  \ appended with a series of suffixes for the\n        different output types (see\
  \ section OUTPUT FORMATS above for the\n        detail).\n\n    \e[1m-nobuf\e[0m\n\
  \        No buffering.\n\n        By default, the Perl language holds the output\
  \ in memory (buffering)\n        and writes output files piece by piece rather than\
  \ line by line.\n\n        This creates a particlar problem when \e[33mcompare-matrices\e\
  [0m is\n        encapsulated in another program (e.g. \e[33mpeak-footprints\e[0m),\
  \ beacause the\n        script occasionally exits while the bufer is still being\
  \ printed\n        out, and the output file is thus not yet ready for further analysis.\n\
  \n        The option -nobuf turns off buffering. The printing out is probably\n\
  \        slower (the output stream is printed at each match), so we maintain\n \
  \       buffering by default.\n\n    \e[1m-mode matches | scores | profiles | scan\
  \ \e[0m\n\n        \e[33m-mode matches\e[0m (default)\n            Return matches\
  \ between any matrix of the file1 and any matrix of\n            file2.\n\n    \
  \        This is the typical use of \e[33mcompare-matrices\e[0m: comparing one or\n\
  \            several query motifs (e.g. obtained from motif discovery) with a\n\
  \            collection of reference motifs (e.f. a database of\n            experimentally\
  \ characterized transcription factor binding\n            motifs, such as JASPAR,\
  \ TRANSFAC, RegulonDB, ...).\n\n            For a given pair of matrices (one from\
  \ file1 and one from\n            file2), the program tests all possible offsets,\
  \ and measures one\n            or several matching scores (see section \"(Dis)similarity\n\
  \            metrics\" above). The program only returns the score of the best\n\
  \            alignemnt between the two matrices. The \"best\" alignement is the\n\
  \            combination of offset and strand (with the option -strand DR)\n   \
  \         that maximizes the default score (Ncor). Alternative scores can\n    \
  \        be used as optimality criteria with the option -sort.\n\n        \e[33m-mode\
  \ scores\e[0m\n            Return scores of the best-matching alignment between\
  \ each matrix\n            pair.\n\n            This mode is used by \e[33mcluster-matrices\e\
  [0m in order to obtain a table\n            with pairwise comparison scores between\
  \ each pair of input\n            matrices. Since the hierarchical clustering requires\
  \ a table\n            with all scores defined, the score mode is incompatible with\
  \ the\n            options -uth and -lth.\n\n        \e[33m-mode profiles\e[0m\n\
  \            Return a table with one row for each possible alignment offset\n  \
  \          between two matrices, and various columns indicating the\n          \
  \  matching parameters (offset, strand, aligned width,...), the\n            matching\
  \ scores, and the consensus of the aligned columns of the\n            matrices.\n\
  \n            Matching profiles are convenient for drawing the similarity\n    \
  \        profiles, or for analyzing the correlations between various\n         \
  \   similarity metrics, but they are too verbosy for the typical use\n         \
  \   of \e[33mcompare-matrices\e[0m (detect matches between a query matrix and a\n\
  \            database of reference matrices). The formats \"matches\" and\n    \
  \        \"table\" are more convenient for basic use.\n\n        \e[33m-mode scan\e\
  [0m\n            Scan \e[33mreference matrices\e[0m with \e[33mquery matrices\e\
  [0m in order to identify\n            matching positons. This mode was designed\
  \ to identify regulatory\n            motifs in phylogenetically conserved blocks\
  \ resulting from\n            genome alignments (e.g. the multi-alignment files\
  \ from UCSC).\n            Multiple alignments can be converted to position-specific\n\
  \            matrices (conserved blocks), which can be used as reference\n     \
  \       matrices to be scanned with transcription factor binding motifs\n      \
  \      (query matrices).\n\n    \e[1m-distinct\e[0m\n        Skip comparison between\
  \ a matrix and itself.\n\n        This option is useful when the program is sused\
  \ to compare all\n        matrices of a given file to all matrices of the same file,\
  \ to avoid\n        comparing each matrix to itself.\n\n        Beware: the criterion\
  \ for considering two matrices identical is that\n        they have the same identifier.\
  \ If two matrices have exactly the same\n        content (in terms of occurrences\
  \ per position) but different\n        identifiers, they will be compared.\n\n \
  \   \e[1m-strand D | R | DR\e[0m\n        Perform matrix comparisons in direct (D)\
  \ reverse complementary (R)\n        or both orientations (DR, default option).\n\
  \n        When the R or DR options are activated, all matrices of the second\n \
  \       matrix file are converted to the reverse complementary matrix.\n\n     \
  \   This option is useful to answer very particular questions, for\n        example\n\
  \n        Comparing motifs in a strand-insensitive way (-strand DR)\n          \
  \  DNA-binding motifs are usually strand-insensitive. A motif may\n            be\
  \ detected in one given orientation by a motif-discovery\n            algorithm,\
  \ but annotated in the reverse complementary\n            orientation in a motif\
  \ database. For DNA binding motifs, we thus\n            recomment the DR option.\n\
  \n            On the contrary, RNA-related signals (termination,\n            poly-adenylation,\
  \ miRNA) are strand-sensitive, and should be\n            compared in a single orientation\
  \ (-strand D).\n\n        Detecting reverse complementary palindromic motifs\n \
  \           An example of reverse complementary palindromic motif is\n         \
  \   tCAGswwsGTGa. When a motif is reverse complementary palindromic,\n         \
  \   the matrix is correlated to its own reverse complement.\n\n            \e[33mRemark\
  \ about a frequent misconception of biological\n            palindromes\e[0m\n\n\
  \            Reverse complementary palindroms are frequent in DNA signals\n    \
  \        (e.g. transcription factor binding sites, restriction sites,\n        \
  \    ...) because they correspond to a rotational symmetry in the 3D\n         \
  \   structure. Such symmetrical motifs are often characteristic of\n           \
  \ sites recognized by homodimeric complexes.\n\n            By contrast, simple\
  \ string-based palindromes (e.g. CAGTTGAC) do\n            absolutely not correspond\
  \ to any symmetry on the biochemical\n            point of view, because the 3D\
  \ structure of the corresponding\n            double helix is not symmetrical. The\
  \ apparent symmetry is an\n            artifact of the string-based representation,\
  \ but the\n            corresponding molecule has neither rotational nor translational\n\
  \            symmetry.\n\n            DNA signals can either be symmetrical (reverse\
  \ complementary\n            palindromes, tandem repeats) or asymmetrical.\n\n \
