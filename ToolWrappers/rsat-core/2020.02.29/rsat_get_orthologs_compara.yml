  \   Returns orthologues, plus optionally paralogues and homeologues, for a\n   \
  \ set of genes in one or more organisms. Relies on primary data from\n    Ensembl\
  \ Compara.\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n    Bruno Contreras-Moreira <bcontreras\\@eead.csic.es>\n\
  \    Jacques van Helden <Jacques.van-Helden\\@univ-amu.fr>\n\n\e[1mCATEGORY\e[0m\n\
  \    comparative genomics\n\n\e[1mUSAGE\e[0m\n    get-orthologs-compara -q GENE1\
  \ -q GENE2 -ref_org organism_name [...]\n\n\e[1mHOMOLOGY CRITERIA\e[0m\n    Ensembl\
  \ Compara gene orthology and paralogy predictions are generated by\n    a pipeline\
  \ where maximum likelihood phylogenetic gene trees play a\n    central role. They\
  \ attempt to represent the evolutionary history of gene\n    families, i.e. genes\
  \ that diverged from a common ancestor. These gene\n    trees reconciled with their\
  \ species tree have their internal nodes\n    annotated to distinguish duplication\
  \ or speciation events, and thus\n    support the annotation of orthologous and\
  \ paralagous genes, which can be\n    part of complex one-to-many and many-to-many\
  \ relations.\n\n    Pairs of homologous sequences are scored in terms of % amino\
  \ acid\n    identity, which is calculated with respect to query and target in order\n\
  \    to capture length and possibly domain content differentes. For example,\n \
  \   if the species selected is Arabidopsis thaliana, and the homologue is in\n \
  \   maize, the query sequence is the A.thaliana protein and the target is\n    the\
  \ maize protein. \e[33mident_query\e[0m in this case is the % of the query\n   \
  \ identical to the maize protein, and \e[33mident_target\e[0m is the % of the maize\n\
  \    protein identical to the A.thaliana protein. These % identities will\n    only\
  \ be the same if the length (number of amino acids) of both sequences\n    are the\
  \ same.\n\n    [Adapted from:\n    <http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/homology_method.html>].\n\
  \n    This program queries a BerkeleyDB db of Ensembl Compara records, created\n\
  \    with \e[33mparse-compara\e[0m, which should be installed as\n    $RSAT/data/genomes/compara.dbd\
  \ .\n\n\e[1mINPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    Query genes can be directly entered on the command\
  \ line (option \e[33m-q\e[0m) or\n    in an input file (option \e[33m-i\e[0m). The\
  \ first word of each row of such a file\n    is handled as a gene. Any additional\
  \ information on the same row is\n    ignored.\n\n    As for genes, the reference\
  \ organisms can also be entered on the command\n    line (option \e[33m-ref_org\e\
  [0m) or in an input file (option \e[33m-org_list\e[0m).\n\n\e[1mOUTPUT FORMAT\e\
  [0m\n    A tab-separated file with seven columns. Each row of the output file\n\
  \    describes a homology relation between a query gene and a target gene.\n   \
  \ Output contains the following columns:\n\n    1. ID of target homologous gene\
  \ (Ensembl gene_stable_id).\n    2. Name of reference organism (of target gene).\n\
  \    3. type of homology relationship.\n    4. ID of the query gene.\n    5. Name\
  \ of query organism (of query gene).\n    6. % protein sequence identity with respect\
  \ to target length.\n    7. % protein sequence identity with respect to query length.\n\

  \ list of organisms supported for compara is a subset of those\n    installed in\

  \ \e[33m-supported_organisms\e[0m to get the relevant list of\n    organisms.\n\n\

  \    \e[1m-i inputfile\e[0m\n        If no input file is specified, the standard\

  \ organism\e[0m\n        Reports homologues of this reference organism.\n\n    \
  \    This option can be used iteratively to specify multiple reference\n       \
  \ organisms. An alternative is to use the option \e[33m-org_list\e[0m in order to\n\
  \        specify a file containing the list of reference organisms.\n\n    \e[1m-org_list\e\
  [0m\n        This option gives the posibility to specify a set of reference\n  \

  \ to that\n        file should be indicated.\n\n    \e[1m-supported_organisms\e\
  [0m\n        Lists supported organisms in local Compara database.\n\n        This\
  \ option is incompatible with the option \e[33mref_org\e[0m.\n\n        To obtain\

  \ be used iteratively on the same command to specify\n        multiple query genes.\n\
  \n        Alternatively, a list of query genes can be provided in a text file,\n\
  \        specified with the option \e[33m-i\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-query_org organism\e\
  [0m\n        Name of query organism.\n\n        This option allows to search homologues\
