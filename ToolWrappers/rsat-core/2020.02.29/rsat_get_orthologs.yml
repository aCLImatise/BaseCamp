  \ orthologs or paralogs for a set of gene of a given organism\n    (query organism)\
  \ in all organisms belonging to a given taxon (reference\n    taxon).\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e\
  [0m\n    Rekin's Janky <Rekins.Janky\\@vib.be>\n    Jacques van Helden <jvhelden@ulb.ac.be>\n\
  \n\e[1mCATEGORY\e[0m\n    comparative genomics\n\n\e[1mUSAGE\e[0m\n    get-orthologs\
  \ -org query_organism -q GENE1 -q GENE2 ... -taxon ref_taxon\n    [other options]\n\
  \n\e[1mORTHOLOGY CRITERIA\e[0m\n    \e[1mSemantic remark:\e[0m the appropriate criteria\
  \ for establishing \e[1morthology\e[0m or\n    \e[1mparalogy\e[0m relationship require\
  \ to reconciliate the species tree with the\n    molecular tree. For practical reasons,\
  \ we cannot do this for all the\n    species supported in RSAT. Pragmatically, \e\
  [33mget-orthologs\e[0m is thus based on\n    a very rudimentary (but widely used)\
  \ criterion to decide whether a gene\n    is or not ortholog: we run BLAST for all\
  \ proteins of the query genome\n    against all proteins of the reference taxon,\
  \ and maintain lists of hits\n    in subdirectories $RSAT/data/genome/[Organism_name]/blast_hits.\n\
  \n    The program filters the matches of these tables depending on the\n    user-specified\
  \ homology criteria and thresholds on all the fields.\n\n    Actually, this program\
  \ allows to retrieve supposed \e[1morthologs\e[0m (options\n    \e[1m-type BBH\e\
  [0m, and to some extent option \e[33m-type BH\e[0m), but also \e[1mparalogs\e[0m\n\
  \    (option -type all).\n\n\e[1mINPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    Query genes can be directly\
  \ entered on the command line (command -q) or\n    in an input file.\n\n    The\
  \ first word of each row of input file is considered as a query. Any\n    additional\
  \ information on the same row is ignored.\n\n\e[1mOUTPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    A tab-separated\
  \ file with two (or more) columns. Each row of the output\n    file describes one\
  \ similarity between a query gene and another gene\n    (orhtolog or paralog, depending\
  \ on the parameters).\n\n    The first column indicates the \"hit\" gene (the one\
  \ identified by BLAST\n    as similar to the query), the second column gives the\
  \ reference organism\n    (the organism in which the BLAST search was performed).\
  \ The third column\n    inciates the ID of the query gene.\n\n    Additional columns\
  \ (percentage of identity, hit rank, e_value, ...) can\n    be specified with the\
  \ option -return.\n\n    1. ID of the ortholog gene.\n    2. Name of the reference\
  \ organism.\n    3. ID of the query gene.\n    4. E-value\n    5. rank query ->\
  \ reference rank\n        Rank of this reference (target) gene among all those matching\
  \ the\n        same query gene for this pair of organisms.\n\n    6. s_rank reference\
  \ <- query rank\n        Reciprocal rank. Rank of this query gene among all those\
  \ matching\n        the same reference (target) gene for this pair of organisms.\n\
  \n\e[1mOPTIONS\e[0m\n    \e[1m-v #\e[0m\n        Level of verbosity (detail in the\
  \ warning messages during execution)\n\n    \e[1m-h\e[0m  Display full help message\n\
  \n    \e[1m-help\e[0m\n        Same as -h\n\n    \e[1m-i inputfile\e[0m\n      \
  \  If no input file is specified, the standard input is used. This\n        allows\
  \ to use the command within a pipe.\n\n    \e[1m-all\e[0m\n        Get orthologs\
  \ for all the genes of the query organism. This option\n        is particularly\
  \ convenient to extract phylogenetic profiles.\n\n    \e[1m-o outputfile\e[0m\n\
  \        If no output file is specified, the standard output is used. This\n   \
  \     allows to use the command within a pipe.\n\n    \e[1m-org query_organism\e\
  [0m\n        Organisms to whih the query gene(s) belong.\n\n    \e[1m-q query_gene\e\
  [0m\n        Query gene. The query can be either the gene identifier, or any\n \
  \       supported name (synonyms, cross-references).\n\n        This option can\
  \ be used iteratively on the same command to specify\n        multiple query genes.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-taxon ref_taxon\e[0m\n        Reference taxon. Orthologs are returned\
  \ for each supported organism\n        belonging to the reference taxon.\n\n   \
  \ \e[1m-depth #\e[0m\n        Depth for exploring the taxonomic tree. When the value\
  \ differs from\n        0, the program only returns one \"representative\" organism\
  \ per taxon\n        of the specified depth.\n\n        This option is convenient\
  \ to select a non-redundant set of species.\n        Note that the biological relevance\
  \ of the result strongly depends on\n        the annotation of the taxonomy in the\
  \ original database from whichb\n        RSAT genomes were downloaded.\n\n     \
  \   Positive value indicate that the tree should be traversed from root\n      \
  \  to leaves.\n\n        Negative values indicate that the tree should be traversed\
  \ from\n        leaves to root. Beware: level 0 is the species. Level -1 this\n\
  \        corresponds to the lowest level of the taxonomy.\n\n        Also note that\
  \ the depth of the taxonomic annotations vary along\n        branches, so that positive\
  \ values will give different results from\n        negative values.\n\n    \e[1m-unique_species\e\
  [0m\n        Retain at most one organism per species. This enables to filter out\n\
  \        the numerous strains sequences for some species of particular\n       \
  \ interest. (e.g. Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, ...).\n\n    \e[1m-unique_genus\e\
  [0m\n        Retain at most one organism per genus. Same filter as for\n       \
  \ -unique_species, but at the level of the genus. At this level we\n        don't\
  \ expect to have much redundancy, but this option can be useful\n        to select\
  \ a reasonable number of organisms, e.g. to draw\n        phylogenetic profile heatmaps.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-type homology_type\e[0m\n        Supported homology types: BBH,BH,all.\n\
  \n        Default: BBH\n\n        \e[33mall\e[0m Return all genes reported as similar\
  \ in the pre-computed BLAST\n            tables of RSAT (for details on BLAST procedure\
  \ used to build\n            these tables, type \e[33mgenome-blast -help\e[0m).\n\
  \n            The result thus contains not only orthologs but also paralogs.\n\n\
  \        \e[33mauto\e[0m\n            Automatically set thresholds to return the\
  \ BBH with reasonable\n            thresholds on additional fields (percent identity,\
  \ alignment\n            length).\n\n            This option automatically adds\
  \ the following parameters:\n\n            Return percent of identity -return ident\n\
  \n            Return alignment length, and set threshold to at least 50 bp\n   \
  \         -return ali_len -lth ali_len 50\n\n            Return e-value, and set\

  \            criterion, it returns the BBH, also called RBH) -return s_rank\n  \

  \        ank,s_rank\n\n    \e[1m-return output_fields\e[0m\n        Output field(s).\n\
  \n        By default, the output is a two-column file indicating the ID of the\n\
  \        gene identified as similar to the query gene, and the name of the\n   \
  \     reference organism.\n\n        The option -return can be used to specify additional\
  \ output fields.\n\n        Supported fields:\n\n            ref_id\n          \
  \      ID of the reference (target) gene\n\n            ref_organism\n         \

  \     s_rank\n                Source rank (rank of the hit for the query organism).\n\
  \n        The option -return can be used iteratively on the same command line\n\
  \        to specify several output fields. Another way to specify multiple\n   \
  \     output fields is to enter them separated by commas.\n\n        Examples:\n\
  \n            -return query_id -return e_value -return rank\n\n            -return\
  \ query_id,e_value,rank\n\n    \e[1m-nogrep\e[0m\n        Disable the pre-filtering\
  \ with grep. This pre-filtering accelerates\n        the selection of hits, but\
  \ some grep versions do not support the -E\n        option. If this is the case\
  \ on your operating system, you can still\n        obtain the correct results by\
  \ inactivating the grep filter.\n\n    \e[1m-org_list\e[0m\n        This option\
  \ gives the posibility to specify a set of reference\n        organisms rather than\
  \ a taxon. Orthologs will only be searched in\n        the organisms belonging to\
  \ the given list.\n\n        File format: each row should contain the identifier\
  \ of one organism.\n        Lines starting with a semicolumn are ignored.\n\n  \
  \  \e[1m-diamond\e[0m\n        Use ranks_dmnd from diamond blast computed in genome-blast.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-rand\e[0m\n        When the option \e[33m-rand\e[0m is activated, the\
  \ program replaces each\n        ortholog by a gene selected at random in the genome\
  \ where this\n        ortholg was found.\n\n        This option is used (for example\
  \ by \e[33mfootprint-scan\e[0m and\n        \e[33mfootprint-discovery\e[0m to perform\
  \ negative controls, i.e. check the\n        rate of false positives in randomly\
  \ selected promoters of the\n        reference taxon.\n\n    \e[1m-nowarn\e[0m\n\
  \        Do not issue warning about organisms for which there is no BLAST\n    \
