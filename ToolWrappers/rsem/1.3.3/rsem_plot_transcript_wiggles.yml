  \    This program generates transcript wiggle plots and outputs them in a pdf\n\
  \    file. This program can accept either a list of transcript ids or gene\n   \
  \ ids (if transcript to gene mapping information is provided) and has two\n    modes\
  \ of showing wiggle plots. If '--show-unique' is not specified, the\n    wiggle\
  \ plot for each transcript is a histogram where each position has\n    the expected\
  \ read depth at this position as its height. If\n    '--show-unique' is specified,\
  \ for each transcript a stacked bar plot is\n    generated. For each position, the\
  \ read depth of unique reads, which have\n    only one alignment, is showed in black.\
  \ The read depth of multi-reads,\n    which align to more than one places, is showed\
  \ in red on top of the read\n    depth of unique reads.This program will use some\
  \ files RSEM generated\n    previouslly. So please do not delete/move any file\n\
  \    'rsem-calculate-expression' generated. If allele-specific expression is\n \
  \   calculated, the basic unit for plotting is an allele-specific transcript\n \
  \   and plots can be grouped by either transcript ids (--transcript-list) or\n \
  \   gene ids (--gene-list).\n\nOUTPUT\n    output_plot_file\n        This is a pdf\
  \ file containing all plots generated. If a list of\n        transcript ids is provided,\
  \ each page display at most 6 plots in 3\n        rows and 2 columns. If gene ids\
  \ are provided, each page display a\n        gene. The gene's id is showed at the\
  \ top and all its transcripts'\n        wiggle plots are showed in this page. The\
  \ arrangement of plots is\n        determined automatically. For each transcript\
  \ wiggle plot, the\n        transcript id is displayed as title. x-axis is position\
  \ in the\n        transcript and y-axis is read depth. If allele-specific expression\n\
  \        is calculated, the basin unit becomes an allele-specific transcript\n \
  \       and transcript ids and gene ids can be used to group allele-specific\n \
  \       transcripts.\n\n    sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam and sample_name.transcript.readdepth\n\
  \        If these files do not exist, 'rsem-plot-transcript-wiggles' will\n    \
  \    automatically generate them.\n\n    sample_name.uniq.transcript.bam, sample_name.uniq.transcript.sorted.bam\n\
  \    and sample_name.uniq.transcript.readdepth\n        If '--show-unique' option\
  \ is specified and these files do not exist,\n        'rsem-plot-transcript-wiggles'\
  \ will automatically generate them.\n\nEXAMPLES\n    Suppose sample_name and output_plot_file\
  \ are set to\n    'mmliver_single_quals' and 'output.pdf' respectively. input_list\
  \ is set\n    to 'transcript_ids.txt' if transcript ids are provided, and is set\
  \ to\n    'gene_ids.txt' if gene ids are provided.\n\n    1) Transcript ids are\
  \ provided and we just want normal wiggle plots:\n\n     rsem-plot-transcript-wiggles\
  \ mmliver_single_quals transcript_ids.txt output.pdf\n\n    2) Gene ids are provided\
  \ and we want to show stacked bar plots:\n\n     rsem-plot-transcript-wiggles --gene-list\
  \ --show-unique mmliver_single_quals gene_ids.txt output.pdf\n\n"
