help_text: "Usage: rsem-simulate-reads reference_name estimated_model_file estimated_isoform_results\
  \ theta0 N output_name [--seed seed] [-q]\n\nParameters:\n\nreference_name: The\
  \ name of RSEM references, which should be already generated by 'rsem-prepare-reference'\n\
  estimated_model_file: This file describes how the RNA-Seq reads will be sequenced\
  \ given the expression levels. It determines what kind of reads will be simulated\
  \ (single-end/paired-end, w/o quality score) and includes parameters for fragment\
  \ length distribution, read start position distribution, sequencing error models,\
  \ etc. Normally, this file should be learned from real data using 'rsem-calculate-expression'.\
  \ The file can be found under the 'sample_name.stat' folder with the name of 'sample_name.model'\n\
  estimated_isoform_results: This file contains expression levels for all isoforms\
  \ recorded in the reference. It can be learned using 'rsem-calculate-expression'\
  \ from real data. The corresponding file users want to use is 'sample_name.isoforms.results'.\
  \ If simulating from user-designed expression profile is desired, start from a learned\
  \ 'sample_name.isoforms.results' file and only modify the 'TPM' column. The simulator\
  \ only reads the TPM column. But keeping the file format the same is required. If\
  \ the RSEM references built are aware of allele-specific transcripts, 'sample_name.alleles.results'\
  \ should be used instead.\ntheta0: This parameter determines the fraction of reads\
  \ that are coming from background \"noise\" (instead of from a transcript). It can\
  \ also be estimated using 'rsem-calculate-expression' from real data. Users can\
  \ find it as the first value of the third line of the file 'sample_name.stat/sample_name.theta'.\n\
  N: The total number of reads to be simulated. If 'rsem-calculate-expression' is\
  \ executed on a real data set, the total number of reads can be found as the 4th\
  \ number of the first line of the file 'sample_name.stat/sample_name.cnt'.\noutput_name:\
  \ Prefix for all output files.\n--seed seed: Set seed for the random number generator\
  \ used in simulation. The seed should be a 32-bit unsigned integer.\n-q: Set it\
  \ will stop outputting intermediate information.\n\nOutputs:\n\noutput_name.sim.isoforms.results,\
  \ output_name.sim.genes.results: Expression levels estimated by counting where each\
  \ simulated read comes from.\noutput_name.sim.alleles.results: Allele-specific expression\
  \ levels estimated by counting where each simulated read comes from.\n\noutput_name.fa\
  \ if single-end without quality score;\noutput_name.fq if single-end with quality\
  \ score;\noutput_name_1.fa & output_name_2.fa if paired-end without quality score;\n\
  output_name_1.fq & output_name_2.fq if paired-end with quality score.\n\nFormat\
  \ of the header line: Each simulated read's header line encodes where it comes from.\
  \ The header line has the format:\n\n\t{>/@}_rid_dir_sid_pos[_insertL]\n\n{>/@}:\
  \ Either '>' or '@' must appear. '>' appears if FASTA files are generated and '@'\
  \ appears if FASTQ files are generated\nrid: Simulated read's index, numbered from\
  \ 0\ndir: The direction of the simulated read. 0 refers to forward strand ('+')\
  \ and 1 refers to reverse strand ('-')\nsid: Represent which transcript this read\
  \ is simulated from. It ranges between 0 and M, where M is the total number of transcripts.\
  \ If sid=0, the read is simulated from the background noise. Otherwise, the read\
  \ is simulated from a transcript with index sid. Transcript sid's transcript name\
  \ can be found in the 'transcript_id' column of the 'sample_name.isoforms.results'\
  \ file (at line sid + 1, line 1 is for column names)\npos: The start position of\
  \ the simulated read in strand dir of transcript sid. It is numbered from 0\ninsertL:\
  \ Only appear for paired-end reads. It gives the insert length of the simulated\
  \ read.\n\nExample:\n\nSuppose we want to simulate 50 millon single-end reads with\
  \ quality scores and use the parameters learned from [Example](#example). In addition,\
  \ we set theta0 as 0.2 and output_name as 'simulated_reads'. The command is:\n\n\
  \trsem-simulate-reads /ref/mouse_125 mmliver_single_quals.stat/mmliver_single_quals.model\
  \ mmliver_single_quals.isoforms.results 0.2 50000000 simulated_reads\n"
