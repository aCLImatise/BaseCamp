help_text: "\nBBMap\nWritten by Brian Bushnell, from Dec. 2010 - present\nLast modified\
  \ February 13, 2020\n\nDescription:  Fast and accurate splice-aware read aligner.\n\
  Please read bbmap/docs/guides/BBMapGuide.txt for more information.\n\nTo index:\
  \     bbmap.sh ref=<reference fasta>\nTo map:       bbmap.sh in=<reads> out=<output\
  \ sam>\nTo map without writing an index:\n    bbmap.sh ref=<reference fasta> in=<reads>\
  \ out=<output sam> nodisk\n\nin=stdin will accept reads from standard in, and out=stdout\
  \ will write to \nstandard out, but file extensions are still needed to specify\
  \ the format of the \ninput and output files e.g. in=stdin.fa.gz will read gzipped\
  \ fasta from \nstandard in; out=stdout.sam.gz will write gzipped sam.\n\nIndexing\
  \ Parameters (required when building the index):\nnodisk=f                Set to\
  \ true to build index in memory and write nothing \n                        to disk\
  \ except output.\nref=<file>              Specify the reference sequence.  Only\
  \ do this ONCE, \n                        when building the index (unless using\
  \ 'nodisk').\nbuild=1                 If multiple references are indexed in the\
  \ same directory,\n                        each needs a unique numeric ID (unless\
  \ using 'nodisk').\nk=13                    Kmer length, range 8-15.  Longer is\
  \ faster but uses \n                        more memory.  Shorter is more sensitive.\n\
  \                        If indexing and mapping are done in two steps, K should\n\
  \                        be specified each time.\npath=<.>                Specify\
  \ the location to write the index, if you don't \n                        want it\
  \ in the current working directory.\nusemodulo=f             Throw away ~80% of\
  \ kmers based on remainder modulo a \n                        number (reduces RAM\
  \ by 50% and sensitivity slightly).\n                        Should be enabled both\
  \ when building the index AND \n                        when mapping.\nrebuild=f\
  \               Force a rebuild of the index (ref= should be set).\n\nInput Parameters:\n\
  build=1                 Designate index to use.  Corresponds to the number \n  \
  \                      specified when building the index.\nin=<file>           \
  \    Primary reads input; required parameter.\nin2=<file>              For paired\
  \ reads in two files.\ninterleaved=auto        True forces paired/interleaved input;\
  \ false forces \n                        single-ended mapping. If not specified,\
  \ interleaved \n                        status will be autodetected from read names.\n\
  fastareadlen=500        Break up FASTA reads longer than this.  Max is 500 for\n\
  \                        BBMap and 6000 for BBMapPacBio.  Only works for FASTA\n\
  \                        input (use 'maxlen' for FASTQ input).  The default for\n\
  \                        bbmap.sh is 500, and for mapPacBio.sh is 6000.\nunpigz=f\
  \                Spawn a pigz (parallel gzip) process for faster \n            \
  \            decompression than using Java.  \n                        Requires\
  \ pigz to be installed.\ntouppercase=t           (tuc) Convert lowercase letters\
  \ in reads to upper case \n                        (otherwise they will not match\
  \ the reference).\n\nSampling Parameters:\n\nreads=-1                Set to a positive\
  \ number N to only process the first N\n                        reads (or pairs),\
  \ then quit.  -1 means use all reads.\nsamplerate=1            Set to a number from\
  \ 0 to 1 to randomly select that\n                        fraction of reads for\
  \ mapping. 1 uses all reads.\nskipreads=0             Set to a number N to skip\
  \ the first N reads (or pairs), \n                        then map the rest.\n\n\
  Mapping Parameters:\nfast=f                  This flag is a macro which sets other\
  \ paramters to run \n                        faster, at reduced sensitivity.  Bad\
  \ for RNA-seq.\nslow=f                  This flag is a macro which sets other paramters\
  \ to run \n                        slower, at greater sensitivity.  'vslow' is even\
  \ slower.\nmaxindel=16000          Don't look for indels longer than this. Lower\
  \ is faster.\n                        Set to >=100k for RNAseq with long introns\
  \ like mammals.\nstrictmaxindel=f        When enabled, do not allow indels longer\
  \ than 'maxindel'.\n                        By default these are not sought, but\
  \ may be found anyway.\ntipsearch=100           Look this far for read-end deletions\
  \ with anchors\n                        shorter than K, using brute force.\nminid=0.76\
  \              Approximate minimum alignment identity to look for. \n          \
  \              Higher is faster and less sensitive.\nminhits=1               Minimum\
  \ number of seed hits required for candidate sites.\n                        Higher\
  \ is faster.\nlocal=f                 Set to true to use local, rather than global,\
  \ alignments.\n                        This will soft-clip ugly ends of poor alignments.\n\
  perfectmode=f           Allow only perfect mappings when set to true (very fast).\n\
  semiperfectmode=f       Allow only perfect and semiperfect (perfect except for \n\
  \                        N's in the reference) mappings.\nthreads=auto         \
  \   (t) Set to number of threads desired.  By default, uses \n                 \
  \       all cores available.\nambiguous=best          (ambig) Set behavior on ambiguously-mapped\
  \ reads (with \n                        multiple top-scoring mapping locations).\n\
  \                            best    (use the first best site)\n               \
  \             toss    (consider unmapped)\n                            random  (select\
  \ one top-scoring site randomly)\n                            all     (retain all\
  \ top-scoring sites)\nsamestrandpairs=f       (ssp) Specify whether paired reads\
  \ should map to the\n                        same strand or opposite strands.\n\
  requirecorrectstrand=t  (rcs) Forbid pairing of reads without correct strand \n\
  \                        orientation.  Set to false for long-mate-pair libraries.\n\
  killbadpairs=f          (kbp) If a read pair is mapped with an inappropriate\n \
  \                       insert size or orientation, the read with the lower  \n\
  \                        mapping quality is marked unmapped.\npairedonly=f     \
  \       (po) Treat unpaired reads as unmapped.  Thus they will \n              \
  \          be sent to 'outu' but not 'outm'.\nrcomp=f                 Reverse complement\
  \ both reads prior to mapping (for LMP\n                        outward-facing libraries).\n\
  rcompmate=f             Reverse complement read2 prior to mapping.\npairlen=32000\
  \           Set max allowed distance between paired reads.  \n                 \
  \       (insert size)=(pairlen)+(read1 length)+(read2 length)\nrescuedist=1200 \
  \        Don't try to rescue paired reads if avg. insert size\n                \
  \        greater than this.  Lower is faster.\nrescuemismatches=32     Maximum mismatches\
  \ allowed in a rescued read.  Lower\n                        is faster.\naveragepairdist=100\
  \     (apd) Initial average distance between paired reads.\n                   \
  \     Varies dynamically; does not need to be specified.\ndeterministic=f      \
  \   Run in deterministic mode.  In this case it is good\n                      \
  \  to set averagepairdist.  BBMap is deterministic\n                        without\
  \ this flag if using single-ended reads,\n                        or run singlethreaded.\n\
  bandwidthratio=0        (bwr) If above zero, restrict alignment band to this \n\
  \                        fraction of read length.  Faster but less accurate.\nbandwidth=0\
  \             (bw) Set the bandwidth directly.\n                        fraction\
  \ of read length.  Faster but less accurate.\nusejni=f                (jni) Do alignments\
  \ faster, in C code.  Requires \n                        compiling the C code; details\
  \ are in /jni/README.txt.\nmaxsites2=800           Don't analyze (or print) more\
  \ than this many alignments \n                        per read.\nignorefrequentkmers=t\
  \   (ifk) Discard low-information kmers that occur often.\nexcludefraction=0.03\
  \    (ef) Fraction of kmers to ignore.  For example, 0.03\n                    \
  \    will ignore the most common 3% of kmers.\ngreedy=t                Use a greedy\
  \ algorithm to discard the least-useful\n                        kmers on a per-read\
  \ basis.\nkfilter=0               If positive, potential mapping sites must have\
  \ at\n                        least this many consecutive exact matches.\n\n\nQuality\
  \ and Trimming Parameters:\nqin=auto                Set to 33 or 64 to specify input\
  \ quality value ASCII\n                        offset. 33 is Sanger, 64 is old Solexa.\n\
  qout=auto               Set to 33 or 64 to specify output quality value ASCII \n\
  \                        offset (only if output format is fastq).\nqtrim=f     \
  \            Quality-trim ends before mapping.  Options are: \n                \
  \        'f' (false), 'l' (left), 'r' (right), and 'lr' (both).\nuntrim=f      \

  \ (maq) Do not map reads with average quality below this.\nmaqb=0              \

  \ reads with a mapped mate.\nmappedonly=f            If true, treats 'out' like\
  \ 'outm'.\nbamscript=<file>        (bs) Write a shell script to <file> that will\
  \ turn \n                        the sam output into a sorted, indexed bam file.\n\
  ordered=f               Set to true to output reads in same order as input.  \n\

  \ filter to ignore reads not sharing kmers\n                        with the reference.\

  \        ensuring both reads have the same name.\nintronlen=999999999     Set to\
  \ a lower number like 10 to change 'D' to 'N' in \n                        cigar\
  \ strings for deletions of at least that length.\nrgid=                   Set readgroup\

  -Xmx                    This will set Java's memory usage, \n                  \
  \      overriding autodetection.\n                        -Xmx20g will specify 20\
  \ gigs of RAM, and -Xmx800m \n                        will specify 800 megs.  The\
  \ max is typically 85% of \n                        physical memory.  The human\
  \ genome requires around 24g,\n                        or 12g with the 'usemodulo'\
  \ flag.  The index uses \n                        roughly 6 bytes per reference\
  \ base.\n-eoom                   This flag will cause the process to exit if an\
  \ \n                        out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n\
  -da                     Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at\
