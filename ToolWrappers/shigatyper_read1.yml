  \ read2\n\nShigaTyper v. 1.0.6, 2019\n\nA WGS-based genoserotyping pipeline for\
  \ Shigella spp.\n\nYun Wu, Henry K Lau, Teresa Lee, David K Lau, Justin Payne\n\n\
  \    The bacteria Shigella spp., consisting of 4 species and >50\nserotypes, cause\
  \ shigellosis, a foodborne disease of significant\nmorbidity, mortality, and economic\
  \ loss worldwide. Classical Shigella\nidentification based on selective media and\
  \ serology is tedious,\ntime-consuming, expensive, and not always accurate. Molecular\
  \ diagnostic\nassay does not distinguish Shigella at species level or from\nenteroinvasive\
  \ Escherichia coli (EIEC). We inspected the whole genome\nsequencing (WGS) data\
  \ from 219 Shigella isolates and observed low\nconcordance rate between conventional\
  \ designation and molecular\nserotyping, 86.8% and 78.9% at species and serotype\
  \ level, respectively.\nSerotype determinants for 6 additional serotypes were identified.\n\
  Examination of differentiation gene markers commonly perceived as\ncharacteristic\
  \ hallmarks in Shigella showed high variability among\ndifferent serotypes. Using\
  \ this information, we developed ShigaTyper, an\nautomated workflow that utilizes\
  \ limited computational resources to\naccurately and rapidly determine 58 Shigella\
  \ serotypes using Illumina\npaired end WGS reads. Shigella serotype determinants\
  \ and species-specific\ndiagnostic markers were first identified through read alignment\
  \ to an\nin-house curated reference sequence database. Relying on sequence hits\n\
  that passed a threshold level of coverage and accuracy, serotype can be\nunambiguously\
  \ predicted within 1 min for an average sized WGS sample of\n~500 MB. Validation\
  \ with WGS data from 112 isolates show an accuracy of\n98.2%. This pipeline is the\
  \ first step towards building a comprehensive\nWGS-based analysis pipeline of Shigella\
  \ spp. in a field laboratory\nsetting, where speed is essential and resources need\
  \ to be more\ncost-effectively dedicated.\n\npositional arguments:\n  read1\n  read2\n\
