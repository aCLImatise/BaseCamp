    directory. The advantage of using the default\ndirectory at the time of set up\
    \ is that every user of\nanvi'o on a computer system will be using a single\n\
    data directory, but then you may need to run the setup\nprogram with superuser\
    \ privileges. If you don't have\nsuperuser privileges, then you can use this parameter\n\
    to tell anvi'o the location you wish to use to setup\nyour database."
