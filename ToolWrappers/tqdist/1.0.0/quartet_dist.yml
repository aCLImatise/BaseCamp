help_text: "Usage: quartet_dist [-v] <filename1> <filename2>\n\nWhere: <filename1>\
  \ and <filename2> point to two files each containing\none tree in Newick format.\
  \ In both trees all leaves should be labeled\nand the two trees should have the\
  \ same set of leaf labels.\nThe quartet distance between the two trees will be printed\
  \ to stdout.\nIf the -v option is used, the following numbers will be reported (in\
  \ this\norder):\n\t - The number of leaves in the trees (should be the same for\
  \ both).\n\t - The number of quartets in the two trees (n choose 3).\n\t - The quartet\
  \ distance between the two trees.\n\t - The normalized quartet distance between\
  \ the two trees.\n\t - The number of resolved quartets that agree in the two trees.\n\
  \t - The normalized number of resolved quartets that agree in the two trees.\n\t\
  \ - The number of quartets that are unresolved in both trees.\n\t - The normalized\
  \ number of quartets that are unresolved in both trees.\n\n"
