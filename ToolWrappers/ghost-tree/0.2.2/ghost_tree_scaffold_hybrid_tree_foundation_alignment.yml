help_text: "Usage: ghost-tree scaffold hybrid-tree-foundation-alignment \n       \
  \    [OPTIONS] EXTENSION_TREES_OTU_MAP EXTENSION_TREES_TAXONOMY_FILE\n         \
  \  EXTENSION_TREES_SEQUENCE_FILE FOUNDATION_ALIGNMENT_FILE\n           GHOST_TREE_OUTPUT_FOLDER\n\
  \n  Make hybrid-tree using foundation alignment.\n\n  Combines two genetic databases\
  \ into one phylogenetic tree and is the final\n  command in ghost-tree.\n\n  Some\
  \ genetic databases provide finer taxonomic resolution, but high\n  sequence variability\
  \ causes poor multiple sequence alignments (we consider\n  these \"extension trees\"\
  ).\n\n  Other databases provide high quality phylogenetic information (hence they\n\
  \  can be used as the \"foundation\" tree), but they provide poor quality\n  taxonomic\
  \ resolution.\n\n  The output file is one phylogenetic tree in .nwk format, which\
  \ has the\n  benefits of both databases. This allows sequencing to be performed\
  \ using\n  only one primer set, the \"extension trees\" primer set.\n\n  Arguments:\n\
  \n  1) extension-trees-otu-map: Tab-delimited text file containing OTU\n  clusters\
  \ in rows containing accession numbers only. Format can be 1) where\n  the accession\
  \ number is in the first column with only one column or 2) it\n  can contain accession\
  \ numbers clustered in tab-delimited rows containing\n  more accession numbers,\
  \ which are part of that OTU cluster (as in output\n  of \"ghost-tree group-extensions\"\
  ). This file refers to the \"extension\n  trees\". File references to sequence reads\
  \ or sample numbers/names are not\n  valid here. This is NOT the same as an OTU\
  \ .biom table.\n\n  2) extension-trees-taxonomy-file: Tab-delimited text file related\
  \ to\n  \"extension trees\" wih the 1st column being an accession number (same\n\
  \  accession numbers in extension-trees-otu-map and extension-trees-taxonomy-\n\
  \  file) and the 2nd column is the taxonomy ranking in the following format:\n \
  \ k__Fungi;p__Basidiomycota;c__Agaricomycetes;o__Sebacinales;\n  f__Sebacinaceae;g__unidentified;s__Sebacina\n\
  \n  3) extension-trees-sequence-file: The .fasta formated sequences for the\n  \"\
  extension trees\" genetic dataset. Sequence identifiers are the accession\n  numbers.\
  \ These accession numbers are the same as in the extension-trees-\n  otu-map and\
  \ extension-trees-taxonomy-file.\n\n  4) foundation-alignment-file: File containing\
  \ aligned sequences from a\n  genetic marker database in .fasta format. This file\
  \ refers to the\n  \"foundation\" of the ghost-tree.\n\n  .fasta contains accession\
  \ numbers *and* taxonomy labels.\n\n  Note: if you would like to use a newick tree\
  \ foundation, use the hybrid-\n  tree-foundation-tree command, also in the 'scaffold'\
  \ command group.\n\n  5) ghost-tree-output-folder: Output folder contains files\
  \ including:\n\n  a) The Newick formatted ghost-tree, which is the final output\
  \ of the\n  ghost-tree tool. This is a phylogenetic tree designed for downstream\n\
  \  diversity analyses.\n\n  b) Accession IDs from the ghost-tree.nwk file that you\
  \ can use for\n  downstream analyses tools\n\n  c) log error file (this is an optional\
  \ file that you can have if you type\n  '--stderr')\n\nOptions:\n  --graft-level\
  \ [p|c|o|f|g]    Taxonomic level to graft extensions to\n                      \
  \         foundation. Default is g (genus). p=phylum,\n                        \
  \       c=class, o=order, f=family.\n  --stderr                     Saves error\
  \ log file (optional)\n  --save-foundation-alignment  Saves non-redundant foundation\
  \ alignment file\n                               (optional)\n  --save-foundation-tree\
  \       Saves foundation phylogenetic tree file\n                              \
  \ (optional)\n  --exclude-id-list            Will not save accession id file (optional)\n\
