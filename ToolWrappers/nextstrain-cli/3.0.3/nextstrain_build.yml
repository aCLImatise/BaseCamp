  \ build --help\n\nRuns a pathogen build in the Nextstrain build environment.\n\n\
  The build directory should contain a Snakefile, which will be run with\nsnakemake.\n\
  \nThe default build environment is inside an ephemeral Docker container which has\n\
  all the necessary Nextstrain components available.  You may instead run the\nbuild\
  \ in the native ambient environment by passing the --native flag, but all\ndependencies\
  \ must already be installed and configured.  For larger builds, you\nmay want to\
  \ use the --aws-batch flag to launch jobs on AWS Batch instead of\nrunning locally\
  \ (if the required AWS resources are configured in your AWS\naccount).\n\nYou can\
  \ test if Docker, native, or AWS Batch build environments are properly\nsupported\
  \ on your computer by running:\n\n    nextstrain check-setup\n\nThe `nextstrain\
  \ build` command is designed to cleanly separate the Nextstrain\nbuild interface\
  \ from provisioning a build environment, so that running builds\nis as easy as possible.\
