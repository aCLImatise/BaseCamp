  \ How do I site mothur?\e[0m\n\tSchloss, P.D., et al., Introducing mothur: Open-source,\
  \ platform-independent, community-supported software for describing and comparing\
  \ microbial communities. Appl Environ Microbiol, 2009. 75(23):7537-41.\n\n\e[1m\e\
  [34m2. Do you have an example analysis?\e[0m\n\tYes, https://mothur.org/wiki/454_SOP\
  \ and https://mothur.org/wiki/MiSeq_SOP highlight some of the things you can do\
  \ with mothur.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m3. Do you offer workshops?\e[0m\n\tYes! Please see\
  \ our https://mothur.org/wiki/Workshops page for more information.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m4.\
  \ What are mothur's file types?\e[0m\n\tMothur uses and creates many file types.\
  \ Including fasta, name, group, design, count, list, rabund, sabund, shared, relabund,\
  \ oligos, taxonomy, constaxonomy, phylip, column, flow, qfile, file, biom and tree.\
  \ You can find out more about these formats here: https://www.mothur.org/wiki/File_Types.\n\
  \n\e[1m\e[34m5. Is there a list of all of mothur's commands?\e[0m\n\tYes! You can\
  \ find it here, http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Category:Commands.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m6. Why\
  \ does the cutoff change when I cluster with average neighbor?\e[0m\n\tThis is a\
  \ product of using the average neighbor algorithm with a sparse distance matrix.\
  \ When you run cluster, the algorithm looks for pairs of sequences to merge in the\
  \ rows and columns that are getting merged together. Let's say you set the cutoff\
  \ to 0.05. If one cell has a distance of 0.03 and the cell it is getting merged\
  \ with has a distance above 0.05 then the cutoff is reset to 0.03, because it's\
  \ not possible to merge at a higher level and keep all the data. All of the sequences\
  \ are still there from multiple phyla. Incidentally, although we always see this,\
  \ it is a bigger problem for people that include sequences that do not fully overlap.\n\
  \n\e[1m\e[32m\nCommon Issues: \n\e[0m\n\e[1m\e[34m1. Mothur can't find my input\
  \ files. What wrong?\e[0m\n\tBy default, mothur will then look for the input files\
  \ in the directory where mothur's executable is located. Mothur will also search\
  \ the input, output and temporary default locations. You can set these locations\
  \ using the set.dir command: set.dir(input=/users/myuser/desktop/mothurdata). Alternatively\
  \ you can provide complete file names, or move the input files to mothur's executable\
  \ location.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m2. I installed the latest version, but I am still running\
  \ an older version. Why?\e[0m\n\tWe often see this issue when you have an older\
  \ version of mothur installed in your path. You can find out where by opening a\
  \ terminal window and running: \n\n\tyourusername$ which mothur\n\tpath_to_old_version\n\
  \tfor example: yourusername$ which mothur\n\t/usr/local/bin\n\n\tWhen you find the\
  \ location of the older version, you can delete it or move it out of your path with\
  \ the following:\n\n\tyourusername$ mv path_to_old_version/mothur new_location\n\
  \tfor example: yourusername$ mv /usr/local/bin/mothur /Users/yourusername/desktop/old_version_mothur\n\
  \n\e[1m\e[34m3. File Mismatches - 'yourSequence is in fileA but not in fileB, please\
  \ correct.'\e[0m\n\tThe most common reason this occurs is because you forgot to\
  \ include a name or count file on a command, or accidentally included the wrong\
  \ one due to a typo. Mothur has a 'current' option, which allows you to set file\
  \ parameters to 'current'. For example, if fasta=current mothur will use the last\
  \ fasta file given or created. The current option was designed to help avoid typo\
  \ mistakes due to mothur's long filenames. Another reason this might occur is a\
  \ process failing when you are using multiple processors. If a process dies, a file\
  \ can be incomplete which would cause a mismatch error downstream.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m4.\
  \ I don't have enough RAM or processing power. What are my options?\e[0m\n\tIf you\
  \ are using multiple processors, try running the command with processors=1, the\
  \ more processors you use the more memory is required.\n\tAlternatively, you can\
  \ use AWS to run your analysis. Here are instructions: https://mothur.org/wiki/Mothur_AMI.\n\
  \n\e[1m\e[34m5. Mothur crashes when I read my distance file. What's wrong?\e[0m\n\
  \tThere are two common causes for this, file size and format.\n\n\tFileSize:\tThe\
  \ cluster command loads your distance matrix into RAM, and your distance file is\
  \ most likely too large to fit in RAM. There are two options to help with this.\
  \ The first is to use a cutoff. By using a cutoff mothur will only load distances\
  \ that are below the cutoff. If that is still not enough, there is a command called\
  \ cluster.split, http://www.mothur.org/wiki/cluster.split. Cluster.split divides\
  \ the dataset by taxonomic assignment and generates matrices for each grouping,\
  \ and then clusters the smaller pieces separately. You may also be able to reduce\
  \ the size of the original distance matrix by using the commands outline in the\
  \ Schloss SOP, http://www.mothur.org/wiki/Schloss_SOP\n\n\tWrong Format:\tThis error\
  \ can be caused by trying to read a column formatted distance matrix using the phylip\
  \ parameter. By default, the dist.seqs command generates a column formatted distance\
  \ matrix. To make a phylip formatted matrix set the dist.seqs command parameter\
  \ output to lt.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m6. Why do I have such a large distance matrix?\e[0m\n\
  \tThis is most often caused by poor overlap of your reads. When reads have poor\
  \ overlap, it greatly increases your error rate. Also, sequences that should cluster\
  \ together don't because the errors appear to be genetic differences when in fact\
  \ they are not. The quality of the data you are processing can not be overstressed.\
  \ Error filled reads produce error filled results!\n\n\tCheck out Pat's blog: http://blog.mothur.org/2014/09/11/Why-such-a-large-distance-matrix/\n\
  \n\tNOTE: To take a step back, if you look through our MiSeq SOP, you’ll see that\
  \ we go to great pains to only work with the unique sequences to limit the number\
  \ of sequences we have to align, screen for chimeras, classify, etc. We all know\
  \ that 20 million reads will never make it through the pipeline without setting\
  \ your computer on fire. Returning to the question at hand, you can imagine that\
  \ if the reads do not fully overlap then any error in the 5’ end of the first read\
  \ will be uncorrected by the 3’ end of the second read. If we assume for now that\
  \ the errors are random, then every error will generate a new unique sequence. Granted,\
  \ this happens less than 1% of the time, but multiply that by 20 million reads at\
  \ whatever length you choose and you’ve got a big number. Viola, a bunch of unique\
  \ reads and a ginormous distance matrix.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m7. Mothur reports a 'bad_alloc'\
  \ error in the shhh.flows command. What's wrong?\e[0m\n\tThis error indicates your\
  \ computer is running out of memory. The shhh.flows command is very memory intensive.\
  \ This error is most commonly caused by trying to process a dataset too large, using\
  \ multiple processors, or failing to run trim.flows before shhh.flows. If you are\
  \ using multiple processors, try running the command with processors=1, the more\
  \ processors you use the more memory is required. Running trim.flows with an oligos\
  \ file, and then shhh.flows with the file option may also resolve the issue. If\
  \ for some reason you are unable to run shhh.flows with your data, a good alternative\
  \ is to use the trim.seqs command using a 50-bp sliding window and to trim the sequence\
  \ when the average quality score over that window drops below 35. Our results suggest\
  \ that the sequencing error rates by this method are very good, but not quite as\
  \ good as by shhh.flows and that the resulting sequences tend to be a bit shorter.\n\
  \n\e[1m\e[32m\nHow To: \n\e[0m\n\e[1m\e[34m1. How do I make a tree?\e[0m\n\tMothur\
  \ has two commands that create trees: clearcut and tree.shared.\n\n\tThe clearcut\
  \ commands creates a phylogenetic tree that represents how sequences relate. The\
  \ clearcut program written by Initiative for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies\
  \ (IBEST) at the University of Idaho. For more information about clearcut please\
  \ refer to http://bioinformatics.hungry.com/clearcut/\n\n\tThe tree.shared command\
  \ will generate a newick-formatted tree file that describes the dissimilarity (1-similarity)\
  \ among multiple groups. Groups are clustered using the UPGMA algorithm using the\
  \ distance between communities as calculated using any of the calculators describing\
  \ the similarity in community membership or structure.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m2. How do I\
  \ know 'who' is in an OTU in a shared file?\e[0m\n\tYou can run the get.otulist\
  \ command on the list file you used to generate the shared file. You want to be\
  \ sure you are comparing the same distances. ie final.opti_mcc.0.03.otulist would\
  \ relate to the 0.03 distance in your shared file. Also, if you subsample your data\
  \ set and want to compare things, be sure to subsample the list and group file and\
  \ then create the shared file to make sure you are working with the same sequences.\n\
  \n\tsub.sample(list=yourListFile, count=yourCountFile, persample=t)\n\tmake.shared(list=yourSubsampledListFile,\
  \ group=yourSubsampledCountFile, label=0.03)\n\tget.otulist(list=yourSubsampledListFile,\
  \ label=0.03)\n\n\e[1m\e[34m3. How do I know 'who' is in the OTUs represented in\
  \ the venn picture?\e[0m\n\tYou can use the get.sharedseqs command. Be sure to pay\
  \ close attention to the 'unique' and 'shared' parameters.\n\n\e[1m\e[34m4. How\
  \ do I select certain sequences or groups of sequences?\e[0m\n\tMothur has several\
  \ 'get' and 'remove' commands: get.seqs, get.lineage, get.groups, get.dists, get.otus,\
  \ remove.seqs, remove.lineage, remove.dists, remove.otus and remove.groups.\n\n\e\
  [1m\e[34m5. How do I visualize my results from mothur?\e[0m\n\tTo visual your data\
  \ with R follow this tutorial http://www.riffomonas.org/minimalR/06_line_plots.html.\n\
