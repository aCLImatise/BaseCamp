  \nDESCRIPTION:\nConverts coordinates of features in a GFF file according to a multiple\n\
  alignment.  Will map from the coordinate system of any sequence to any\nother sequence;\
  \ can also map to or from the coordinate system of the\nentire alignment.  In addition,\
  \ supports translation of coordinates by\nspecified offset.\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -m\
  \ <msa_fname>  (required) Name of file in which alignment is defined.\n    -f <gff_fname>\
  \  (required) Name of file in which features are defined (GFF). \n    -s <src_frame>\
  \  Index of frame of reference for feature coordinates, as \n                  \
  \  defined in the GFF file.  Use an integer 1-N (if N seqs) \n                 \
  \   or 0 to indicate the coordinate system of the alignment \n                 \
  \   as a whole.  Default behavior is to match features with \n                 \
  \   alignment sequences by name (feature by feature).\n    -d <dest_frame> Index\
  \ of destination frame of reference.  Default is 0\n                    (whole MSA).\n\
  \    -p <coord_off>  Positive coordinate offset.  This value will be\n         \
  \           added to all coordinates.  Useful when \n                    the alignment\
  \ (or sequence) for which the coordinates \n                    are specified is\
  \ a sub-alignment of yours. \n    -n <coord_off>  Negative coordinate offset.  This\
  \ value will be\n                    subtracted from all coordinates.  Useful when\
  \ your\n                    alignment is a sub-alignment of the alignment (or \n\
