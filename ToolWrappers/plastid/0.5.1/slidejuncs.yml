  \nCompare splice junctions discovered in a dataset to those in an annotation\nof\
  \ known splice junctions, amending misplaced junctions, and identifying \njunctions\
  \ that fall within repetitive areas of the genome.\n\nKnown splice junctions can\
  \ be misidentified as novel or non-canonical junctions\nwhen intronic sequence immediately\
  \ downstream of the fiveprime splice site\nexactly matches the exonic sequence immediately\
  \ downstream of the threeprime\nsplice site. In fact, the junction point could appear\
  \ anywhere in this\nlocally-repeated region with equal support from sequencing data.\
  \ For example,\nsuppose we have a splice junction as follows::\n\n        \n   \
  \             Exon 1 [0,6)            Intron                                  Exon\
  \ 2 [16,24)\n                ---------------------   --------------------------------------\

  \   A   G   N   N   N   C   T   A   C   T   A   G   A   T   G   G\n    Position\
  \    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18\
  \  19  20  21  22  23\n    Repeated                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\
  \            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n    \nIn this case, the splice junction\
  \ could be moved 3 bases to the left, or\nfour bases to the right, without losing\
  \ consistency with the sequence of\nany cDNA or read alignment covering the junction.\n\
  \   \nTo identify this and other causes of false positive splice junction calls,\n\
  the following operations are performed on each query junction:\n\n    1.  If a mask\
  \ file from crossmap\n        is provided, junctions in which one or more of the\
  \ 5' and 3' splice\n        sites appear in a repetitive region of the genome are\
  \ flagged as\n        non-informative and written to a separate file. \n\n    2.\
  \  For remaining splice junctions, the extent of locally repeated nucleotide\n \
  \       sequence, if any, surrounding the query junction's splice donor and\n  \
  \      acceptor sites, are determined in both the 5' and 3' directions.\n      \
  \  \n        This is the maximum window (*equal-support region*) across which the\n\
  \        actual splice junction could be moved without reducing sequence support.\n\
  \    \n    3.  If there is one or more known splice junctions in this region, the\n\
  \        query junction is assumed to match these, and the known junctions are\n\
  \        reported rather than the query. \n    \n    4.  If (3) is not satisfied,\
  \ and the query junction is a canonical splice\n        junction, it is reported\
  \ as is.\n\n    5.  If (3) is not satisfied, and the query junction represents a\
  \ non-canonical\n        splice junction, the program determines if one or more\
  \ canonical splice\n        junctions is present in the equal-support region. If\
  \ so, these canonical\n        splice junction are reported rather than the query\
  \ junction.\n        \n    6.  If (5) is not satisfied, the non-canonical query\
  \ junction is reported as-is.\n\nOutput files\n------------\nThe following files\
  \ are written, where `OUTBASE` is a string supplied by the\nuser. Scores of splice\
  \ junctions, if present in the input, are ignored.\nEach record in each BED file\
  \ represents a single exon-exon junction, rather\nthan a transcript:\n\n    OUTBASE_repetitive.bed\n\
