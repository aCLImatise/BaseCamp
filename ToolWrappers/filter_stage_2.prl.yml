help_text: "NAME\n    filter-stage-2.prl --- Filter a repeat library by number of\
  \ occurrences\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    cat repeats.lib | ./filter-stage-2.prl --cat=repeats.out\
  \ --thresh=20\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    It is necessary to filter a library of repeats\
  \ based on the number of\n    times each type of repeat element occurs in RepeatMasker\
  \ output.\n\nOPTIONS\n   --cat\n    The RepeatMasker output file. It can either\
  \ be a .cat file or a .out\n    file, but a .out file is preferred.\n\n   --thresh\n\
  \    The number of times a sequence must appear for it to be reported.\n\nNOTES\n\
  \    The Fasta-formatted repeat library must be sent to this program from\n    standard\
  \ input.\n\n    Each entry in the repeat library should be named like so: >name\
  \ then put\n    whatever you want here ATAATG...\n\n    In the RepeatMasker output,\
  \ a given repeat will be listed with \"name\"\n    next to it. Please do not make\
  \ a repeat library where two sequences have\n    the same first word in the \">\"\
  \ header line.\n\n"
