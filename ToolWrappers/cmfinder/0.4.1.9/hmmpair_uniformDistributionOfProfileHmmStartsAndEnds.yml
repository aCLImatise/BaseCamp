  \ format (each line is comma-separated, and the fields are seqId,start,end).  it's\
  \ for masking transcription terminators, and it's assumed to be double-sided, i.e.\
  \ we should ignore a nucleotide if there's a terminator overlapping it, or a rev-comp\
  \ of a terminator overlapping it.  So it doesn't matter if start<end or start>end.\
  \  Each line should have a terminator stem (the lowest coordinate of a paired nucleotide\
  \ and the highest coordinate).  Also pairs within this range are ignored.\n<fragmentary-policy>=d\
  \ means disable, <fragmentary-policy>=f means force fragmentary for calculation\
  \ of covarying base pairs only, <fragmentary-policy>=F means force fragmentary for\
  \ covarying pairs and do the simple hack for training the HMM\nreasonable defaults\
  \ are:\nhmmpair <sto file> 0.05 f 200 0 <partition-func-stuff> <NULL or terminator\
  \ stem predictions if you have them>\nnote: hmmpair only considers the secondary\
  \ structure in the #=GC SS_cons line.  Motif predictions that include pseudoknots\
  \ might benefit from an extended version of hmmpair that considers these additional\
  \ base pairs.\n"
