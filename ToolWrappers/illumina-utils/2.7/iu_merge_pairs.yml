    \ OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX\nOutput file prefix (which will be used as a prefix for\n\
    files that appear in output directory)\n--min-overlap-size INT\nOverlap size must\
    \ exceed this value. Default is 15.\n--max-num-mismatches INT\nMaximum number\
    \ of mismatches at the overlapped region\nto retain the pair. The default behavior\
    \ relies on\n`-P` parameter and does not pay attention to the\nnumber of mismatches\
    \ at the overlapped region.\n--min-qual-score INT  Minimum Q-score for a base\
    \ to overwrite a mismatch at\nthe overlapped region. If there is a mismatch at\
    \ the\noverlapped region, the base with higher quality is\nbeing used in the final\
    \ sequence. Alternatively, if\nthe Q-score of the base with higher quality is\
    \ lower\nthan the Q-score declared with this parameter, that\nbase is being marked\
    \ as an ambiguous base, which may\nresult in the elimination of the merged sequence\n\
    depending on the --ignore-Ns paranmeter. The default\nvalue is 15.\n-P FLOAT \
    \             Any merged sequence with P above the declared value is\ndiscarded\
    \ and stored in a separate file. P is computed\nby dividing the number of mismatches\
    \ at the overlapped\nregion by the length of the overlapped region. For\ninstance,\
    \ if the length of the overlapped region is 30\nnt long, and there are 3 mismatches\
    \ in the overlapped\nregion, P would be 3 / 30 = 0.1. The default value for\n\
    P is 0.300000, however it must be adjusted based on\nthe expected overlap in a\
    \ given study with respect to\ndesired stringency. Stringency can also be adjusted\n\
    using `--max-num-mismatches` parameter, or can be done\npost-merging, using the\
    \ program `filter-merged-reads`.\n--enforce-Q30-check   By default, quality filtering\
    \ is being done based only\non the mismatches found in the overlapped region,\
    \ and\nthe beginning and the end of merged reads are not\nbeing checked. However\
    \ a final control can be enforced\nusing this flag. This flag turns on the Q30\
    \ check, as\nit was explained by Minoche et al. in their 2012\npaper. Briefly,\
    \ Q30-check eliminates pairs if the 66%\nof bases in the first half of each read\
    \ do not have\nQ-scores over Q30. Note that Q30 is applied only to\nthe parts\
    \ of reads that did not overlap. If either of\nreads fail Q30 check, merged sequence\
    \ is discarded.\n--compute-qual-dicts  When set, qual dicts will be computed.\
    \ May take a very\nlong time for datasets with more than a million pairs.\n--retain-only-overlap\n\
    When set, merger will only return the parts of reads\nthat do overlap, and parts\
    \ of reads that do not\noverlap will be trimmed.\n--debug               When set,\
    \ debug messages will be printed\n--ignore-deflines     If FASTQ files are not\
    \ CASAVA outputs, parsing the\nheader info may go wrong. This flag tells the software\n\
    to skip parsing deflines.\n--ignore-Ns           Merged sequences are being eliminated\
    \ if they have any\nambiguous bases. If this parameter is set merged pairs\nwith\
    \ Ns stay in the merged pairs bin.\n--marker-gene-stringent\nFinds the best merge\
    \ going beyond expected \"partial\noverlap\" case for amplicons. Please read the\n\
    description at url https://github.com/meren/illumina-\nutils/issues/1 for details.\n\
    --skip-suffix-trimming\nSome datasets contain both partially and completely\n\
    overlapping reads. `--marker-gene-stringent` would be\nused in that case. Completely\
    \ overlapping reads can\ncontain unwanted adapter sequence at the ends of the\n\
    reads (read 1 adapter at the end of read 2 and read 2\nadapter at the end of read\
    \ 1). By default, these\nadapter suffixes are trimmed from merged reads, and\n\
    non-overlapping parts of the insert are left untouched\nin partially overlapping\
    \ reads (`--retain-only-\noverlap` trims partially overlapping merges). Setting\n\
    this flag leaves adapter suffixes untrimmed.\n--report-r1-prefix    If there is\
    \ a prefix to read 1 specified in the config\nfile, these sequences will be reported\
    \ for merged\nreads when this flag is set. This can be useful if the\nprefix sequence\
    \ has variable bases, such as in a\nunique molecular identifier (UMI).\n--report-r2-prefix\
    \    If there is a prefix to read 2 specified in the config\nfile, these sequences\
    \ will be reported for merged\nreads when this flag is set. This can be useful\
    \ if the\nprefix sequence has variable bases, such as in a\nunique molecular identifier\
    \ (UMI).\n--num-threads INT     This triggers a faster algorithm for merging reads\n\
    with no mismatches in the overlapping region. This can\nonly be used in combination\
    \ with `--max-num-mismatches\n0`. Specify the number of CPU cores that you wish\
    \ to\nuse.\n--distance-metric {hamming,levenshtein}\n"
