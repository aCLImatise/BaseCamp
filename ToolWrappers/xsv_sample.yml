help_text: "Randomly samples CSV data uniformly using memory proportional to the size\
  \ of\nthe sample.\n\nWhen an index is present, this command will use random indexing\
  \ if the sample\nsize is less than 10% of the total number of records. This allows\
  \ for efficient\nsampling such that the entire CSV file is not parsed.\n\nThis command\
  \ is intended to provide a means to sample from a CSV data set that\nis too big\
  \ to fit into memory (for example, for use with commands like 'xsv\nfrequency' or\
  \ 'xsv stats'). It will however visit every CSV record exactly\nonce, which is necessary\
  \ to provide a uniform random sample. If you wish to\nlimit the number of records\
  \ visited, use the 'xsv slice' command to pipe into\n'xsv sample'.\n\nUsage:\n \
  \   xsv sample [options] <sample-size> [<input>]\n    xsv sample --help\n\nCommon\
  \ options:\n    -h, --help             Display this message\n    -o, --output <file>\
  \    Write output to <file> instead of stdout.\n    -n, --no-headers       When\
  \ set, the first row will be consider as part of\n                           the\
  \ population to sample from. (When not set, the\n                           first\
  \ row is the header row and will always appear\n                           in the\
