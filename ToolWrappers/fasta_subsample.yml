  \n        Output a subsample of size <n> of the sequences in a FASTA sequence\n\
  \        file.  By default the sequences will be selected using a random number\n\
  \        generator that is always seeded to 1 resulting in the same subset of\n\
  \        sequences always being output.  You may modify the seed of the random\n\
  \        number generator and hence the selected subset by using the -seed option\n\
  \        or alternatively you may disable it altogether with the -norand option\n\
  \        and just select the first <n> sequences in the file.  If requested, the\n\
  \        remaining sequences will be output to a file named <rest>, which is useful\n\
  \        for cross-validation.\n\n        You can also choose to only output portions\
  \ of each sequence\n        using the -off and -len switches.  If the sequences\
  \ have \n        UCSC BED file headers (e.g., \">chr1:0-99999\"), the headers will\n\
  \        be adjusted to reflect -off and -len.\n\n        Writes to standard output.\n\
