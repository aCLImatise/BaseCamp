- id: num_positions_from_each_split
  doc: Each split may have one or more variable positions. By default, anvi'o will
    report every SNV position found in a given split. This parameter will help you
    to define a cutoff for the maximum number of SNVs to be reported from a split
    (if the number of SNVs is more than the number you declare using this parameter,
    the positions will be randomly subsampled).

- id: min_scatter
  doc: "This one is tricky. If you have N samples in your dataset, a given variable\
    \ position x in one of your splits can split your N samples into `t` groups based\
    \ on the identity of the variation they harbor at position x. For instance, `t`\
    \ would have been 1, if all samples had the same type of variation at position\
    \ x (which would not be very interesting, because in this case position x would\
    \ have zero contribution to a deeper understanding of how these samples differ\
    \ based on variability. When `t` > 1, it would mean that identities at position\
    \ x across samples do differ. But how much scattering occurs based on position\
    \ x when t > 1? If t=2, how many samples ended in each group? Obviously, even\
    \ distribution of samples across groups may tell us something different than uneven\
    \ distribution of samples across groups. So, this parameter filters out any x\
    \ if 'the number of samples in the second largest group' (=scatter) is less than\
    \ -m. Here is an example: let's assume you have 7 samples. While 5 of those have\
    \ AG, 2 of them have TC at position x. This would mean scatter of x is 2. If you\
    \ set -m to 2, this position would not be reported in your output matrix. The\
    \ default value for -m is 0, which means every `x` found in the database and survived\
    \ previous filtering criteria will be reported. Naturally, -m cannot be more than\
    \ half of the number of samples. Please refer to the user documentation if this\
    \ is confusing."
