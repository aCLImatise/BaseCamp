  description: The minimum minbit value. The minbit heuristic provides a mean to set
    a to eliminate weak matches between two amino acid sequences. We learned it from
    ITEP (Benedict MN et al, doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-8), which is a comprehensive
    analysis workflow for pangenomes, and decided to use it in the anvi'o pangenomic
    workflow, as well. Briefly, If you have two amino acid sequences, 'A' and 'B',
    the minbit is defined as 'BITSCORE(A, B) / MIN(BITSCORE(A, A), BITSCORE(B, B))'.
    So the minbit score between two sequences goes to 1 if they are very similar over
    the entire length of the 'shorter' amino acid sequence, and goes to 0 if (1) they
    match over a very short stretch compared even to the length of the shorter amino
    acid sequence or (2) the match betwen sequence identity is low. The default is
    0.5.

    clusters that occur less than the number you set using this parameter from the

  description: Minimum percent identity between the two amino acid sequences for them

    Diamond search results. Because percent identity is not a predictor of a good
    match (since it does not communicate many other important factors such as the
    alignment length between the two sequences and its proportion to the entire length
    of those involved), we suggest you rely on 'minbit' parameter. But you know what?
    Maybe you shouldn't listen to anyone, and experiment on your own! The default
    is 0 percent.
