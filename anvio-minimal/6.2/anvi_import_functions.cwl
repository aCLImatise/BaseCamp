- id: drop_previous_annotations
  doc: Use this flag if you want anvi'o to remove ALL previous functional annotations
    for your genes, and then import the new data. The default behavior will add any
    annotation source into the db incrementally unless there are already annotations
    from this source. In which case, it will first remove previous annotations for
    that source only (i.e., if source X is both in the db and in the incoming annotations
    data, it will replace the content of source X in the db).
