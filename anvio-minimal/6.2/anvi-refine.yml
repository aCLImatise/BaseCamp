- !Flag
  description: If you don't know the bin name you want to work with but if you know
    the split name it contains you can use this parameter to tell anvi'o the split
    name, and so it can find the bin for you automatically. This is something extremely
    difficult for anvi'o to do, but it does it anyway because you.

  description: Skip hierarchical clustering for the splits in the refined bin, if
    you skip clustering you need to provide your own newick formatted tree using --tree
    parameter.

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Often the minimum and maximum values defined for the an entire profile
    database that contains all contigs do not scale well when you wish to work with
    a single bin in the refine mode. For this reason, the default behavior of anvi-refine
    is to ignore min/max values set in the default state. This flag is your way of
    telling anvi'o to not do that, and load the state stored in the profile database
    as is.
  synonyms:
  - --load-full-state
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A TAB-delimited file for an additional view to be used in the interface.
    This file should contain all split names, and values for each of them in all samples.
    Each column in this file must correspond to a sample name. Content of this file
    will be called 'user_view', which will be available as a new item in the 'views'
    combo box in the interface

  - -V

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: ADDITIONAL_VIEW
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A TAB-delimited file for additional layers for splits. The first column
    of this file must be split names, and the remaining columns should be unique attributes.
    The file does not need to contain all split names, or values for each split in
    every column. Anvi'o will try to deal with missing data nicely. Each column in
    this file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.

  description: When declared, this flag tells the interface to split every gene found
    in HMM searches that were performed against non-singlecopy gene HMM profiles into
    their own layer. Please see the documentation for details.

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}

  description: The taxonomic level to use whenever relevant and/or available. The

  description: "During profiling, anvi'o marks positions of single- nucleotide variations\
    \ (SNVs) that originate from places in contigs where coverage values are a bit\
    \ 'sketchy'. If you would like to avoid SNVs in those positions of splits in applicable\
    \ projects you can use this flag, and the interface would hide SNVs that are marked\
    \ as 'outlier' (although it is clearly the best to see everything, no one will\
    \ judge you if you end up using this flag) (plus, there may or may not be some\
    \ historical data on this here: https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/309)."

    the developer said 'well, this is enough testing', and decided to print out results.

  - --dry-run
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: When declared, function calls for genes will not be initialized (therefore
    will be missing from all relevant interfaces or output files). The use of this
    flag may reduce the memory fingerprint and processing time for large datasets.
  synonyms:
  - --skip-init-functions
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: When declared, the attempt to include automatically generated orders
    of items based on additional data is skipped. In case those buggers cause issues
    with your data, and you still want to see your stuff and deal with the other issue
    maybe later.

  description: Port number to use for anvi'o services. If nothing is declared, anvi'o

  description: By default, anvi'o will use your default browser to launch the interactive
    interface. If you would like to use something else than your system default, you
    can provide a full path for an alternative browser using this parameter, and hope
    for the best. For instance we are using this parameter to call Google's experimental
    browser, Canary, which performs better with demanding visualizations.

  description: When the interactive interface is started with this flag, all 'database
    write' operations will be disabled.

  description: The default behavior is to start the local server, and fire up a browser
    that connects to the server. If you have other plans, and want to start the server
    without calling the browser, this is the flag you need.

  description: If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to enter a password
    and interactive interface will be only accessible after entering same password.
    This option is recommended for shared machines like clusters or shared networks
    where computers are not isolated.
