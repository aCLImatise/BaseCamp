  description: "Specify the column ordering of your BLAST report. We add the following\
    \ paramter to our BLAST searches so the output report contains the `qlen` field,\
    \ which is not included by default: `-outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch\
    \ gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore qlen slen'`. You may have used\
    \ a different `-outfmt` paramter, and you should use this parameter to explicitly\
    \ define the column names in your output file. For instance, if you had used the\
    \ parameter mentioned above, then the correct version of this parameter would\
    \ be: \"qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue\
    \ bitscore qlen slen\". Regardless of the BLAST output format, your columns MUST\
    \ contain the following parameters for this program to work properly: 'qseqid',\
    \ 'bitscore', 'length', 'qlen', and 'pident'."

  description: What `proper_pident` threshold do you want to use for filtering out
    sequences whose top bit-score matches have `proper_pident`s less than this threshold?
    We have defined `proper_pident` to be the percentage of the query amino acids
    that both aligned to and were identical to the corresponding matched amino acid.
    Note that the `pident` parameter output by BLAST does not include regions of the
    query sequence unaligned to the matched sequence, whereas `proper_pident` does.
    For example, a sequence that's only half aligned by a match but with 100% identity
    at matched regions has a `pident` of 100 but a `proper_pident` of 50. The default
    is 30.0%.
