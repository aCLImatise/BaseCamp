  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: The directory for SCGs data to be stored (or read from, depending on
    the context). If you leave it as is without specifying anything, anvi'o will set
    up everything in (or try to read things from) a pre- defined default directory.
    The advantage of using the default directory at the time of set up is that every
    user of anvi'o on a computer system will be using a single data directory, but
    then you may need to run the setup program with superuser privileges. If you don't
    have superuser privileges, then you can use this parameter to tell anvi'o the
    location you wish to use to setup your databases. If you are using a program (such
    as `anvi-run-scg-taxonomy` or `anvi-estimate- scg-taxonomy`) you will have to
    use this parameter to tell those programs where your data are.
