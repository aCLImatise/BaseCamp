  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: The directory for SCGs data to be stored (or read from, depending on
    the context). If you leave it as is without specifying anything, anvi'o will set
    up everything in (or try to read things from) a pre- defined default directory.
    The advantage of using the default directory at the time of set up is that every
    user of anvi'o on a computer system will be using a single data directory, but
    then you may need to run the setup program with superuser privileges. If you don't
    have superuser privileges, then you can use this parameter to tell anvi'o the
    location you wish to use to setup your databases. If you are using a program (such
    as `anvi-run-scg-taxonomy` or `anvi-estimate- scg-taxonomy`) you will have to
    use this parameter to tell those programs where your data are.

  description: "Anvi'o will always try to download the latest release, but if there\
    \ is a problem with the latest release, feel free to run setup using a different\
    \ URL. Just to note, anvi'o will expect to find the following files in the URL\
    \ provided here: 'VERSION', 'ar122_msa_individual_genes.tar.gz', 'ar122_taxonomy.tsv',\
    \ 'bac120_msa_individual_genes.tar.gz', and 'bac120_taxonomy.tsv'. If everything\
    \ fails, you can give this URL, which is supposed to work if teh server in which\
    \ these databases are maintained is still online: https://data.ace.uq.edu.au/public/gtdb/data/re\

  description: Remove all the previously stored files and start over. If something
    is feels wrong for some reason and if you believe re-downloading files and setting
    them up could address the issue, this is the flag that will tell anvi'o to act
    like a real computer scientist challenged with a computational problem.
