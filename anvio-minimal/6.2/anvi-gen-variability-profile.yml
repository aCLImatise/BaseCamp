  description: A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be only one column

  description: Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared separated by a delimiter
    (the default is a comma). In anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
    you will get all genes matching your other filtering criteria. In other programs,
    you may get everything, nothing, or an error. It really depends on the situation.
    Fortunately, mistakes are cheap, so it's worth a try.

- !Flag
  description: If provided, your genes of interest will be further subset to only
    include genes with structures in your structure database, and therefore must be
    supplied in conjunction with a structure database, i.e. `-s <your_structure_database>`.
    If you did not specify genes of interest, ALL genes will be subset to those that
    have structures.

  description: Each split may have one or more variable positions. By default, anvi'o
    will report every SNV position found in a given split. This parameter will help
    you to define a cutoff for the maximum number of SNVs to be reported from a split
    (if the number of SNVs is more than the number you declare using this parameter,
    the positions will be randomly subsampled).

  description: Takes a value between 0 and 1, where 1 is maximum divergence from the

  description: Minimum number of samples a nucleotide position should be reported
    as variable. Default is 1. If you set it to 2, for instance, each eligible variable
    position will be expected to appear in at least two samples, which will reduce
    the impact of stochastic, or unintelligible variable positions.

  description: Minimum coverage of a given variable nucleotide position in all samples.
    If a nucleotide position is covered less than this value even in one sample, it
    will be removed from the analysis. Default is 0.
  synonyms:
  - --min-coverage-in-each-sample
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The default behavior is to report base frequencies of nucleotide positions
    only if there is any variation reported during profiling (which by default uses
    some heuristics to minimize the impact of error-driven variation). So, if there
    are 10 samples, and a given position has been reported as a variable site during
    profiling in only one of those samples, there will be no information will be stored
    in the database for the remaining 9. When this flag is used, we go back to each
    sample, and report base frequencies for each sample at this position even if they
    do not vary. It will take considerably longer to report when this flag is on,
    and the use of it will increase the file size dramatically, however it is inevitable
    for some statistical approaches (as well as for some beautiful visualizations).

  description: Use this flag if you would like contig names for each variable position
    to be included in the output file as a column. By default, we do not include contig
    names since they can practically double the output file size without any actual
    benefit in most cases.

  description: If provided, gene coverage statistics will be appended for each entry
    in variability report. This is very useful information, but will not be included
    by default because it is an expensive operation, and may take some additional
    time.
