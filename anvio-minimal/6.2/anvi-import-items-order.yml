  description: PATH, --db-path DB PATH An appropriate anvi'o database to import the
    items order. Currently it can be a profile, pan, or genes database. But you should
    try your chances with other kinds of databases for fun and games. Basically, if
    the database contains an items order table, then things will work. Otherwise,
    you will probably get angry errors back in the worst case scenario.

  description: You have the option to make this order the default order in the database.
    Which means, anvi'o will use this one when someone runs the program anvi- interactive
    and presses draw. Big responsibility. But if you have a 'default' state, it will
    not work because the default items order in the state file overwrites the one
    that comes from the database. So not that big of a responsibility.
