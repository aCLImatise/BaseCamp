  description: A two-column TAB-delimited flat text file that lists anvi'o contigs
    databases. The first item in the header line should read 'name', and the second
    should read 'contigs_db_path'. Each line in the file should describe a single
    entry, where the first column is the name of the genome (or MAG), and the second
    column is the anvi'o contigs database generated for this genome.

  description: NAME Get sequences for a specific list of HMM sources. You can list
    one or more sources by separating them from each other with a comma character
    (i.e., '--hmm- sources source_1,source_2,source_3'). If you would like to see
    a list of available sources in the contigs database, run this program with '--list-hmm-sources'
    flag.
  synonyms:
  - --hmm-sources
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: SOURCE
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: HIT NAME Get sequences only for a specific gene name. Each name should
    be separated from each other by a comma character. For instance, if you want to
    get back only RecA and Ribosomal_L27, you can type '--gene-names RecA,Ribosomal_L27',
    and you will get any and every hit that matches these names in any source. If
    you would like to see a list of available gene names, you can use '--list-available-gene-names'
    flag.

  description: "Some commonly used software for phylogenetic analyses (e.g., IQ-TREE,\
    \ RAxML, etc) allow users to specify/test different substitution models for each\
    \ gene of a concatenated multiple sequence alignments. For this, they use a special\
    \ file format called a 'partition file', which indicates the site for each gene\
    \ in the alignment. You can use this parameter to declare an output path for anvi'o\
    \ to report a NEXUS format partition file in addition to your FASTA output (requested\
    \ by Massimiliano Molari in #1333)."

  description: This filter removes bins (or genomes) from your analysis. If you have
    a list of gene names, you can use this parameter to omit any bin (or external
    genome) that is missing more than a number of genes you desire. For instance,
    if you have 100 genome bins, and you are interested in working with 5 ribosomal
    proteins, you can use '--max-num-genes-missing-from- bin 4' to remove the bins
    that are missing more than 4 of those 5 genes. This is especially useful for phylogenomic
    analyses. Parameter 0 will remove any bin that is missing any of the genes.

  description: This filter removes genes from your analysis. Let's assume you have
    100 bins to get sequences for HMM hits. If you want to work only with genes among
    all the hits that occur in at least X number of bins, and discard the rest of
    them, you can use this flag. If you say '--min-num-bins-gene-occurs 90', each
    gene in the analysis will be required at least to appear in 90 genomes. If a gene
    occurs in less than that number of genomes, it simply will not be reported. This
    is especially useful for phylogenomic analyses, where you may want to only focus
    on genes that are prevalent across the set of genomes you wish to analyze.

  description: A word that will be used to sepaate concatenated gene sequences from
    each other (IF you are using this program with `--concatenate-genes` flag). The
    default is "XXX" for amino acid sequences, and "NNN" for DNA sequences
  synonyms:
  - --separator
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: STRING
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A bin may contain more than one hit for a gene name in a given HMM
    source. For instance, there may be multiple RecA hits in a genome bin from Campbell
    et al.. Using this flag, will go through all of the gene names that appear multiple
    times, and remove all but the one with the lowest e-value. Good for whenever you
    really need to get only a single copy of single-copy core genes from a genome
    bin.
