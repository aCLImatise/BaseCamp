  description: The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering. The default distance
    metric is 'euclidean'. You can find the full list of distance metrics either by
    making a mistake (such as entering a non-existent distance metric and making anvi'o
    upset), or by taking a look at the help menu of the hierarchy.distance.pdist function
    in the scipy.cluster module.

  description: The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering. The default linkage
    method is 'ward', because that is the best one. It really is. We talked to a lot
    of people and they were all like 'this is the best one available' and it is just
    all out there. Honestly it is so good that we will build a wall around it and
    make other linkage methods pay for it. But if you want to see a full list of available
    ones you can check the hierarcy.linkage function in the scipy.cluster module.
    Up to you really. But then you can't use ward anymore, and you would have to leave
    anvi'o right now.
