  description: If you only have contig sequences, but no mapping data (i.e., you found
    a genome and would like to take a look from it), this flag will become very hand.
    After creating a contigs database for your contigs, you can create a blank anvi'o
    profile database to use anvi'o interactive interface with that contigs database
    without any mapping data.

  description: It is important to set a sample name (using only ASCII letters and
    digits and without spaces) that is unique (considering all others). If you do
    not provide one, anvi'o will try to make up one for you based on other information,
    although, you should never let the software to decide these things).
  synonyms:
  - -S
  - --sample-name
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: NAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: One of the things anvi-profile does is to store information about variable
    nucleotide positions. Usually it does not report every variable position, since
    not every variable position is genuine variation. Say, if you have 1,000 coverage,
    and all nucleotides at that position are Ts and only one of them is a C, the confidence
    of that C being a real variation is quite low. anvi'o has a simple algorithm in
    place to reduce the impact of noise. However, using this flag you can disable
    it and ask profiler to report every single variation (which may result in very
    large output files and millions of reports, but you are the boss). Do not forget
    to take a look at '-- min-coverage-for-variability' parameter
  synonyms:
  - --report-variability-full
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, anvi'o characterizes single-nucleotide variation in each
    sample. The use of this flag will instruct profiler to skip that step. Please
    remember that parameters and flags must be identical between different profiles
    using the same contigs database for them to merge properly.
  synonyms:
  - --skip-SNV-profiling
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Anvi'o can perform accurate characterization of codon frequencies in
    genes during profiling. While having codon frequencies opens doors to powerful
    evolutionary insights in downstream analyses, due to its computational complexity,
    this feature comes 'off' by default. Using this flag you can rise against the
    authority, as you always should, and make anvi'o profile codons.

  description: A plain text file that contains some description about the project.
    You can use Markdwon syntax. The description text will be rendered and shown in
    all relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive interface, or anvi'o
    summary outputs.

    name: TEXT_FILE
  optional: true

  description: Single profiles are rarely used for genome binning or visualization,
    and since clustering step increases the profiling runtime for no good reason,
    the default behavior is to not cluster contigs for individual runs. However, if
    you are planning to do binning on one sample, you must use this flag to tell anvi'o
    to run cluster configurations for single runs on your sample.

  - --cluster-contigs
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If you are not planning to use the interactive interface (or if you
    have other means to add a tree of contigs in the database) you may skip the step
    where hierarchical clustering of your items are preformed based on default clustering
    recipes matching to your database type.
  synonyms:
  - --skip-hierarchical-clustering
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true

  description: The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering. Only relevant
    if you are using `--cluster-contigs` flag. The default is "euclidean".

  optional: true

  description: The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering. Just like the distance
    metric this is only relevant if you are using it with `--cluster-contigs` flag.

  description: Minimum length of contigs in a BAM file to analyze. The minimum length
    should be long enough for tetra- nucleotide frequency analysis to be meaningful.
    There is no way to define a golden number of minimum length that would be applicable
    to genomes found in all environments, but we chose the default to be 1000, and
    have been happy with it. You are welcome to experiment, but we advise to never
    go below 1,000. You also should remember that the lower you go, the more time
    it will take to analyze all contigs. You can use --list-contigs parameter to have
    an idea how many contigs would be discarded for a given M.

  - -M

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true

  description: Just like the minimum contig length parameter, but to set a maximum.
    Basically this will remove any contig longer than a certain value. Why would anyone
    need this? Who knows. But if you ever do, it is here.

    name: INT

  description: Minimum mean coverage for contigs to be kept in the analysis. The default
    value is 0, which is for your best interest if you are going to profile multiple
    BAM files which are then going to be merged for a cross- sectional or time series
    analysis. Do not change it if you are not sure this is what you want to do.

  description: Minimum coverage of a nucleotide position to be subjected to SNV profiling.
    By default, anvi'o will not attempt to make sense of variation in a given nucleotide
    position if it is covered less than 10X. You can change that minimum using this
    parameter.

  - -V

  optional: true

  description: It is possible to analyze only a group of contigs from a given BAM
    file. If you provide a text file, in which every contig of interest is listed
    line by line, the profiler would engine only on those contigs in the BAM file
    and ignore the rest. This can be used for debugging purposes, or to engine on
    a particular group of contigs that were identified as relevant during the interactive
    analysis.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: The queue size for worker threads to store data to communicate to the
    main thread. The default is set by the class based on the number of threads. If
    you have *any* hesitation about whether you know what you are doing, you should
    not change this value.

  - --queue-size
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: How many items should be kept in memory before they are written do
    the disk. The default is 500 per thread. So a single-threaded job would have a
    write buffer size of 500, whereas a job with 4 threads would have a write buffer
    size of 4*500. The larger the buffer size, the less frequent the program will
    access to the disk, yet the more memory will be consumed since the processed items
    will be cleared off the memory only after they are written to the disk. The default
    buffer size will likely work for most cases. Please keep an eye on the memory
    usage output to make sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the physical
    memory.
