    if you set --min-alignment-fraction to '0.05', and this parameter to '5000', anvi'o
    will keep hits from alignments that are longer than 5000 nts, EVEN IF THEY REPRESENT
    less than 5 percent of a given genome pair. Basically if --min-alignment-fraction

  description: Usually, percent identity is calculated only over aligned regions,
    and this is what is used as a distance metric by default. But with this flag,
    you can instead use the *full* percent identity as the distance metric. It is
    the same as percent identity, except that regions that did not align are included
    in the calculation. This means *full* percent identity will always be less than
    or equal to percent identity. How is it calculated? Well if P is the percentage
    identity calculated in aligned regions, L is the length of the genome, and A is
    the fraction of the genome that aligned to a compared genome, the full percent
    identity is P * (A/L). In other words, it is the percent identity multiplied by
    the alignment coverage. For example, if the alignment is a whopping 97 percent
    identity but only 8 percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent identity
    is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078, which is just 7.8 percent.

  description: In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates (percent identity

    by considering the *full* percent identity, which includes in its calculation
    regions that did not align. For example, if the alignment is a whopping 97 percent
    identity but only 8 percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent identity
    is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078 OR 7.8 percent. *full* percent identity is always included
    in the report, but you can also use it as a filter for other metrics, such as
    percent identity. This filter will set all ANI measures between two genomes to
    0 if the *full* percent identity is less than you deem trustable. When you set
    a value, anvi'o will go through the ANI results, and set all ANI measures between

  description: If two genomes have a similarity greater than or equal to this threshold,

  \ represent shorter\n                        fractions of genomes, but what if you\
  \ still don't want\n                        to miss an alignment that is longer\
  \ than an X number\n                        of nucleotides regardless of what fraction\
  \ of the\n                        genome it represents? Well, this parameter is\
  \ to\n                        recover things that may be lost due to --min-\n  \
  \                      alignment-fraction parameter. Let's say, if you set\n   \
  \                     --min-alignment-fraction to '0.05', and this parameter\n \
  \                       to '5000', anvi'o will keep hits from alignments that\n\
  \                        are longer than 5000 nts, EVEN IF THEY REPRESENT less\n\
  \                        than 5 percent of a given genome pair. Basically if\n \
  \                       --min-alignment-fraction is your shield to protect\n   \
  \                     yourself from incoming garbage, --significant-\n         \
  \               alignment-length is your chopstick to pick out those\n         \
  \               that may be interesting, and you are a true warrior\n          \
  \              here.\n  --use-full-percent-identity\n                        Usually,\
  \ percent identity is calculated only over\n                        aligned regions,\
  \ and this is what is used as a\n                        distance metric by default.\
  \ But with this flag, you\n                        can instead use the *full* percent\
  \ identity as the\n                        distance metric. It is the same as percent\
  \ identity,\n                        except that regions that did not align are\
  \ included in\n                        the calculation. This means *full* percent\
  \ identity\n                        will always be less than or equal to percent\
  \ identity.\n                        How is it calculated? Well if P is the percentage\n\
  \                        identity calculated in aligned regions, L is the\n    \
  \                    length of the genome, and A is the fraction of the\n      \
  \                  genome that aligned to a compared genome, the full\n        \
  \                percent identity is P * (A/L). In other words, it is\n        \
  \                the percent identity multiplied by the alignment\n            \
  \            coverage. For example, if the alignment is a whopping\n           \
  \             97 percent identity but only 8 percent of the genome\n           \
  \             aligned, the *full* percent identity is 0.970 * 0.080\n          \
  \              = 0.078, which is just 7.8 percent.\n  --min-full-percent-identity\
  \ FULL_PERCENT_IDENTITY\n                        In some cases you may get high\
  \ raw ANI estimates\n                        (percent identity scores) between two\
  \ genomes that\n                        have little to do with each other simply\
  \ because only\n                        a small fraction of their content may be\
  \ aligned. This\n                        can be partly alleviated by considering\
  \ the *full*\n                        percent identity, which includes in its calculation\n\
  \                        regions that did not align. For example, if the\n     \
  \                   alignment is a whopping 97 percent identity but only 8\n   \
  \                     percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent\n      \
  \                  identity is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078 OR 7.8 percent.\n         \
  \               *full* percent identity is always included in the\n            \
  \            report, but you can also use it as a filter for other\n           \
  \             metrics, such as percent identity. This filter will\n            \
  \            set all ANI measures between two genomes to 0 if the\n            \
  \            *full* percent identity is less than you deem\n                   \
  \     trustable. When you set a value, anvi'o will go\n                        through\
  \ the ANI results, and set all ANI measures\n                        between two\
  \ genomes to 0 if the *full* percent\n                        identity *between\
  \ either of them* is less than the\n                        parameter described\
  \ here. The default is 20.\n\nsourmash settings:\n  Tell anvi'o to run sourmash\
  \ with specific settings. Only if `--program` is\n  set to `sourmash`\n\n  --kmer-size\
  \ INT       Set the k-mer size for mash similarity checks. The\n               \
  \         default is 13.\n  --scale INT           Set the compression ratio for\
  \ fasta signature file\n                        computations. The default is 1000.\
  \ Smaller ratios\n                        decrease sensitivity, while larger ratios\
  \ will lead to\n                        large fasta signatures.\n\nDereplication\
  \ Parameters:\n  Some parameters to guide your dereplication\n\n  --similarity-threshold\
  \ SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD\n                        If two genomes have a similarity\
  \ greater than or equal\n                        to this threshold, they will belong\
  \ to the same\n                        cluster. Since measures of 'similarity' depend\n\
  \                        strongly on what method is used for calculation, and\n\
  \                        since the threshold at which two genomes should be\n  \
  \                      considered 'similar enough' to be considered redundant\n\
  \                        will depend on the application, anvi'o refuses to\n   \
  \                     provide a default parameter. If you're using pyANI,\n    \
  \                    maybe 0.90 is what you're after. If you're using\n        \
  \                sourmash, maybe 0.25 is what you're after. Or maybe\n         \
  \               not? Anvi'o is feeling nervous about this decision.\n  --cluster-method\
  \ {simple_greedy}\n                        Currently, genomes are clustered based\
  \ on a simple\n                        greedy algorithm. Let's say your similarity\
  \ threshold\n                        is 0.90. If genome A is 0.95 similar to B,\
  \ and B is\n                        0.95 similar to C, and C is 0.95 similar to\
  \ D, then\n                        {A,B,C,D} will form a cluster. This is *even\
  \ though* D\n                        may share a similarity to A of merely 0.80,\
  \ which is\n                        below similarity threshold. You want better\n\
  \                        alternatives? Contact the developers.\n  --representative-method\
  \ {Qscore,length,centrality}\n                        After genomes are grouped\
  \ into redundancy clusters,\n                        you can define how anvi'o picks\
  \ the representative\n                        genome from the cluster. 'Qscore'\
  \ computes the genome\n                        with the highest completion and lowest\
  \ redundancy as\n                        the representative. 'length' returns the\
  \ longest\n                        genome. 'centrality' returns the genome with\
  \ the\n                        highest average similarity to everything in the\n\
  \                        cluster, i.e. the most central. The default is\n      \
  \                  centrality\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT STUFF:\n  Yes. You're almost done.\n\
