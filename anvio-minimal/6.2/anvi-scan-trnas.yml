  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.
