- id: contigs_db
  doc: Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen- contigs'
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --contigs-db
- id: cog_data_dir
  doc: The directory path for your COG setup. Anvi'o will try to use the default path
    if you do not specify anything.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --cog-data-dir
- id: num_threads
  doc: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible. Very
    conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of
    CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you are
    running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --num-threads
- id: sensitive
  doc: DIAMOND sensitivity. With this flag you can instruct DIAMOND to be 'sensitive',
    rather than 'fast' during the search. It is likely the search will take remarkably
    longer. But, hey, if you are doing it for your final analysis, maybe it should
    take longer and be more accurate. This flag is only relevant if you are running
    DIAMOND.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --sensitive
- id: temporary_dir_path
  doc: If you don't provide anything here, this program will come up with a temporary
    directory path by itself to store intermediate files, and clean it later. If you
    want to have full control over this, you can use this flag to define one..
  type: File
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --temporary-dir-path
- id: search_with
  doc: 'What program to use for database searching. The default search uses blastp.
    All available options include: blastp.'
