  description: A file with anvi'o gene caller IDs. There should be only one column
    in the file, and each line should correspond to a unique gene caller id (without
    a column header).

    name: FILE
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Gene caller ids. Multiple of them can be declared separated by a delimiter
    (the default is a comma). In anvi-gen-variability-profile, if you declare nothing
    you will get all genes matching your other filtering criteria. In other programs,
    you may get everything, nothing, or an error. It really depends on the situation.
    Fortunately, mistakes are cheap, so it's worth a try.

  description: Modeling and annotating structures requires a lot of moving parts,
    each which have their own outputs. The output of this program is a structure database
    containing the pertinent results of this computation, however a lot of stuff doesn't
    make the cut. By providing a directory for this parameter you will get, in addition
    to the structure database, a directory containing the raw output for everything.

  description: Since you are updating an existing DB, modeller params are set in place.
    You can have this program list them by providing this flag

    of interest if they are already present in your DB

  description: The MODELLER program to use. For example, `mod9.19`. Anvi'o will try
    and find it if not provided.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  - -T
  - --num-threads
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: NUM_THREADS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: How many items should be kept in memory before they are written do
    the disk. The default is 25 per thread. So a single-threaded job would have a
    write buffer size of 25, whereas a job with 4 threads would have a write buffer
    size of 4*25. The larger the buffer size, the less frequent the program will access
    to the disk, yet the more memory will be consumed since the processed items will
    be cleared off the memory only after they are written to the disk. The default
    buffer size will likely work for most cases. Please keep an eye on the memory
    usage output to make sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the physical
    memory. If --num-threads is 1, this parameter is ignored because the DB is written
    to after each gene
