  doc: Anvi'o profile database
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --profile-db
- id: contigs_db
  doc: Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen- contigs'
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --contigs-db
- id: output_dir
  doc: Directory path for output files
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --output-dir
- id: output_file_prefix
  doc: A prefix to be used while naming the output files (no file type extensions
    please; just a prefix).
  type: File
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --output-file-prefix
- id: splits_mode
  doc: Specify this flag if you would like to output coverages of individual 'splits',
    rather than their 'parent' contig coverages.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --splits-mode
- id: report_contigs
  doc: By default this program reports sequences and their coverages for 'splits'.
    By using this flag, you can report contig sequences and coverages instead. For
    obvious reasons, you can't use this flag with `--splits-mode` flag.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --report-contigs
- id: use_q_two_q_three_coverages
  doc: By default this program reports the mean coverage of a split (or contig, see
    --report-contigs) for each sample. By using this flag, you can report the mean
    Q2Q3 coverage by excluding 25 percent of the nucleotide positions with the smallest
    coverage values, and 25 percent of the nucleotide positions with the largest coverage
    values. The hope is that this removes 'outlier' positions resulting from non-
    specific mapping, etc. that skew the mean coverage estimate.
  type: boolean
