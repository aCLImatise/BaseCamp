  description: This filter will remove gene clusters from your report. Let's assume
    you have 100 genomes in your pan genome analysis. You can use this parameter if
    you want to work only with gene clusters that occur in at least X number of genomes.
    If you say '--min-num- genomes-gene-cluster-occurs 90', each gene cluster in the
    analysis will be required at least to appear in 90 genomes. If a gene occurs in
    less than that number of genomes, it simply will not be reported. This is especially
    useful for phylogenomic analyses, where you may want to only focus on gene clusters
    that are prevalent across the set of genomes you wish to analyze.

  \              the items additional data table, its contents will be\n         \
