  doc: Print a list of the dependencies of this workflow. You must provide a workflow
    name and a config file. snakemake will figure out which rules need to be run according
    to your config file, and according to the files available on your disk. According
    to the rules that need to be run, we will let you know which programs are going
    to be used, so that you can make sure you have all of them installed and loaded.
