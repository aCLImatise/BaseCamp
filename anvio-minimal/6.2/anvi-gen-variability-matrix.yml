  description: Each split may have one or more variable positions. By default, anvi'o
    will report every SNV position found in a given split. This parameter will help
    you to define a cutoff for the maximum number of SNVs to be reported from a split
    (if the number of SNVs is more than the number you declare using this parameter,
    the positions will be randomly subsampled).

  description: "This one is tricky. If you have N samples in your dataset, a given\
    \ variable position x in one of your splits can split your N samples into `t`\
    \ groups based on the identity of the variation they harbor at position x. For\
    \ instance, `t` would have been 1, if all samples had the same type of variation\
    \ at position x (which would not be very interesting, because in this case position\
    \ x would have zero contribution to a deeper understanding of how these samples\
    \ differ based on variability. When `t` > 1, it would mean that identities at\
    \ position x across samples do differ. But how much scattering occurs based on\
    \ position x when t > 1? If t=2, how many samples ended in each group? Obviously,\
    \ even distribution of samples across groups may tell us something different than\
    \ uneven distribution of samples across groups. So, this parameter filters out\
    \ any x if 'the number of samples in the second largest group' (=scatter) is less\
    \ than -m. Here is an example: let's assume you have 7 samples. While 5 of those\
    \ have AG, 2 of them have TC at position x. This would mean scatter of x is 2.\
    \ If you set -m to 2, this position would not be reported in your output matrix.\
    \ The default value for -m is 0, which means every `x` found in the database and\
    \ survived previous filtering criteria will be reported. Naturally, -m cannot\
    \ be more than half of the number of samples. Please refer to the user documentation\
    \ if this is confusing."
