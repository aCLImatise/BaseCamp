  description: A two-column TAB-delimited flat text file that lists anvi'o contigs
    databases. The first item in the header line should read 'name', and the second
    should read 'contigs_db_path'. Each line in the file should describe a single
    entry, where the first column is the name of the genome (or MAG), and the second
    column is the anvi'o contigs database generated for this genome.
