help_text: "\nUsage:\nperl annotateBed.pl [Options] bed/gff_file summary_file.txt\
  \ --anno feature_bed_file_dir\n\n This script use BEDtools to annotate bed file\
  \ with multiple genomic features, with percentage overlap, within same strand, reverse\
  \ strand or both.\n it extend BEDtools to allow count from 5'end, 3'end, both border\
  \ or center of bed. it also allows different upstream and downstream. \n it will\
  \ generate summary files that count how many regions are overlapped with each feature(p\
  \ value using hypergenomitric test), \n how many features are in this region(p value\
  \ using hypergenomitric test)\n\n  bed/gff_file     Input bed/gff file which requires\
  \ the annotation.\n  summary_file.txt     Summary statistics about annotation result.\n\
  \n  [Options]:\n\n  --anno FILE : genomic features' bed files, which are used to\
  \ annotate input bed files, allow multiple files\n\n  --genome FILE : genome fasta\
  \ index file, used to generate random number in each of the chromosome\n\n  --upstream\
  \ NUM :  how many bp upstream from  align start position (Default: 0)\n\n  --downstream\
  \ NUM :   how many bp downstream from  align start position (Default: 0)\n\n  --overlap_only\
  \ : only genomic feature overlapped with .bed region will be taken into account\n\
  \n  --overlap_percentage NUM :  minimum percentage of .bed regions overlapped with\
  \ genomic features will be taken into account (Default: 0)\n\n  --same_strand :\
  \ Require same strandedness.  That is, only counts overlaps on the _same_ strand\
  \ (Default: both strand).\n\n  --reverse_strand : Require different strandedness.\
  \  That is, only count overlaps on the _opposite_ strand (Default: both strand).\n\
  \n  --bedtools_path : path to BEDtools/bin/.if not specified in PATH environment\
  \ variable\n\n  --align_start NUM : (Default: --align_start 1)\n               \
  \  1) extend upstream, downstream from both of 5', 3' border\n                 2)\
  \ extend upstream, downstream from 5' border\n                 3) extend upstream,\
  \ downstream from 3' border\n                 4) extend upstream, downstream from\
  \ center of .bed region\n"
