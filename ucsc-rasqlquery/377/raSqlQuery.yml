  \ where field='this'\"\nThe queryFile just has a query in it in the same form as\
  \ the query option.\nThe syntax of a query statement is very SQL-like. The most\
  \ common commands are:\n    select tag1,tag2,tag3 where tag1 like 'prefix%'\nwhere\
  \ the % is a SQL wildcard.  Sorry to mix wildcards. Another command query is\n \
  \   select count(*) from * where tag = 'val\nThe from list is optional.  If it exists\
  \ it is a list of raFile names\n    select track,type from *Encode* where type like\

  \ where record is defined\n   -addDb - Add 'db' field to say where record is defined\n\
