    Also, if repetitive regions were not included in the mapping of reads, the effective
    genome size needs to be adjusted accordingly. A table of values is available here:

  description: 'Use one of the entered methods to normalize the number of reads per
    bin. By default, no normalization is performed. RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase per
    Million mapped reads; CPM = Counts Per Million mapped reads, same as CPM in RNA-seq;
    BPM = Bins Per Million mapped reads, same as TPM in RNA-seq; RPGC = reads per
    genomic content (1x normalization); Mapped reads are considered after blacklist
    filtering (if applied). RPKM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / (number of
    mapped reads (in millions) * bin length (kb)). CPM (per bin) = number of reads
    per bin / number of mapped reads (in millions). BPM (per bin) = number of reads
    per bin / sum of all reads per bin (in millions). RPGC (per bin) = number of reads
    per bin / scaling factor for 1x average coverage. None = the default and equivalent
    to not setting this option at all. This scaling factor, in turn, is determined
    from the sequencing depth: (total number of mapped reads * fragment length) /
    effective genome size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the sequencing
    depth computed for the sample to match the 1x coverage. This option requires --effectiveGenomeSize.
    Each read is considered independently, if you want to only count one mate from
    a pair in paired-end data, then use the --samFlagInclude/--samFlagExclude options.

  description: 'Instead of computing scaling factors based on a sampling of the reads,

    accurate scaling factors in cases where alignments that are being filtered are
    rare and lumped together. In other words, this is only needed when region-based

  description: '[INT bp], -e [INT bp] This parameter allows the extension of reads

    it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single- end*: Requires a user specified
    value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length
    will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match
    the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that
    map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are
    treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional.
