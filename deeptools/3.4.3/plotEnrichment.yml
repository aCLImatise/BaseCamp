  description: '[INT bp], -e [INT bp] This parameter allows the extension of reads
    to fragment size. If set, each read is extended, without exception. *NOTE*: This
    feature is generally NOT recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as
    it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single- end*: Requires a user specified
    value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length
    will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match
    the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that
    map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are
    treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional.
    If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment
    size of all mate reads).'

  \ or GROseq, where\n                        the signal is 12, 15 or 0 bases past\
  \ the start of the\n                        read. This can be paired with the --filterRNAstrand\n\
  \                        option. Note that negative values indicate offsets\n  \
  \                      from the end of each read. A value of 1 indicates the\n \
  \                       first base of the alignment (taking alignment\n        \
  \                orientation into account). Likewise, a value of -1 is\n       \

  \                  permitted. If two values are specified, then they will\n    \
  \                    be used to specify a range of positions. Note that\n      \
  \                  specifying something like --Offset 5 -1 will result in\n    \
  \                    the 5th through last position being used, which is\n      \
  \                  equivalent to trimming 4 bases from the 5-prime end of\n    \
