  \ the end of the regions.\n                        (Default: mean)\n  --sortUsingSamples\
  \ SORTUSINGSAMPLES [SORTUSINGSAMPLES ...]\n                        List of sample\
  \ numbers (order as in matrix), that are\n                        used for sorting\
  \ by --sortUsing, no value uses all\n                        samples, example: --sortUsingSamples\
  \ 1 3 (default:\n                        None)\n  --averageTypeBins {mean,median,min,max,std,sum}\n\
  \                        Define the type of statistic that should be used over\n\
  \                        the bin size range. The options are: \"mean\", \"median\"\
  ,\n                        \"min\", \"max\", \"sum\" and \"std\". The default is\
  \ \"mean\".\n                        (Default: mean)\n  --missingDataAsZero   If\
  \ set, missing data (NAs) will be treated as zeros.\n                        The\
  \ default is to ignore such cases, which will be\n                        depicted\
  \ as black areas in a heatmap. (see the\n                        --missingDataColor\
  \ argument of the plotHeatmap command\n                        for additional options).\
  \ (default: False)\n  --skipZeros           Whether regions with only scores of\
  \ zero should be\n                        included or not. Default is to include\
  \ them. (default:\n                        False)\n  --minThreshold MINTHRESHOLD\n\
  \                        Numeric value. Any region containing a value that is\n\
  \                        less than or equal to this will be skipped. This is\n \
  \                       useful to skip, for example, genes where the read\n    \
  \                    count is zero for any of the bins. This could be the\n    \
  \                    result of unmappable areas and can bias the overall\n     \
  \                   results. (Default: None)\n  --maxThreshold MAXTHRESHOLD\n  \
  \                      Numeric value. Any region containing a value greater\n  \
  \                      than or equal to this will be skipped. The\n            \
  \            maxThreshold is useful to skip those few regions with\n           \
  \             very high read counts (e.g. micro satellites) that may\n         \
  \               bias the average values. (Default: None)\n  --blackListFileName\
  \ BED file, -bl BED file\n                        A BED file containing regions\
  \ that should be excluded\n                        from all analyses. Currently\
  \ this works by rejecting\n                        genomic chunks that happen to\
  \ overlap an entry.\n                        Consequently, for BAM files, if a read\
  \ partially\n                        overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment\
  \ spans over\n                        it, then the read/fragment might still be\
  \ considered.\n                        (default: None)\n  --samplesLabel SAMPLESLABEL\
  \ [SAMPLESLABEL ...]\n                        Labels for the samples. This will\
  \ then be passed to\n                        plotHeatmap and plotProfile. The default\
  \ is to use the\n                        file name of the sample. The sample labels\
  \ should be\n                        separated by spaces and quoted if a label\n\
  \                        itselfcontains a space E.g. --samplesLabel label-1\n  \
  \                      \"label 2\" (default: None)\n  --smartLabels         Instead\
  \ of manually specifying labels for the input\n                        bigWig and\
  \ BED/GTF files, this causes deepTools to use\n                        the file\
  \ name after removing the path and extension.\n                        (default:\
  \ False)\n  --quiet, -q           Set to remove any warning or processing messages.\n\
  \                        (default: False)\n  --verbose             Being VERY verbose\
  \ in the status messages. --quiet\n                        will disable this. (default:\
  \ False)\n  --scale SCALE         If set, all values are multiplied by this number.\n\
  \                        (Default: 1)\n  --numberOfProcessors INT, -p INT\n    \
  \                    Number of processors to use. Type \"max/2\" to use half\n \
  \                       the maximum number of processors or \"max\" to use all\n\
  \                        available processors. (Default: 1)\n\nGTF/BED12 options:\n\
  \  --metagene            When either a BED12 or GTF file are used to provide\n \
  \                       regions, perform the computation on the merged exons,\n\
  \                        rather than using the genomic interval defined by the\n\
  \                        5-prime and 3-prime most transcript bound (i.e.,\n    \
  \                    columns 2 and 3 of a BED file). If a BED3 or BED6 file\n  \
  \                      is used as input, then columns 2 and 3 are used as an\n \
  \                       exon. (Default: False)\n  --transcriptID TRANSCRIPTID\n\
  \                        When a GTF file is used to provide regions, only\n    \
  \                    entries with this value as their feature (column 3)\n     \
  \                   will be processed as transcripts. (Default:\n              \
  \          transcript)\n  --exonID EXONID       When a GTF file is used to provide\
  \ regions, only\n                        entries with this value as their feature\
  \ (column 3)\n                        will be processed as exons. CDS would be another\n\
  \                        common value for this. (Default: exon)\n  --transcript_id_designator\
  \ TRANSCRIPT_ID_DESIGNATOR\n                        Each region has an ID (e.g.,\
  \ ACTB) assigned to it,\n                        which for BED files is either column\
  \ 4 (if it exists)\n                        or the interval bounds. For GTF files\
  \ this is instead\n                        stored in the last column as a key:value\
  \ pair (e.g.,\n                        as 'transcript_id \"ACTB\"', for a key of\
  \ transcript_id\n                        and a value of ACTB). In some cases it\
  \ can be\n                        convenient to use a different identifier. To do\
  \ so,\n                        set this to the desired key. (Default: transcript_id)\n\

  \ files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on\n                        deepBlue, this\
  \ specifies the server URL. The default\n                        is \"http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc\"\
  , which\n                        should not be changed without good reason. (default:\n\
  \                        http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc)\n  --userKey USERKEY\
  \     For remote files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on\n                       \
  \ deepBlue, this specifies the user key to use for\n                        access.\
  \ The default is \"anonymous_key\", which suffices\n                        for\
  \ public datasets. If you need access to a\n                        restricted access/private\
  \ dataset, then request a key\n                        from deepBlue and specify\
