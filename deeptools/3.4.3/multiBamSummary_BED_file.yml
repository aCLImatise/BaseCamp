    \ computes the read coverages for genomic regions for typically two or more BAM\

    \ only, use the ``BED-file`` mode instead.\nThe standard output of ``multiBamSummary``\
    \ is a compressed numpy array (``.npz``).\nIt can be directly used to calculate\
    \ and visualize pairwise correlation values between the read coverages using the\
    \ tool 'plotCorrelation'.\nSimilarly, ``plotPCA`` can be used for principal component\
    \ analysis of the read coverages using the .npz file.\nNote that using a single\

  \ --samFlagExclude INT  Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to\n \

  \                     --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for\n      \

  \        rather than using the genomic interval defined by the\n               \

  \     columns 2 and 3 of a BED file). If a BED3 or BED6 file\n                 \
  \       is used as input, then columns 2 and 3 are used as an\n                \
