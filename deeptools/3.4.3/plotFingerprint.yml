  description: '[INT bp], -e [INT bp] This parameter allows the extension of reads
    to fragment size. If set, each read is extended, without exception. *NOTE*: This
    feature is generally NOT recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as
    it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single- end*: Requires a user specified
    value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length
    will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match
    the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that
    map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are
    treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional.
    If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment
    size of all mate reads). (default: False)'

    by the two ends of the fragment. For single-end data, the given fragment length
    is used. This option is useful to get a sharper signal around enriched regions.
