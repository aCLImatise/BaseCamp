  description: The filter to apply to reads in the archive.  If reads match the filter
    they are dumped. The filter takes the form of <name>=<value>, where <name> can
    be "read", "prefix", "file". If the <name> is "read" the value is represents the
    name of a read to dump.  Only the matching read will be dumped. If the <name>
    is "prefix" the value is represents the prefix of the name of the reads to dump.  Only
    the matching reads will be dumped. If the <name> is "file" the value is a file
    name where any number of "read" and "prefix" name value pairs can be included,
    one per line. The default is no filter, which means all reads are dumped.
