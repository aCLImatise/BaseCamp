help_text: "\nBismark Methylation Consistency Module\n======================================\n\
  \nSYNOPSIS\n\nThis program takes in a BAM file generated by Bismark and splits it\
  \ into three smaller BAM files\nbased on the consistency of the methylation calls\
  \ within the file. The reads are split into those\nwhich show consistent methylation,\
  \ consistent unmethylation and mixed methylation. Only methylation\nin CpG context\
  \ is considered. In its default condition, reads are considered as: \n\nunmethylated\
  \  0 -  10% methylated (inclusive)\nmixed:       10 -  90% methylated\nmethylated:\
  \  90 - 100% methylated (inclusive)\n\n\nUSAGE:\n\nmethylation_consistency [OPTIONS]\
  \ [BAM file(s)] \n\nOPTIONS:\n\n--min-count -m          Set the minumum number of\
  \ CpGs which need to be present for a read to be considered at all\n           \
  \             [Default: 5]. Reads with fewer CpGs than this will be discarded.\n\
  \n-s/--single_end         Input files will be treated as single-end Bismark BAM\
  \ files. Default: [AUTO-DETECT]\n\n-p/--paired_end         Input files will be treated\
  \ as paired-end Bismark BAM files. Default: [AUTO-DETECT]\n\n--samtools_path [path]\
  \  The path to your Samtools installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/. Does not need\
  \ to\n                        be specified explicitly if Samtools is in the PATH\
  \ already\n\n--lower_threshold [INT] Percentage value up to which a read is considered\
  \ (fully) un-methylated. [Default: 10].\n\n--upper_threshold [INT] Percentage value\
  \ above which a read is considered (fully) methylated. [Default: 90].\n\n--version\
  \               Print version information and exit\n\n--help                  Print\
