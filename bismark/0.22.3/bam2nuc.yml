help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n      \n  This script bam2nuc reads BAM files and calculates\
  \ the mono- and di-nucleotide coverage of the\n  reads (using the genomic sequence\
  \ rather than the observed sequence in the reads themselves)\n  and compares it\
  \ to the average genomic sequence composition. Reads harbouring InDels, skipped\
  \ or\n  soft-clipped reagions (CIGAR operations N or S) are not taken into consideration.\
  \ Mono- or dinucleotides\n  containing Ns are ignored as well.\n\n  bam2nuc handles\
  \ both Bismark single-end and paired-end files (determined automatically). Both\
  \ \n  BAM and CRAM files should work as input, but please note that Samtools version\
  \ 1.2 or higher is\n  required for CRAM files.\n\n\n  USAGE: bam2nuc [options] --genome_folder\
  \ <path> [input.(bam|cram)]\n\n\n--dir                       Output directory. Output\
  \ is written to the current directory if not specified explicitly.\n\n--genome_folder\
  \ <path>      Enter the genome folder you wish to use to extract sequences from\
  \ (full path only). Accepted\n                            formats are FastA files\
  \ ending with '.fa' or '.fasta', or their gzipped versions (ending in .gz).\n  \
  \                          Specifying a genome folder path is mandatory.\n\n--samtools_path\
  \             The path to your Samtools installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/.\
  \ Does not need to be specified\n                            explicitly if Samtools\
  \ is in the PATH already\n\n--genomic_composition_only  Only calculate and extract\
  \ the genomic sequence composition and exit thereafter. This option will\n     \
  \                       attempt to write the genomic composition table 'genomic_nucleotide_frequencies.txt'\
  \ to the genome\n                            folder or to the output directory instead\
  \ if that doesn't succeed.\n\n--help                      Displays this help message\
  \ and exits\n\n\nGENOMIC composition\n===================\n\nSince the calculation\
  \ of the average genomic (di-)nucleotide composition may take a while bam2nuc attempts\
  \ to\nwrite out a file called 'genomic_nucleotide_frequencies.txt' to the genome\
  \ folder if it wasn't there already. The \nnext time bam2nuc is run it will then\
  \ use this file instead of calculating the average genome composition again. If\n\
  writing to the genome folder fails (e.g. because of permission issues) it will be\
  \ written out to the output directory\ninstead.\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n=============\n\
  \nbam2nuc writes out a file ending in .nucleotide_stats.txt in the following format\
  \ (tab-delimited):\n\n\n(di-)nucleotide count sample    percent sample  count genomic\
