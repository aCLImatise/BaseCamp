help_text: "\t\t====== CD-HIT version 4.5.4 (built on Jun 23 2018) ======\n\nUsage:\
  \ cd-hit-est [Options] \n\nOptions\n\n    -i\tinput filename in fasta format, required\n\
  \    -o\toutput filename, required\n    -c\tsequence identity threshold, default\
  \ 0.9\n \tthis is the default cd-hit's \"global sequence identity\" calculated as:\n\
  \ \tnumber of identical amino acids in alignment\n \tdivided by the full length\
  \ of the shorter sequence\n    -G\tuse global sequence identity, default 1\n \t\
  if set to 0, then use local sequence identity, calculated as :\n \tnumber of identical\
  \ amino acids in alignment\n \tdivided by the length of the alignment\n \tNOTE!!!\
  \ don't use -G 0 unless you use alignment coverage controls\n \tsee options -aL,\
  \ -AL, -aS, -AS\n    -b\tband_width of alignment, default 20\n    -M\tmemory limit\
  \ (in MB) for the program, default 800; 0 for unlimitted;\n    -T\tnumber of threads,\
  \ default 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used\n    -n\tword_length, default 10, see\
  \ user's guide for choosing it\n    -l\tlength of throw_away_sequences, default\
  \ 10\n    -d\tlength of description in .clstr file, default 20\n \tif set to 0,\
  \ it takes the fasta defline and stops at first space\n    -s\tlength difference\
  \ cutoff, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the shorter sequences need to be\n \tat\
  \ least 90% length of the representative of the cluster\n    -S\tlength difference\
  \ cutoff in amino acid, default 999999\n \tif set to 60, the length difference between\
  \ the shorter sequences\n \tand the representative of the cluster can not be bigger\
  \ than 60\n    -aL\talignment coverage for the longer sequence, default 0.0\n \t\
  if set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90% of the sequence\n    -AL\talignment\
  \ coverage control for the longer sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and\
  \ the length of the sequence is 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60)\
  \ residues\n    -aS\talignment coverage for the shorter sequence, default 0.0\n\
  \ \tif set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90% of the sequence\n    -AS\talignment\
  \ coverage control for the shorter sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60,\
  \ and the length of the sequence is 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60)\
  \ residues\n    -A\tminimal alignment coverage control for the both sequences, default\
  \ 0\n \talignment must cover >= this value for both sequences \n    -uL\tmaximum\
  \ unmatched percentage for the longer sequence, default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1, the\
  \ unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more than\
  \ 10% of the sequence\n    -uS\tmaximum unmatched percentage for the shorter sequence,\
  \ default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing\
  \ gaps)\n \tmust not be more than 10% of the sequence\n    -U\tmaximum unmatched\
  \ length, default 99999999\n \tif set to 10, the unmatched region (excluding leading\
  \ and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more than 10 bases\n    -B\t1 or 0, default\
  \ 0, by default, sequences are stored in RAM\n \tif set to 1, sequence are stored\
  \ on hard drive\n \tit is recommended to use -B 1 for huge databases\n    -p\t1\
  \ or 0, default 0\n \tif set to 1, print alignment overlap in .clstr file\n    -g\t\
  1 or 0, default 0\n \tby cd-hit's default algorithm, a sequence is clustered to\
  \ the first \n \tcluster that meet the threshold (fast cluster). If set to 1, the\
  \ program\n \twill cluster it into the most similar cluster that meet the threshold\n\
  \ \t(accurate but slow mode)\n \tbut either 1 or 0 won't change the representatives\
  \ of final clusters\n    -r\t1 or 0, default 1, by default do both +/+ & +/- alignments\n\
  \ \tif set to 0, only +/+ strand alignment\n    -match\tmatching score, default\
  \ 2 (1 for T-U and N-N)\n    -mismatch\tmismatching score, default -2\n    -gap\t\
  gap opening score, default -6\n    -gap-ext\tgap extension score, default -1\n \
