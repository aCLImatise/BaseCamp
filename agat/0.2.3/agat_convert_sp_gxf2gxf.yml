  description: When the features do not have Parent/ID relationships, the parser will
    try to group features using a common/shared attribute (i.e. a locus tag.). By
    default locus_tag and gene_id. You can provide another specific common/shared
    attribute using this option.

  description: 'If you want to see, add or modified the feature relationships you
    will have to use this option. It will copy past in you working directory the json
    files used to define the relation between feature types and their level organisation.
    Typical level organisation: Level1 => gene; Level2 => mRNA; level3 => exon,cds,utrs
    If you get warning from the Omniscient parser that a feature relationship is not
    defined, you can provide information about it within the exposed json files. Indeed,
    if the json files exists in your working directory, they will be used by default.'

  description: Merge loci parameter, default deactivated. You turn on the parameter
    if you want to merge loci into one locus when they overlap. (at CDS level for
    mRNA, at exon level for other level2 features. Strand has to be the same). Prokaryote
    can have overlaping loci so it should not use it for prokaryote annotation. In
    eukaryote, loci rarely overlap. Overlaps could be due to error in the file, mRNA
    can be merged under the same parent gene if you acticate the option.
