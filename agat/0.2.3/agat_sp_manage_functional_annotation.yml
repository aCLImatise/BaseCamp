  description: The PE (protein existence) in the uniprot header indicates the type
    of evidence that supports the existence of the protein. You can decide until which
    protein existence level you want to consider to lift the finctional information.
    Default 5. 1. Experimental evidence at protein level 2. Experimental evidence
    at transcript level 3. Protein inferred from homology 4. Protein predicted 5.

  description: This option will changed the id name. It will create from id prefix
    (usually 6 letters) given as input, uniq IDs like prefixE00000000001. Where E
    mean exon. Instead E we can have C for CDS, G for gene, T for mRNA, U for Utr.
    In the case of discontinuous features (i.e. a single feature that exists over
    multiple genomic locations) the same ID may appear on multiple lines. All lines
    that share an ID collectively represent a signle feature.

  description: This option (id all uniq) is similar to -id option but Id of features
    that share an ID collectively will be change by different and uniq ID.

  description: Usefull only if -id is used. This option is used to define the number
