- id: genome
  doc: That input is design to know the genome size in order to calculate the percentage
    of the genome represented by each kind of feature type. You can provide an INTEGER
    or the genome in fasta format. If you provide the fasta, the genome size will
    be calculated on the fly.
  type: boolean

- id: inflate
  doc: 'Inflate the statistics taking into account feature with multi-parents. Indeed
    to avoid redundant information, some gff factorize identical features. e.g: one
    exon used in two different isoform will be defined only once, and will have multiple
    parent. By default the script count such feature only once. Using the inflate
    option allows to count the feature and its size as many time there are parents.'

    to STDOUT. The result is in tabulate format.'
