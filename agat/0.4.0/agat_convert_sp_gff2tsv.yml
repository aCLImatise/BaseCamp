  description: When the features doesn't have Parent/ID relationships, the parser
    will try to group features using a common/shared attribute (i.e. a locus tag.).
    By default locus_tag and gene_id. You can provide another specific common/shared
    attribute using this option.

  description: Merge loci parameter, default deactivated. You turn on the parameter
    if you want to merge loci into one locus when they overlap. (at CDS level for
    mRNA, at exon level for other level2 features. Strand has to be the same). Prokaryote
    can have overlaping loci so it should not use it for prokaryote annotation. In
    eukaryote, loci rarely overlap. Overlaps could be due to error in the file, mRNA
    can be merged under the same parent gene if you acticate the option.
