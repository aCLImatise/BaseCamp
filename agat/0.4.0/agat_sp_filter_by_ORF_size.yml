  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_filter_by_ORF_size.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script reads\
  \ a gff annotation file, and create two output files, one\n    contains the gene\
  \ models with ORF passing the test, the other contains\n    the rest. By default\
  \ the test is \"> 100\" that means all gene models that\n    have ORF longer than\
  \ 100 Amino acids, will pass the test.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_filter_by_ORF_size.pl\
  \ --gff infile.gff [ -o outfile ]\n        agat_sp_filter_by_ORF_size.pl -h\n\n\
  Options:\n    -g or --gff\n            Input GTF/GFF file.\n\n    -s or --size\n\
  \            ORF size to apply the test. Default 100.\n\n    -t or --test Test to\
  \ apply (> < = >= <=). If you us one of these two\n    character >, <, please don't\
  \ forget to quote you parameter liket that\n    \"<=\". Else your terminal will\
  \ complain. By default it will be \">\"\n    -v      Verbose. Useful for debugging\
  \ purpose. Bolean\n\n    -o or --out or --output or --outfile\n            Output\
  \ GFF file. If no output file is specified, the output will\n            be written\
