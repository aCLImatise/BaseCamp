  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_value.pl\n\nDescription:\n  \
  \  The script aims to filter features according to attribute value (9th\n    column).\
  \ If the attribute tag is missing the feature will not be\n    discarded. If the\
  \ attribute exists and the value pass the test, the\n    feature is discarded. Attribute\
  \ are stored in the 9th column and have\n    this shape: tag=value /!\\ Removing\
  \ a level1 or level2 feature will\n    automatically remove all linked subfeatures,\
  \ and removing all children\n    of a feature will automatically remove this feature\
  \ too.\n\nUsage:\n        ./agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_value.pl -f infile.gff\
  \ --value 1 -t \"=\" [ --output outfile ]\n        ./agat_sp_select_feature_by_attribute_value.pl\
  \ --help\n\nOptions:\n    -f, --reffile, --gff or -ref\n            Input GFF3 file\
  \ that will be read\n\n    -a or --attribute\n            Attribute tag to specify\
  \ the attribute to analyse (attribute\n            example: tag=value).\n\n    -p,\
  \ --type or -l\n            primary tag option, case insensitive, list. Allow to\
  \ specied the\n            feature types that will be handled. You can specified\
  \ a specific\n            feature by given its primary tag name (column 3) as: cds,\
  \ Gene,\n            MrNa You can specify directly all the feature of a particular\n\
  \            level: level2=mRNA,ncRNA,tRNA,etc level3=CDS,exon,UTR,etc By\n    \
  \        default all feature are taking into account. fill the option by\n     \
  \       the value \"all\" will have the same behaviour.\n\n    --value Value to\
  \ check in the attribute\n\n    -t or --test Test to apply (> < = >= <=). default\
  \ value \"=\". If you us\n    one of these two character >, <, please don't forget\
  \ to quote you\n    parameter liket that \"<=\". Else your terminal will complain.\n\
  \    -o or --output\n            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified,\
  \ the output will\n            be written to STDOUT.\n\n    -v      Verbose option\
