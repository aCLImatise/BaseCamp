  Write allele frequencies ('T' or 'F')\nMinimal genotyping quality (GATK)\nMinimal\
  \ coverage for base call\nMinimal allele frequency for homozygous call\nMinimal\
  \ allele frequency for heterozygous call\nList of positions to exclude (gff)\n[vcf_files\
  \ ...] input vcf files as generated by the GATK UnifiedGenotyper\n\nTo omit an optional\
