  \ the grid and the configurations,\nand it can also compute posteriors.\n\nUsage:\

  \ not provided, BFs will be saved instead of posterior probability\n      --post\t\
  save various kinds of posterior probabilities (e.g. 'a+b')\n\t\ta: the gene has\
  \ at least one eQTL\n\t\tb: the SNP is 'the' eQTL for the gene, in at least one\
  \ subgroup, given that the gene has exactly one eQTL,\n\t\tassuming all cis SNPs\
  \ are equally likely and a single eQTL per gene\n\t\tc: the SNP is 'an' eQTL for\
  \ the gene, in at least one subgroup, given that the gene contains at least one\
  \ eQTL\n\t\tand that SNPs are independent\n\t\td: the SNP is an eQTL in subgroup\
