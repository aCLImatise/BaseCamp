help_text: "USAGE: IndexedExtractFullReads [options]\n\nExtracts reads and read pairs\
  \ with a mapping to a region to extract from an indexed bam file.  Uses the bam\
  \ file index.\nNote that since the read mate and split reads are also extracted,\
  \  many more locations that just those supplied in the\nbed file will be queried.\
  \  When querying small regions, an indexed scan may be faster. For extracting large\
  \  regions of\nthe genome, the linear scanning of ExtractFullReads will likely be\
  \ faster.\nVersion: 2.9.3-gridss\n\n\nOptions:\n\n--help\n-h                   \

  \       Index bam file.  Required. \n\nOUTPUT=File\nO=File                     \
  \   Output file location.  Required. \n\nREGION_BED=File\nB=File               \
  \         BED file containing regions to export  Required. \n\nEXTRACT_MATES=Boolean\
  \         Extract reads whose mate maps to an export region. If the MC tag is not\
  \ present, only the\n                              starting alignment position of\
  \ the mate is considered. When determining whether the mate\n                  \
  \            maps to an export region only the primary alignment of that mate is\
  \ considered. Secondary\n                              and supplementary alignments\
  \ are ignored.  Default value: true. This option can be set to\n               \
  \               'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}\
  \ \n\nEXTRACT_SPLITS=Boolean        Extract all records for reads that have a chimeric\
  \ alignment mapping to an export region \n                              Default\
  \ value: true. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. Possible\n\
  \                              values: {true, false} \n\nREGION_PADDING_SIZE=Integer\
  \   Number of additional bases surrounding each export region to include in the\
  \ index query.  \n                              Default value: 0. This option can\
  \ be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nWORKER_THREADS=Integer\nTHREADS=Integer\
  \               Number of worker threads to spawn. Defaults to number of cores available.\
  \ Note that I/O\n                              threads are not included in this\
  \ worker thread count so CPU usage can be higher than the\n                    \
  \          number of worker thread.  Default value: 8. This option can be set to\
  \ 'null' to clear the\n                              default value. \n\n"
