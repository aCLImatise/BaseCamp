help_text: "\t\t====== CD-HIT version 4.8.1 (built on Oct 26 2019) ======\n\nUsage:\
  \ cd-hit-2d [Options] \n\nOptions\n\n   -i\tinput filename for db1 in fasta format,\
  \ required, can be in .gz format\n   -i2\tinput filename for db2 in fasta format,\
  \ required, can be in .gz format\n   -o\toutput filename, required\n   -c\tsequence\
  \ identity threshold, default 0.9\n \tthis is the default cd-hit's \"global sequence\
  \ identity\" calculated as:\n \tnumber of identical amino acids or bases in alignment\n\
  \ \tdivided by the full length of the shorter sequence\n   -G\tuse global sequence\
  \ identity, default 1\n \tif set to 0, then use local sequence identity, calculated\
  \ as :\n \tnumber of identical amino acids or bases in alignment\n \tdivided by\
  \ the length of the alignment\n \tNOTE!!! don't use -G 0 unless you use alignment\
  \ coverage controls\n \tsee options -aL, -AL, -aS, -AS\n   -b\tband_width of alignment,\
  \ default 20\n   -M\tmemory limit (in MB) for the program, default 800; 0 for unlimitted;\n\
  \   -T\tnumber of threads, default 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used\n   -n\tword_length,\
  \ default 5, see user's guide for choosing it\n   -l\tlength of throw_away_sequences,\
  \ default 10\n   -t\ttolerance for redundance, default 2\n   -d\tlength of description\
  \ in .clstr file, default 20\n \tif set to 0, it takes the fasta defline and stops\
  \ at first space\n   -s\tlength difference cutoff, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9,\
  \ the shorter sequences need to be\n \tat least 90% length of the representative\
  \ of the cluster\n   -S\tlength difference cutoff in amino acid, default 999999\n\
  \ \tif set to 60, the length difference between the shorter sequences\n \tand the\
  \ representative of the cluster can not be bigger than 60\n   -s2\tlength difference\
  \ cutoff for db1, default 1.0\n \tby default, seqs in db1 >= seqs in db2 in a same\
  \ cluster\n \tif set to 0.9, seqs in db1 may just >= 90% seqs in db2\n   -S2\tlength\
  \ difference cutoff, default 0\n \tby default, seqs in db1 >= seqs in db2 in a same\
  \ cluster\n \tif set to 60, seqs in db2 may 60aa longer than seqs in db1\n   -aL\t\
  alignment coverage for the longer sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment\
  \ must covers 90% of the sequence\n   -AL\talignment coverage control for the longer\
  \ sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is\
  \ 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -aS\talignment\
  \ coverage for the shorter sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment\
  \ must covers 90% of the sequence\n   -AS\talignment coverage control for the shorter\
  \ sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is\
  \ 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -A\tminimal alignment\
  \ coverage control for the both sequences, default 0\n \talignment must cover >=\
  \ this value for both sequences \n   -uL\tmaximum unmatched percentage for the longer\
  \ sequence, default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1, the unmatched region (excluding leading\
  \ and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more than 10% of the sequence\n   -uS\tmaximum\
  \ unmatched percentage for the shorter sequence, default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1,\
  \ the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more\
  \ than 10% of the sequence\n   -U\tmaximum unmatched length, default 99999999\n\
  \ \tif set to 10, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)\n \t\
  must not be more than 10 bases\n   -B\t1 or 0, default 0, by default, sequences\
  \ are stored in RAM\n \tif set to 1, sequence are stored on hard drive\n \t!! No\
  \ longer supported !!\n   -p\t1 or 0, default 0\n \tif set to 1, print alignment\
  \ overlap in .clstr file\n   -g\t1 or 0, default 0\n \tby cd-hit's default algorithm,\
  \ a sequence is clustered to the first \n \tcluster that meet the threshold (fast\
  \ cluster). If set to 1, the program\n \twill cluster it into the most similar cluster\
  \ that meet the threshold\n \t(accurate but slow mode)\n \tbut either 1 or 0 won't\
  \ change the representatives of final clusters\n   -bak\twrite backup cluster file\
  \ (1 or 0, default 0)\n   -h\tprint this help\n\n   Questions, bugs, contact Weizhong\
