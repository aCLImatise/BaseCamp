help_text: "Usage: /tmp/tmpzi8kxamq/bin/cd-hit-para.pl options\n        This script\
  \ divide a big clustering job into pieces and submit\n        jobs to remote computers\
  \ over a network to make it parallel. \n        After all the jobs finished, the\
  \ script merge the clustering\n        results as if you just run a single cd-hit\
  \ or cd-hit-est.\n\n        You can also use it to divide big jobs on a single computer\
  \ if\n        your computer does not have enough RAM (with -L option).\n\nRequirements:\n\
  \      1 When run this script over a network, the directory where you \n       \
  \ run the scripts and the input files must be available on \n        all the remote\
  \ hosts with identical path.\n      2 If you choose \"ssh\" to submit jobs, you\
  \ have to have \n        passwordless ssh to any remote host, see ssh manual to\n\
  \        know how to set up passwordless ssh.\n      3 I suggest to use queuing\
  \ system instead of ssh, \n        I currently support PBS and SGE\n      4 cd-hit\
  \ cd-hit-2d cd-hit-est cd-hit-est-2d\n        cd-hit-div cd-hit-div.pl must be in\
  \ same directory where\n        this script is in.\nOptions \n\n     -i input filename\
  \ in fasta format, required\n     -o output filename, required\n    --P program,\
  \ \"cd-hit\" or \"cd-hit-est\", default \"cd-hit\"\n    --B filename of list of\
  \ hosts, \n        requred unless -Q or -L option is supplied\n    --L number of\
  \ cpus on local computer, default 0\n        when you are not running it over a\
  \ cluster, you can use \n        this option to divide a big clustering jobs into\
  \ small\n        pieces, I suggest you just use \"--L 1\" unless you have\n    \
  \    enough RAM for each cpu\n    --S Number of segments to split input DB into,\
  \ default 64\n    --Q number of jobs to submit to queue queuing system, default\
  \ 0\n        by default, the program use ssh mode to submit remote jobs\n    --T\
  \ type of queuing system, \"PBS\", \"SGE\" are supported, default PBS\n    --R restart\
  \ file, used after a crash of run\n     -h print this help\n\nMore cd-hit/cd-hit-est\
  \ options can be speicified in command line\n\n    Questions, bugs, contact Weizhong\
