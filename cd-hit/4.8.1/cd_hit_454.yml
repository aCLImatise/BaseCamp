  \ cd-hit-454 [Options] \n\nOptions\n\n   -i\tinput filename in fasta format, required,\
  \ can be in .gz format\n   -o\toutput filename, required\n   -c\tsequence identity\
  \ threshold, default 0.98\n \tthis is a \"global sequence identity\" calculated\
  \ as :\n \tnumber of identical amino acids or bases in alignment\n \tdivided by\
  \ the full length of the shorter sequence + gaps\n   -b\tband_width of alignment,\
  \ default 10\n   -M\tmemory limit (in MB) for the program, default 800; 0 for unlimitted;\n\
  \   -T\tnumber of threads, default 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used\n   -n\tword_length,\
  \ default 10, see user's guide for choosing it\n   -aL\talignment coverage for the\
  \ longer sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90%\
  \ of the sequence\n   -AL\talignment coverage control for the longer sequence, default\
  \ 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is 400,\n \tthen the\
  \ alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -aS\talignment coverage for the\
  \ shorter sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90%\
  \ of the sequence\n   -AS\talignment coverage control for the shorter sequence,\
  \ default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is 400,\n \t\
  then the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -B\t1 or 0, default 0, by\
  \ default, sequences are stored in RAM\n \tif set to 1, sequence are stored on hard\
  \ drive\n \t!! No longer supported !!\n   -g\t1 or 0, default 0\n \tby cd-hit's\
  \ default algorithm, a sequence is clustered to the first \n \tcluster that meet\
  \ the threshold (fast cluster). If set to 1, the program\n \twill cluster it into\
  \ the most similar cluster that meet the threshold\n \t(accurate but slow mode)\n\
  \ \tbut either 1 or 0 won't change the representatives of final clusters\n   -D\t\
  max size per indel, default 1\n   -match\tmatching score, default 2\n   -mismatch\t\
  mismatching score, default -1\n   -gap\tgap opening score, default -3\n   -gap-ext\t\
  gap extension score, default -1\n   -bak\twrite backup cluster file (1 or 0, default\
  \ 0)\n   -h\tprint this help\n\n   Questions, bugs, contact Weizhong Li at liwz@sdsc.edu\n\
