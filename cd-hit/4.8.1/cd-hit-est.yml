help_text: "\t\t====== CD-HIT version 4.8.1 (built on Oct 26 2019) ======\n\nUsage:\
  \ cd-hit-est [Options] \n\nOptions\n\n   -i\tinput filename in fasta format, required,\
  \ can be in .gz format\n   -j\tinput filename in fasta/fastq format for R2 reads\
  \ if input are paired end (PE) files\n \t -i R1.fq -j R2.fq -o output_R1 -op output_R2\
  \ or\n \t -i R1.fa -j R2.fa -o output_R1 -op output_R2 \n   -o\toutput filename,\
  \ required\n   -op\toutput filename for R2 reads if input are paired end (PE) files\n\
  \   -c\tsequence identity threshold, default 0.9\n \tthis is the default cd-hit's\
  \ \"global sequence identity\" calculated as:\n \tnumber of identical amino acids\
  \ or bases in alignment\n \tdivided by the full length of the shorter sequence\n\
  \   -G\tuse global sequence identity, default 1\n \tif set to 0, then use local\
  \ sequence identity, calculated as :\n \tnumber of identical amino acids or bases\
  \ in alignment\n \tdivided by the length of the alignment\n \tNOTE!!! don't use\
  \ -G 0 unless you use alignment coverage controls\n \tsee options -aL, -AL, -aS,\
  \ -AS\n   -b\tband_width of alignment, default 20\n   -M\tmemory limit (in MB) for\
  \ the program, default 800; 0 for unlimitted;\n   -T\tnumber of threads, default\
  \ 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used\n   -n\tword_length, default 10, see user's guide\
  \ for choosing it\n   -l\tlength of throw_away_sequences, default 10\n   -d\tlength\
  \ of description in .clstr file, default 20\n \tif set to 0, it takes the fasta\
  \ defline and stops at first space\n   -s\tlength difference cutoff, default 0.0\n\
  \ \tif set to 0.9, the shorter sequences need to be\n \tat least 90% length of the\
  \ representative of the cluster\n   -S\tlength difference cutoff in amino acid,\
  \ default 999999\n \tif set to 60, the length difference between the shorter sequences\n\
  \ \tand the representative of the cluster can not be bigger than 60\n   -aL\talignment\
  \ coverage for the longer sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment\
  \ must covers 90% of the sequence\n   -AL\talignment coverage control for the longer\
  \ sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is\
  \ 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -aS\talignment\
  \ coverage for the shorter sequence, default 0.0\n \tif set to 0.9, the alignment\
  \ must covers 90% of the sequence\n   -AS\talignment coverage control for the shorter\
  \ sequence, default 99999999\n \tif set to 60, and the length of the sequence is\
  \ 400,\n \tthen the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues\n   -A\tminimal alignment\
  \ coverage control for the both sequences, default 0\n \talignment must cover >=\
  \ this value for both sequences \n   -uL\tmaximum unmatched percentage for the longer\
  \ sequence, default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1, the unmatched region (excluding leading\
  \ and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more than 10% of the sequence\n   -uS\tmaximum\
  \ unmatched percentage for the shorter sequence, default 1.0\n \tif set to 0.1,\
  \ the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)\n \tmust not be more\
  \ than 10% of the sequence\n   -U\tmaximum unmatched length, default 99999999\n\
  \ \tif set to 10, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)\n \t\
  must not be more than 10 bases\n   -B\t1 or 0, default 0, by default, sequences\
  \ are stored in RAM\n \tif set to 1, sequence are stored on hard drive\n \t!! No\
  \ longer supported !!\n   -P\tinput paired end (PE) reads, default 0, single file\n\
  \ \tif set to 1, please use -i R1 -j R2 to input both PE files\n   -cx\tlength to\
  \ keep after trimming the tail of sequence, default 0, not trimming\n \tif set to\
  \ 50, the program only uses the first 50 letters of input sequence\n   -cy\tlength\
  \ to keep after trimming the tail of R2 sequence, default 0, not trimming\n \tif\
  \ set to 50, the program only uses the first 50 letters of input R2 sequence\n \t\
  e.g. -cx 100 -cy 80 for paired end reads\n   -ap\talignment position constrains,\
  \  default 0, no constrain\n \tif set to 1, the program will force sequences to\
  \ align at beginings\n \twhen set to 1, the program only does +/+ alignment\n  \
  \ -p\t1 or 0, default 0\n \tif set to 1, print alignment overlap in .clstr file\n\
  \   -g\t1 or 0, default 0\n \tby cd-hit's default algorithm, a sequence is clustered\
  \ to the first \n \tcluster that meet the threshold (fast cluster). If set to 1,\
  \ the program\n \twill cluster it into the most similar cluster that meet the threshold\n\
  \ \t(accurate but slow mode)\n \tbut either 1 or 0 won't change the representatives\
  \ of final clusters\n   -r\t1 or 0, default 1, by default do both +/+ & +/- alignments\n\
  \ \tif set to 0, only +/+ strand alignment\n   -mask\tmasking letters (e.g. -mask\
  \ NX, to mask out both 'N' and 'X')\n   -match\tmatching score, default 2 (1 for\
  \ T-U and N-N)\n   -mismatch\tmismatching score, default -2\n   -gap\tgap opening\
  \ score, default -6\n   -gap-ext\tgap extension score, default -1\n   -bak\twrite\
  \ backup cluster file (1 or 0, default 0)\n   -sc\tsort clusters by size (number\
  \ of sequences), default 0, output clusters by decreasing length\n \tif set to 1,\
  \ output clusters by decreasing size\n   -sf\tsort fasta/fastq by cluster size (number\
  \ of sequences), default 0, no sorting\n \tif set to 1, output sequences by decreasing\
  \ cluster size\n \tthis can be very slow if the input is in .gz format\n   -h\t\
