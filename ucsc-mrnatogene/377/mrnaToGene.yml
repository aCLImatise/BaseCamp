help_text: "mrnaToGene - convert PSL alignments of mRNAs to gene annotations\nusage:\n\
  \   mrnaToGene [options] psl genePredFile\n\nConvert PSL alignments with CDS annotation\
  \ from genbank to  gene\nannotations in genePred format.  Accessions without valids\
  \ CDS are\noptionally dropped. A best attempt is made to convert incomplete CDS\n\
  annotations.\n\nThe psl argument may either be a PSL file or a table in a databases,\n\
  depending on options.  CDS maybe obtained from the database or file.\nAccession\
  \ in PSL files are tried with and with out genbank versions.\n\nOptions:\n  -db=db\
  \ - get PSLs and CDS from this database, psl specifies the table.\n  -cdsDb=db -\
  \ get CDS from this database, psl is a file.\n  -cdsFile=file - get CDS from this\
  \ file, psl is a file.\n   File is tab separate with name as the first column and\n\
  \   NCBI CDS the second\n  -insertMergeSize=8 - Merge inserts (gaps) no larger than\
  \ this many bases.\n   A negative size disables merging of blocks.  This differs\
  \ from specifying zero\n   in that adjacent blocks will not be merged, allowing\
  \ tracking of frame for\n   each block. Defaults to 8 unless -cdsMergeSize or -utrMergeSize\
  \ are specified,\n   if either of these are specified, this option is ignored.\n\
  \  -smallInsertSize=n - alias for -insertMergetSize\n  -cdsMergeSize=-1 - merge\
  \ gaps in CDS no larger than this size.\n   A negative values disables.\n  -cdsMergeMod3\
  \ - only merge CDS gaps if they mod 3\n  -utrMergeSize=-1  - merge gaps in UTR no\
  \ larger than this size.\n   A negative values disables.\n  -requireUtr - Drop sequences\
  \ that don't have both 5' and 3' UTR annotated.\n  -genePredExt - create a extended\
  \ genePred, including frame information.\n  -allCds - consider PSL to be all CDS.\n\
  \  -noCds - consider PSL to not contain any CDS.\n  -keepInvalid - Keep sequences\
  \ with invalid CDS.\n  -quiet - Don't print print info about dropped sequences.\n\
  \  -ignoreUniqSuffix - ignore all characters after last `-' in qName\n   when looking\
  \ up CDS. Used when a suffix has been added to make qName\n   unique.  It is not\
  \ removed from the name in the genePred.\n\n\n"
