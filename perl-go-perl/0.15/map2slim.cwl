    The GO ID column (5) will contain GO slim IDs. The mapping corresponds\nto the\
    \ 2nd column in the table above. Note that the output file may\ncontain more lines\
    \ that the input file. This is because some full GO IDs\nhave more than one pertinent\
    \ slim ID.\nCOUNT MODE\nmap2slim can be run with the -c option, which will gives\
    \ the counts of\ndistinct gene products mapped to each slim term. The columns\
    \ are as\nfollows\nGO Term\nThe first column is the GO ID followed by the term\
    \ name (the term\nname is provided as it is found in both the full GO and slim\n\
    ontologies - these will usually be the same but occasionally the\nslim file will\
    \ lage behind changes in the GO file)\nCount of gene products for which this is\
    \ the most relevant slim term\nthe number of distinct gene products for which\
    \ this is the most\npertinent/direct slim ID. By most direct we mean that either\
    \ the\nassociation is made directly to this term, OR the association is\nmade\
    \ to a child of this slim term AND there is no child slim term\nwhich the association\
    \ maps to.\nFor most slims, this count will be equivalent to the number of\nassociations\
    \ directly mapped to this slim term. However, some older\nslim files are \"spotty\"\
    \ in that they admit \"gaps\". For example, if\nthe slim has all children of \"\
    biological process\" with the exception\nof \"behavior\" then all annotations\
    \ to \"behavior\" or its children\nwill be counted here\nsee example below\nCount\
    \ of gene products inferred to be associated with slim term\nand the number of\
    \ distinct gene products which are annotated to any\ndescendant of this slim ID\
    \ (or annotated directly to the slim ID).\nobsoletion flag\nGO ontology\nTo take\
    \ an example; if we use -t and -c like this:\nmap2slim -t -c GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo\
    \ ontology/gene_ontology.obo gene-associations/gene_association.fb\nThen part\
    \ of the results may look like this:\nGO:0008150 biological_process (biological_process)\
    \     34      10025           biological_process\nGO:0007610 behavior (behavior)\
    \        632     632             biological_process\nGO:0000004 biological process\
    \ unknown (biological process unknown)    832     832             biological_process\n\
    GO:0007154 cell communication (cell communication)    333     1701           \
    \ biological_process\nGO:0008037 cell recognition (cell recognition)       19\
    \      19              biological_process\n19 products were mapped to GO:0008037\
    \ or one of its children. (GO:0008037 is a leaf node in the slim, so the two counts\
    \ are identical).\nOn the other hand, GO:0008150 only gets 34 products for which\
    \ this is\nthe most relevant term. This is because most annotations would map\
    \ to\nsome child of GO:0008150 in the slim, such as GO:0007610 (behavior).\nThese\
    \ 34 gene products are either annotated directly to GO:0008150, or\nto some child\
    \ of this term which is not in the slim. This can point to\n'gaps' in the slim.\
    \ Note that running map2slim with the -b option will\n'plug' these gaps with artificial\
    \ filler terms."
