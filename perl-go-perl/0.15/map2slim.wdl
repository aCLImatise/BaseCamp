    will_force_mapslim: "This will force map2slim to give counts of the assoc file, rather\\nthan map it"
    when_used_conjunction: "When used in conjunction with -c will tab the output so that the\\nindentation reflects the tree hierarchy in the slim file"

The mapping corresponds\\nto the 2nd column in the table above. Note that the output file may\\ncontain more lines that the input file. This is because some full GO IDs\\nhave more than one pertinent slim ID.\\nCOUNT MODE\\nmap2slim can be run with the -c option, which will gives the counts of\\ndistinct gene products mapped to each slim term. The columns are as\\nfollows\\nGO Term\\nThe first column is the GO ID followed by the term name (the term\\nname is provided as it is found in both the full GO and slim\\nontologies - these will usually be the same but occasionally the\\nslim file will lage behind changes in the GO file)\\nCount of gene products for which this is the most relevant slim term\\nthe number of distinct gene products for which this is the most\\npertinent/direct slim ID. By most direct we mean that either the\\nassociation is made directly to this term, OR the association is\\nmade to a child of this slim term AND there is no child slim term\\nwhich the association maps to.\\nFor most slims, this count will be equivalent to the number of\\nassociations directly mapped to this slim term. However, some older\\nslim files are \\\"spotty\\\" in that they admit \\\"gaps\\\". For example, if\\nthe slim has all children of \\\"biological process\\\" with the exception\\nof \\\"behavior\\\" then all annotations to \\\"behavior\\\" or its children\\nwill be counted here\\nsee example below\\nCount of gene products inferred to be associated with slim term\\nand the number of distinct gene products which are annotated to any\\ndescendant of this slim ID (or annotated directly to the slim ID).\\nobsoletion flag\\nGO ontology\\nTo take an example; if we use -t and -c like this:\\nmap2slim -t -c GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo ontology/gene_ontology.obo gene-associations/gene_association.fb\\nThen part of the results may look like this:\\nGO:0008150 biological_process (biological_process)     34      10025           biological_process\\nGO:0007610 behavior (behavior)        632     632             biological_process\\nGO:0000004 biological process unknown (biological process unknown)    832     832             biological_process\\nGO:0007154 cell communication (cell communication)    333     1701            biological_process\\nGO:0008037 cell recognition (cell recognition)       19      19              biological_process\\n19 products were mapped to GO:0008037 or one of its children. (GO:0008037 is a leaf node in the slim, so the two counts are identical).\\nOn the other hand, GO:0008150 only gets 34 products for which this is\\nthe most relevant term. This is because most annotations would map to\\nsome child of GO:0008150 in the slim, such as GO:0007610 (behavior).\\nThese 34 gene products are either annotated directly to GO:0008150, or\\nto some child of this term which is not in the slim. This can point to\\n'gaps' in the slim. Note that running map2slim with the -b option will\\n'plug' these gaps with artificial filler terms."
