  \        The primary statistical output.\n\nOverlap Selection:\n  -overlap 5   \
  \            5' overlaps only\n  -overlap 3               3' overlaps only\n  -overlap\

  \  An overlap is classified as exactly one of 5', 3', contained or container.\n\
  \  By default, all overlaps are selected.  Specifying any of these options will\n\
  \  restrict overlaps to just those classifications.  E.g., '-overlap 5 -overlap\
  \ 3'\n  will select dovetail overlaps off either end of the read.\n\n  -overlap\
  \ atmost x        at most fraction x error  (overlap-erate <= x)\n  -overlap atleast\
  \ x       at least fraction x error (x <= overlap-erate)\n\n  Overlaps can be further\
  \ filtered by fraction error.  Usually, this will be an\n  'atmost' filtering to\
  \ use only the higher qualtiy overlaps.\n\n  A contained read has at least one container\
