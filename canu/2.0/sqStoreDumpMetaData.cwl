  doc: "dump information about reads There are four pairs of flags, one for raw, raw-trimmed,\
    \ corrected and corrected-trimmed.  Each pair tells if the sequence is valid and\
    \ if it is ignored. 1st letter - valid (uppercase) or invalid (lowercase). 2nd\
    \ letter - used  (uppercase) or ignored (lowercase). 1st pair   - raw sequence.\
    \ 2nd pair   - raw sequence, trimmed. 3rd pair   - corrected sequence. 4th pair\
    \   - corrected sequence, trimmed. Example: RR--c--- - Raw version exists and\
    \ is used.  Corrected version doesn't exist. RR--CCTt - Both raw and corrected\
    \ versions exist and are used. Corrected trimmed version exists, but is ignored."
