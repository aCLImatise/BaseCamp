help_text: "This exec takes a (set of) input read files (in fasta format) and a\n\
  file of input k-unitigs (specified with the switch -kunitigsfile) and outputs\n\
  the set of super-reads for these reads (in fasta format).\n\nThe args are the input\
  \ fasta files as well as (optionally) the directory\nwhere you want the work to\
  \ occur. If the directory is not specified, the\nwork is done in the current directory.\n\
  If the work directory doesn't exist then it is created.\n\nThe flags are as follows:\n\
  -l merLen : the length of the k-mer to use for the calculations (31)\n-s tableSize\
  \ : the size of the table when running jellyfish (2,000,000,000)\n-t numProcessors\
  \ : the number of processors to run jellyfish and create_k_unitigs (16)\n-kunitigsfile\
  \ filename : a user-given k-unitigs file; otherwise we calculate\n-mean-and-stdev-by-prefix-file\
  \ filename : a file giving mate info about each\n                     library. Each\
  \ line is the 2-letter prefix for the reads\n                     in the library\
  \ followed by its mean and stdev. This\n                     file is mandatory unless\
  \ -jumplibraryreads is specified\n-num-stdevs-allowed maxStdevsAllowedForJoining\
  \ : max stdevs allowed for joinKUnitigs (5)\n-mkudisr numBaseDiffs : max base diffs\
  \ between overlapping k-unitigs in super-reads (0)\n-minreadsinsuperread minReads\
  \ : super-reads containing fewer than numReads\n                               reads\
  \ will be eliminated (2)\n-merged-unitig-data-prefix prefix : the prefix for the\
  \ filenames relating to\n                     merged unitig data. We assume that\
  \ the k-unitig sequence\n                     is in  'prefix'.fasta, and the map\
  \ file from orig to\n                     merged k-unitigs is in 'prefix'.map.\n\
  -output-join-result-for-each-join : Now does nothing; kept so other programs\n \
  \                    won't break\n--stopAfter target : Stop the run after one of\
  \ the following \"target\" names:\n              createLengthStatisticsFiles\n \
  \             createKUnitigHashTable\n              addMissingMates\n          \
  \    findReadKUnitigMatches\n              createLengthStatisticsForMergedKUnitigsFiles\n\
  \              createKUnitigMaxOverlaps\n              joinKUnitigs\n          \
  \    getSuperReadInsertCounts\n              createFastaSuperReadSequences\n   \
  \           reduceSuperReads\n              createFinalReadPlacementFile\n     \
  \         createFinalSuperReadFastaSequences\n-noclean : don't clean up the files\
  \ afterwards\n-mikedebug : don't kill off intermediate results\n-jumplibraryreads\
  \ : we are generating for jump-library reads; a k-unitigs\n                    \
  \            file must be specified\n-keep-kunitigs-in-superread-names : Use the\
  \ super-read names which have the\n                k-unitig numbers in them; otherwise\
  \ use numeric names\n                (lower numbers correspond to shorter super-reads)\n\
  -extend-super-reads : extend the super-reads if the ending unitigs have\n      \
  \          unique continuations\n-closegaps : this is from a closeGaps.perl run,\
  \ so some filesizes may be 0\n-time : time the commands\n-h : help \n"
