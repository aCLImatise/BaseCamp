  \ polymorphism discovery.\n\ncitation: Erik Garrison, Gabor Marth\n          \"\
  Haplotype-based variant detection from short-read sequencing\"\n          arXiv:1207.3907\
  \ (http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.3907)\n\noverview:\n\n    To call variants from aligned\
  \ short-read sequencing data, supply BAM files and\n    a reference.  FreeBayes\
  \ will provide VCF output on standard out describing SNPs,\n    indels, and complex\
  \ variants in samples in the input alignments.\n\n    By default, FreeBayes will\
  \ consider variants supported by at least 2\n    observations in a single sample\
  \ (-C) and also by at least 20% of the reads from\n    a single sample (-F).  These\
  \ settings are suitable to low to high depth\n    sequencing in haploid and diploid\
  \ samples, but users working with polyploid or\n    pooled samples may wish to adjust\
  \ them depending on the characteristics of\n    their sequencing data.\n\n    FreeBayes\
  \ is capable of calling variant haplotypes shorter than a read length\n    where\
  \ multiple polymorphisms segregate on the same read.  The maximum distance\n   \
  \ between polymorphisms phased in this way is determined by the\n    --max-complex-gap,\
  \ which defaults to 3bp.  In practice, this can comfortably be\n    set to half\
  \ the read length.\n\n    Ploidy may be set to any level (-p), but by default all\
  \ samples are assumed to\n    be diploid.  FreeBayes can model per-sample and per-region\
  \ variation in\n    copy-number (-A) using a copy-number variation map.\n\n    FreeBayes\
  \ can act as a frequency-based pooled caller and describe variants\n    and haplotypes\
  \ in terms of observation frequency rather than called genotypes.\n    To do so,\
  \ use --pooled-continuous and set input filters to a suitable level.\n    Allele\
  \ observation counts will be described by AO and RO fields in the VCF output.\n\n\
