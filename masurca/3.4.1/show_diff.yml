  \ of structural differences for each sequence in\nthe reference and query, sorted\
  \ by position. For a reference\nsequence R, and its matching query sequence Q, differences\
  \ are\ncategorized as GAP (gap between two mutually consistent alignments),\nDUP\
  \ (inserted duplication), BRK (other inserted sequence), JMP\n(rearrangement), INV\
  \ (rearrangement with inversion), SEQ\n(rearrangement with another sequence). The\
  \ first five columns of\nthe output are seq ID, feature type, feature start, feature\
  \ end,\nand feature length. Additional columns are added depending on the\nfeature\
  \ type. Negative feature lengths indicate overlapping adjacent\nalignment blocks.\n\

  \ sequence with the given ID. The\nsum of the fifth column (ignoring negative values)\
  \ is the total\namount of inserted sequence. Summing the fifth column after removing\n\
  DUP features is total unique inserted sequence. Note that unaligned\nsequence are\
  \ not counted, and could represent additional \"unique\"\nsequences. See documentation\
  \ for tips on how to interpret these\nalignment break features.\n\n"
