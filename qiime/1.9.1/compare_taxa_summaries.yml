    not need to have the same taxa in the same order, as the script will make them
    compatible before comparing them [REQUIRED]

  description: 'the type of comparison to perform. Valid choices: paired or expected.
    "paired" will compare each sample in the taxa summary files that match based on
    sample ID, or that match given a sample ID map (see the --sample_id_map_fp option
    for more information). "expected" will compare each sample in the first taxa summary
    file to an expected sample (contained in the second taxa summary file). If "expected",
    the second taxa summary file must contain only a single sample that all other
    samples will be compared to (unless the --expected_sample_id option is provided)
