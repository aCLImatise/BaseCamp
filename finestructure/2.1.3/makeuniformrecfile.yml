help_text: "Usage ./makeuniformrecfile.pl <phasefile> <outputfile>\n     <phasefile>\
  \ is a valid chromopainter inputfile ending in .phase (in ChromoPainter v1 or v2\
  \ format) \n     <outputfile> will be a recombination file usable with <phasefile>\
  \ in ChromoPainter, nominally in Morgans/base.\nThe recombination rate is scaled\
  \ to be approximately that in humans (0.1 Morgans/Mb). Because of this, it will\
  \ NOT be usable directly and should only ever be used in conjunction with EM parameter\
  \ estimation, which corrects for the global amount of recombination. If you are\
  \ working on non-humans or simulated data, you may experience problems with EM estimation.\
  \ The parameter may get stuck at a local mode where there is effectively infinite\
  \ (or no) recombination. In this case, you should specify the initial conditions\
  \ of ChromoPainter to have a much smaller or larger Ne (-n) value.\n"
