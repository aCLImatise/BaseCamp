  \ will be created if it doesn't already exist.\n  o The default tile index field\
  \ is 'location'.\n  o Raster filenames will be put in the file exactly as they are\
  \ specified\n    on the commandline unless the option -write_absolute_path is used.\n\
  \  o If -skip_different_projection is specified, only files with same projection\
  \ ref\n    as files already inserted in the tileindex will be inserted.\n  o Simple\
  \ rectangular polygons are generated in the same\n    coordinate system as the rasters.\n"
