  \ files goes into a separate band in the VRT band. Otherwise,\n    the files are\
  \ considered as tiles of a larger mosaic.\n  o The default tile index field is 'location'\
  \ unless otherwise specified by -tileindex.\n  o In case the resolution of all input\
  \ files is not the same, the -resolution flag.\n    enable the user to control the\
  \ way the output resolution is computed. average is the default.\n  o Input files\
  \ may be any valid GDAL dataset or a GDAL raster tile index.\n  o For a GDAL raster\
  \ tile index, all entries will be added to the VRT.\n  o If one GDAL dataset is\
  \ made of several subdatasets and has 0 raster bands, its\n    datasets will be\
  \ added to the VRT rather than the dataset itself.\n  o By default, only datasets\
  \ of same projection and band characteristics may be added to the VRT.\n"
