  description: (Optional) When determining whether a probe covers a sequence, require
    that there be an exact match (i.e., no mismatches) of length at least ISLAND_OF_EXACT_MATCH

  description: Extend the coverage of each side of a probe by this number of bp. That
    is, a probe covers a region that consists of the portion of a sequence it hybridizes
    to, as well as this number of bp on each side of that portion. This is useful
    in modeling hybrid selection, where a probe hybridizes toa fragment that includes
    the region targeted by the probe, along with surrounding portions of the sequence.
    Increasing its value should reduce the number of probes required to achieve the
    desired coverage.

  description: (Optional) Use this value (KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K) as the k-mer length
    when constructing a map of k-mers to the probes that contain these k-mers. This
    map is used when mapping the given probes to target sequences and the k-mers serve
    as seeds for calculating whether a probe 'covers' a subsequence. The value should
    be sufficiently less than the probe length (PROBE_LENGTH) so that it can find
    mappings even when the candidate probe and target sequence are divergent. In particular,
    CATCH will try to find a value k >= KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K (by default, >=10) such
    that k divides PROBE_LENGTH and k < PROBE_LENGTH / MISMATCHES (if MISMATCHES=0,
    then k=PROBE_LENGTH). It will then use this k as the k-mer length in mappings;
    if no such k exists, it will use a randomized approach with KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K
    as the k-mer length.
