  description: Labels for one or more target datasets (e.g., one label per species)
  synonyms:
  - -d
  - --dataset
  args: !RepeatFlagArg
    name: DATASET
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Path to a FASTA file that provides the probes (one per sequence) whose
    coverage should be analyzed against the genomes in the given datasets
  synonyms:
  - -f
  - --probes-fasta
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: PROBES_FASTA
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Allow for this number of mismatches when determining whether a probe
    covers a sequence
  synonyms:
  - -m
  - --mismatches
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: MISMATCHES
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Say that a portion of a probe covers a portion of a sequence if the
    two share a substring with at most MISMATCHES mismatches that has length >= LCF_THRES
    bp
  synonyms:
  - -l
  - --lcf-thres
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: LCF_THRES
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: (Optional) When determining whether a probe covers a sequence, require
    that there be an exact match (i.e., no mismatches) of length at least ISLAND_OF_EXACT_MATCH
    bp between a portion of the probe and a portion of the sequence
  synonyms:
  - --island-of-exact-match
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: ISLAND_OF_EXACT_MATCH
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Extend the coverage of each side of a probe by this number of bp. That
    is, a probe covers a region that consists of the portion of a sequence it hybridizes
    to, as well as this number of bp on each side of that portion. This is useful
    in modeling hybrid selection, where a probe hybridizes toa fragment that includes
    the region targeted by the probe, along with surrounding portions of the sequence.
    Increasing its value should reduce the number of probes required to achieve the
    desired coverage.

  description: (Optional) An int >= 1 that gives the maximum number of processes to
    use in multiprocessing pools; uses min(number of CPUs in the system, MAX_NUM_PROCESSES)
    processes
  synonyms:
  - --max-num-processes
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: MAX_NUM_PROCESSES
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: (Optional) Use this value (KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K) as the k-mer length
    when constructing a map of k-mers to the probes that contain these k-mers. This
    map is used when mapping the given probes to target sequences and the k-mers serve
    as seeds for calculating whether a probe 'covers' a subsequence. The value should
    be sufficiently less than the probe length (PROBE_LENGTH) so that it can find
    mappings even when the candidate probe and target sequence are divergent. In particular,
    CATCH will try to find a value k >= KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K (by default, >=10) such
    that k divides PROBE_LENGTH and k < PROBE_LENGTH / MISMATCHES (if MISMATCHES=0,
    then k=PROBE_LENGTH). It will then use this k as the k-mer length in mappings;
    if no such k exists, it will use a randomized approach with KMER_PROBE_LENGTH_K
    as the k-mer length.
