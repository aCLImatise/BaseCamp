help_text: "NAME\n    bp_genbank_ref_extractor - Retrieves all related sequences for\
  \ a list of\n    searches on Entrez gene\n\nVERSION\n    version 1.75\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\
  \    bp_genbank_ref_extractor [options] [Entrez Gene Queries]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n \
  \   This script searches on *Entrez Gene* database and retrieves not only\n    the\
  \ gene sequence but also the related transcript and protein sequences.\n\n    The\
  \ gene UIDs of multiple searches are collected before attempting to\n    retrieve\
  \ them so each gene will only be analyzed once even if appearing\n    as result\
  \ on more than one search.\n\n    Note that *by default no sequences are saved*\
  \ (see options and\n    examples).\n\nOPTIONS\n    Several options can be used to\
  \ fine tune the script behaviour. It is\n    possible to obtain extra base pairs\
  \ upstream and downstream of the gene,\n    control the naming of files and genome\
  \ assembly to use.\n\n    See the section bugs for problems when using default values\
  \ of options.\n\n    --assembly\n        When retrieving the sequence, a specific\
  \ assemly can be defined. The\n        value expected is a regex that will be case-insensitive.\
  \ If it\n        matches more than one assembly, it will use the first match. It\n\
  \        defauls to \"(primary|reference) assembly\".\n\n    --debug\n        If\
  \ set, even more output will be printed that may help on debugging.\n        Unlike\
  \ the messages from --verbose and --very-verbose, these will\n        not appear\
  \ on the log file unless this option is selected. This\n        option also sets\
  \ --very-verbose.\n\n    --downstream, --down\n        Specifies the number of extra\
  \ base pairs to be retrieved downstream\n        of the gene. This extra base pairs\
  \ will only affect the gene\n        sequence, not the transcript or proteins.\n\
  \n    --email\n        A valid email used to connect to the NCBI servers. This may\
  \ be used\n        by NCBI to contact users in case of problems and before blocking\n\
  \        access in case of heavy usage.\n\n    --format\n        Specifies the format\
  \ that the sequences will be saved. Defaults to\n        *genbank* format. Valid\
  \ formats are 'genbank' or 'fasta'.\n\n    --genes\n        Specifies the name for\
  \ gene file. By default, they are not saved. If\n        no value is given defaults\
  \ to its UID. Possible values are 'uid',\n        'name', 'symbol' (the official\
  \ symbol or nomenclature).\n\n    --help\n        Display the documentation (this\
  \ text).\n\n    --limit\n        When making a query, limit the result to these\
  \ first specific\n        results. This is to prevent the use of specially unspecific\
  \ queries\n        and a warning will be given if a query returns more results than\
  \ the\n        limit. The default value is 200. Note that this limit is for *each*\n\
  \        search.\n\n    --non-coding, --nonon-coding\n        Some protein coding\
  \ genes have transcripts that are non-coding. By\n        default, these sequences\
  \ are saved as well. --nonon-coding can be\n        used to ignore those transcripts.\n\
  \n    --proteins\n        Specifies the name for proteins file. By default, they\
  \ are not\n        saved. If no value is given defaults to its accession. Possible\n\
  \        values are 'accession', 'description', 'gene' (the corresponding\n    \
  \    gene ID) and 'transcript' (the corresponding transcript accesion).\n\n    \
  \    Note that if not using 'accession' is possible for files to be\n        overwritten.\
  \ It is possible for the same gene to encode more than\n        one protein or different\
  \ proteins to have the same description.\n\n    --pseudo, --nopseudo\n        By\
  \ default, sequences of pseudo genes will be saved. --nopseudo can\n        be used\
  \ to ignore those genes.\n\n    --save\n        Specifies the path for the directory\
  \ where the sequence and log\n        files will be saved. If the directory does\
  \ not exist it will be\n        created altough the path to it must exist. Files\
  \ on the directory\n        may be rewritten if necessary. If unspecified, a directory\
  \ named\n        extracted sequences on the current directory will be used.\n\n\
  \    --save-data\n        This options saves the data (gene UIDs, description, product\n\
  \        accessions, etc) to a file. As an optional value, the file format\n   \
  \     can be specified. Defaults to CSV.\n\n        Currently only CSV is supported.\n\
  \n        Saving the data structure as a CSV file, requires the installation\n \
  \       of the Text::CSV module.\n\n    --transcripts, --mrna\n        Specifies\
  \ the name for transcripts file. By default, they are not\n        saved. If no\
  \ value is given defaults to its accession. Possible\n        values are 'accession',\
  \ 'description', 'gene' (the corresponding\n        gene ID) and 'protein' (the\
  \ protein the transcript encodes).\n\n        Note that if not using 'accession'\
  \ is possible for files to be\n        overwritten. It is possible for the same\
  \ gene to have more than one\n        transcript or different transcripts to have\
  \ the same description.\n        Also, non-coding transcripts will create problems\
  \ if using\n        'protein'.\n\n    --upstream, --up\n        Specifies the number\
  \ of extra base pairs to be extracted upstream of\n        the gene. This extra\
  \ base pairs will only affect the gene sequence,\n        not the transcript or\
  \ proteins.\n\n    --verbose, --v\n        If set, program becomes verbose. For\
  \ an extremely verbose program,\n        use --very-verbose instead.\n\n    --very-verbose,\
  \ --vv\n        If set, program becomes extremely verbose. Setting this option,\n\
  \        automatically sets --verbose as well. For help in debugging,\n        consider\
  \ using --debug\n\nEXAMPLES\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts=accession\
  \ '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n        Search Entrez gene with the\
  \ query '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND\n        H2B', and save their transcripts\
  \ sequences. Note that default value\n        of --limit may only extract some of\
  \ the hits.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts=accession --proteins=accession\n\
  \    --format=fasta '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B' '\"homo\n    sapiens\"\
  [organism] AND MCPH1'\"\n        Same as first example but also searches for '\"\
  homo\n        sapiens\"[organism] AND MCPH1', proteins sequences, and saves them\
  \ in\n        the fasta format.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --genes --up=100\
  \ --down=500 '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n        Same search as\
  \ first example but saves the genomic sequences instead\n        including 100 and\
  \ 500 bp upstream and downstream.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --genes --asembly='Alternate\
  \ HuRef' '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n        Same search as first\
  \ example but saves genomic sequences and from\n        the Alternate HuRef genome\
  \ assembly instead.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --save-data=CSV '\"homo sapiens\"\
  [organism] AND\n    H2B'\"\n        Same search as first example but does not save\
  \ any sequence but\n        saves all the results in a CSV file.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --save='search results' --genes=name\n    --upstream=200 downstream=500 --nopseudo\
  \ --nonnon-coding --transcripts\n    --proteins --format=fasta --save-data=CSV '\"\
  homo sapiens\"[organism] AND\n    H2B' '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND MCPH1'\"\n\
  \        Searches on Entrez gene for both '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\n\
  \        and '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND MCPH1' and saves the gene\n       \
  \ sequences of all hits (not passing the default limit and ignoring\n        pseudogenes)\
  \ plus 200 and 500bp upstream and downstream of them. It\n        will also save\
  \ the sequences of all transcripts and proteins of each\n        gene (but ignoring\
  \ non-coding transcripts). It will save the\n        sequences in the fasta format,\
  \ inside a directory \"search results\",\n        and save the results in a CSV\
  \ file\n\nKNOWN BUGS\n    *   When supplying options, it's possible to not supply\
  \ a value and use\n        their default. However, when the expected value is a\
  \ string, the\n        next argument may be confused as value for the option. For\
  \ example,\n        when using the following command:\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --transcripts 'H2A AND homo sapiens'\"\n\n        we mean to search for 'H2A AND\
  \ homo sapiens' saving only the\n        transcripts and using the default as base\
  \ for the filename. However,\n        the search terms will be interpreted as the\
  \ base for the filenames\n        (but since it's not a valid identifier, it will\
  \ return an error). To\n        prevent this, you can either specify the values:\n\
  \n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts 'accession' 'H2A AND homo\n \
  \       sapiens'\"\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts='accession'\
  \ 'H2A AND homo\n        sapiens'\"\n\n        or you can use the double hash to\
  \ stop processing options. Note that\n        this should only be used after the\
  \ last option. All arguments\n        supplied after the double dash will be interpreted\
  \ as search terms\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts -- 'H2A AND\
  \ homo sapiens'\"\n\nNOTES ON USAGE\n    *   Genes that are marked as 'live' and\
  \ 'protein-coding' should have at\n        least one transcript. However, This is\
  \ not always true due to\n        mistakes on annotation. Such cases will throw\
  \ a warning. When faced\n        with this, be nice and write to the entrez RefSeq\
  \ maintainers\n        <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/update.cgi>.\n\n    *\
  \   When creating the directories to save the files, if the directory\n        already\
  \ exists it will be used and no error or warning will be\n        issued unless\
  \ --debug as been set. If a non-directory file already\n        exists with that\
  \ name bp_genbank_ref_extractor exits with an error.\n\n    *   On the subject of\
  \ verbosity, all messages are saved on the log file.\n        The options --verbose\
  \ and --very-verbose only affect their printing\n        to standard output. Debug\
  \ messages are different as they will only\n        show up (and be logged) if requested\
  \ with --debug.\n\n    *   When saving a file, to avoid problems with limited filesystems\
  \ such\n        as NTFS or FAT, only some characters are allowed. All other\n  \
  \      characters will be replaced by an underscore. Allowed characters\n      \
  \  are:\n\n        a-z 0-9 - + . , () {} []'\n\n    *   bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ tries to use the same file extensions that\n        bioperl would expect when\
  \ saving the file. If unable it will use the\n        '.seq' extension.\n\nFEEDBACK\n\
