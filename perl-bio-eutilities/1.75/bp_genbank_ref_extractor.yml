  \ for a list of\n    searches on Entrez gene\n\n\e[1mVERSION\e[0m\n    version 1.75\n\
  \n\e[1mSYNOPSIS\e[0m\n    \e[1mbp_genbank_ref_extractor\e[0m [options] [Entrez Gene\
  \ Queries]\n\n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    This script searches on \e[4mEntrez Gene\e\
  [0m database and retrieves not only the\n    gene sequence but also the related\
  \ transcript and protein sequences.\n\n    The gene UIDs of multiple searches are\
  \ collected before attempting to\n    retrieve them so each gene will only be analyzed\
  \ once even if appearing as\n    result on more than one search.\n\n    Note that\
  \ \e[4mby default no sequences are saved\e[0m (see options and examples).\n\n\e\
  [1mOPTIONS\e[0m\n    Several options can be used to fine tune the script behaviour.\
  \ It is\n    possible to obtain extra base pairs upstream and downstream of the\
  \ gene,\n    control the naming of files and genome assembly to use.\n\n    See\
  \ the section bugs for problems when using default values of options.\n\n    \e\
  [1m--assembly\e[0m\n        When retrieving the sequence, a specific assemly can\
  \ be defined. The\n        value expected is a regex that will be case-insensitive.\
  \ If it matches\n        more than one assembly, it will use the first match. It\
  \ defauls to\n        \"(primary|reference) assembly\".\n\n    \e[1m--debug\e[0m\n\
  \        If set, even more output will be printed that may help on debugging.\n\
  \        Unlike the messages from \e[1m--verbose\e[0m and \e[1m--very-verbose\e\
  [0m, these will not\n        appear on the log file unless this option is selected.\
  \ This option\n        also sets \e[1m--very-verbose\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m--downstream\e\
  [0m, \e[1m--down\e[0m\n        Specifies the number of extra base pairs to be retrieved\
  \ downstream of\n        the gene. This extra base pairs will only affect the gene\
  \ sequence,\n        not the transcript or proteins.\n\n    \e[1m--email\e[0m\n\
  \        A valid email used to connect to the NCBI servers. This may be used by\n\
  \        NCBI to contact users in case of problems and before blocking access\n\
  \        in case of heavy usage.\n\n    \e[1m--format\e[0m\n        Specifies the\
  \ format that the sequences will be saved. Defaults to\n        \e[4mgenbank\e[0m\
  \ format. Valid formats are 'genbank' or 'fasta'.\n\n    \e[1m--genes\e[0m\n   \
  \     Specifies the name for gene file. By default, they are not saved. If\n   \
  \     no value is given defaults to its UID. Possible values are 'uid',\n      \
  \  'name', 'symbol' (the official symbol or nomenclature).\n\n    \e[1m--help\e\
  [0m\n        Display the documentation (this text).\n\n    \e[1m--limit\e[0m\n \
  \       When making a query, limit the result to these first specific results.\n\
  \        This is to prevent the use of specially unspecific queries and a\n    \
  \    warning will be given if a query returns more results than the limit.\n   \
  \     The default value is 200. Note that this limit is for \e[4meach\e[0m search.\n\
  \n    \e[1m--non-coding\e[0m, \e[1m--nonon-coding\e[0m\n        Some protein coding\
  \ genes have transcripts that are non-coding. By\n        default, these sequences\
  \ are saved as well. \e[1m--nonon-coding\e[0m can be used\n        to ignore those\
  \ transcripts.\n\n    \e[1m--proteins\e[0m\n        Specifies the name for proteins\
  \ file. By default, they are not saved.\n        If no value is given defaults to\
  \ its accession. Possible values are\n        'accession', 'description', 'gene'\
  \ (the corresponding gene ID) and\n        'transcript' (the corresponding transcript\
  \ accesion).\n\n        Note that if not using 'accession' is possible for files\
  \ to be\n        overwritten. It is possible for the same gene to encode more than\
  \ one\n        protein or different proteins to have the same description.\n\n \
  \   \e[1m--pseudo\e[0m, \e[1m--nopseudo\e[0m\n        By default, sequences of pseudo\
  \ genes will be saved. \e[1m--nopseudo\e[0m can be\n        used to ignore those\
  \ genes.\n\n    \e[1m--save\e[0m\n        Specifies the path for the directory where\
  \ the sequence and log files\n        will be saved. If the directory does not exist\
  \ it will be created\n        altough the path to it must exist. Files on the directory\
  \ may be\n        rewritten if necessary. If unspecified, a directory named extracted\n\
  \        sequences on the current directory will be used.\n\n    \e[1m--save-data\e\
  [0m\n        This options saves the data (gene UIDs, description, product\n    \
  \    accessions, etc) to a file. As an optional value, the file format can\n   \
  \     be specified. Defaults to CSV.\n\n        Currently only CSV is supported.\n\
  \n        Saving the data structure as a CSV file, requires the installation of\n\
  \        the Text::CSV module.\n\n    \e[1m--transcripts\e[0m, \e[1m--mrna\e[0m\n\
  \        Specifies the name for transcripts file. By default, they are not\n   \
  \     saved. If no value is given defaults to its accession. Possible values\n \
  \       are 'accession', 'description', 'gene' (the corresponding gene ID) and\n\
  \        'protein' (the protein the transcript encodes).\n\n        Note that if\
  \ not using 'accession' is possible for files to be\n        overwritten. It is\
  \ possible for the same gene to have more than one\n        transcript or different\
  \ transcripts to have the same description.\n        Also, non-coding transcripts\
  \ will create problems if using 'protein'.\n\n    \e[1m--upstream\e[0m, \e[1m--up\e\
  [0m\n        Specifies the number of extra base pairs to be extracted upstream of\n\
  \        the gene. This extra base pairs will only affect the gene sequence,\n \
  \       not the transcript or proteins.\n\n    \e[1m--verbose\e[0m, \e[1m--v\e[0m\n\
  \        If set, program becomes verbose. For an extremely verbose program, use\n\
  \        \e[1m--very-verbose\e[0m instead.\n\n    \e[1m--very-verbose\e[0m, \e[1m--vv\e\
  [0m\n        If set, program becomes extremely verbose. Setting this option,\n \
  \       automatically sets \e[1m--verbose\e[0m as well. For help in debugging, consider\n\
  \        using \e[1m--debug\e[0m\n\n\e[1mEXAMPLES\e[0m\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --transcripts=accession '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n        Search\
  \ Entrez gene with the query '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B',\n        and\
  \ save their transcripts sequences. Note that default value of\n        \e[1m--limit\e\
  [0m may only extract some of the hits.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts=accession\
  \ --proteins=accession\n    --format=fasta '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\
  \ '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND MCPH1'\"\n        Same as first example but\
  \ also searches for '\"homo sapiens\"[organism]\n        AND MCPH1', proteins sequences,\
  \ and saves them in the fasta format.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --genes\
  \ --up=100 --down=500 '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n        Same\
  \ search as first example but saves the genomic sequences instead\n        including\
  \ 100 and 500 bp upstream and downstream.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --genes\
  \ --asembly='Alternate HuRef' '\"homo\n    sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\"\n    \
  \    Same search as first example but saves genomic sequences and from the\n   \
  \     Alternate HuRef genome assembly instead.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --save-data=CSV '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND\n    H2B'\"\n        Same search\
  \ as first example but does not save any sequence but saves\n        all the results\
  \ in a CSV file.\n\n    \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --save='search results' --genes=name\n\
  \    --upstream=200 downstream=500 --nopseudo --nonnon-coding --transcripts\n  \
  \  --proteins --format=fasta --save-data=CSV '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND\n \
  \   H2B' '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND MCPH1'\"\n        Searches on Entrez gene\
  \ for both '\"homo sapiens\"[organism] AND H2B'\n        and '\"homo sapiens\"[organism]\
  \ AND MCPH1' and saves the gene sequences\n        of all hits (not passing the\
  \ default limit and ignoring pseudogenes)\n        plus 200 and 500bp upstream and\
  \ downstream of them. It will also save\n        the sequences of all transcripts\
  \ and proteins of each gene (but\n        ignoring non-coding transcripts). It will\
  \ save the sequences in the\n        fasta format, inside a directory \"search results\"\
  , and save the\n        results in a CSV file\n\n\e[1mKNOWN BUGS\e[0m\n    *   When\
  \ supplying options, it's possible to not supply a value and use\n        their\
  \ default. However, when the expected value is a string, the next\n        argument\
  \ may be confused as value for the option. For example, when\n        using the\
  \ following command:\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor --transcripts 'H2A AND\
  \ homo sapiens'\"\n\n        we mean to search for 'H2A AND homo sapiens' saving\
  \ only the\n        transcripts and using the default as base for the filename.\
  \ However,\n        the search terms will be interpreted as the base for the filenames\n\
  \        (but since it's not a valid identifier, it will return an error). To\n\
  \        prevent this, you can either specify the values:\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --transcripts 'accession' 'H2A AND homo\n        sapiens'\"\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --transcripts='accession' 'H2A AND homo\n        sapiens'\"\n\n        or you\
  \ can use the double hash to stop processing options. Note that\n        this should\
  \ only be used after the last option. All arguments supplied\n        after the\
  \ double dash will be interpreted as search terms\n\n        \"bp_genbank_ref_extractor\
  \ --transcripts -- 'H2A AND homo sapiens'\"\n\n\e[1mNOTES ON USAGE\e[0m\n    * \
  \  Genes that are marked as 'live' and 'protein-coding' should have at\n       \
  \ least one transcript. However, This is not always true due to mistakes\n     \
  \   on annotation. Such cases will throw a warning. When faced with this,\n    \
  \    be nice and write to the entrez RefSeq maintainers\n        <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/update.cgi>.\n\
  \n    *   When creating the directories to save the files, if the directory\n  \
  \      already exists it will be used and no error or warning will be issued\n \
  \       unless \e[1m--debug\e[0m as been set. If a non-directory file already exists\n\
  \        with that name bp_genbank_ref_extractor exits with an error.\n\n    * \
  \  On the subject of verbosity, all messages are saved on the log file.\n      \
  \  The options \e[1m--verbose\e[0m and \e[1m--very-verbose\e[0m only affect their\
  \ printing to\n        standard output. Debug messages are different as they will\
  \ only show\n        up (and be logged) if requested with \e[1m--debug\e[0m.\n\n\
  \    *   When saving a file, to avoid problems with limited filesystems such as\n\
  \        NTFS or FAT, only some characters are allowed. All other characters\n \
  \       will be replaced by an underscore. Allowed characters are:\n\n        \e\
  [1ma-z 0-9 - + . , () {} []'\e[0m\n\n    *   \e[1mbp_genbank_ref_extractor\e[0m\
  \ tries to use the same file extensions that\n        bioperl would expect when\
  \ saving the file. If unable it will use the\n        '.seq' extension.\n\n\e[1mFEEDBACK\e\
