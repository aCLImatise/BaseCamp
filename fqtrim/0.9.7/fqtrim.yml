  \n \n Trim low quality bases at the 3' end and can trim adapter sequence(s), filter\n\
  \ for low complexity and collapse duplicate reads.\n If read pairs should be trimmed\
  \ and kept together (i.e. never discarding\n only one read in a pair), the two file\
  \ names should be given delimited by a comma\n or a colon character.\n\nOptions:\n\
  -n  rename the reads using the <prefix> followed by a read counter;\n    if -C option\
  \ was also provided, the suffix \"_x<N>\" is appended\n    (where <N> is the read\
  \ duplication count)\n-o  write the trimmed/filtered reads to file(s) named <input>.<outsuffix>\n\
  \    which will be created in the current (working) directory (unless --outdir\n\
  \    is used); this suffix should include the file extension; if this extension\n\
  \    is .gz, .gzip or .bz2 then the output will be compressed accordingly.\n   \
  \ NOTE: if the input file is '-' (stdin) then this is the full name of the\n   \
  \ output file, not just the suffix.\n--outdir for -o option, write the output file(s)\
  \ to <outdir> directory instead\n-f  file with adapter sequences to trim, each line\
  \ having this format:\n    [<5_adapter_sequence>][ <3_adapter_sequence>]\n-5  trim\
  \ the given adapter or primer sequence at the 5' end of each read\n    (e.g. -5\
  \ CGACAGGTTCAGAGTTCTACAGTCCGACGATC)\n-3  trim the given adapter sequence at the\
  \ 3' end of each read\n    (e.g. -3 TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG)\n-A  disable polyA/T\
  \ trimming (enabled by default)\n-B  trim polyA/T at both ends (default: only poly-A\
  \ at 3' end, poly-T at 5')\n-O  output only reads affected by trimming (discard\
  \ clean reads!)\n-y  minimum length of poly-A/T run to remove (6)\n-q  trim read\
  \ ends where the quality value drops below <minq>\n-w  for -q, sliding window size\
  \ for calculating avg. quality (default 6)\n-t  for -q, limit maximum trimming at\

  \ trimming (default 5)\n-l  minimum read length after trimming (if the remaining\
  \ sequence is shorter\n    than this, the read will be discarded (trashed)(default:\
  \ 16)\n-r  write a \"trimming report\" file listing the affected reads with a list\n\
  \    of trimming operations\n-s1/-s2:  for paired reads, one of the reads (1 or\
  \ 2) is not being processed\n    (no attempt to trim it) but the pair is discarded\
  \ if the other read is\n    trashed by the trimming process\n--aidx option can only\
  \ be given with -r and -f options and it makes all the \n    vector/adapter trimming\
  \ operations encoded as a,b,c,.. instead of V,\n    corresponding to the order of\
  \ adapter sequences in the -f file\n-T  write the number of bases trimmed at 5'\
  \ and 3' ends after the read names\n    in the FASTA/FASTQ output file(s)\n-D  pass\
  \ reads through a low-complexity (dust) filter and discard any read\n    that has\
  \ over 50% of its length masked as low complexity\n--dmask option is the same with\
  \ -D but fqtrim will actually mask the low \n    complexity regions with Ns in the\
  \ output sequence\n-C  collapse duplicate reads and append a _x<N>count suffix to\
  \ the read\n    name (where <N> is the duplication count)\n-p  use <numcpus> CPUs\
  \ (threads) on the local machine\n-P  input is phred64/phred33 (use -P64 or -P33)\n\
  -Q  convert quality values to the other Phred qv type\n-M  disable read name consistency\
