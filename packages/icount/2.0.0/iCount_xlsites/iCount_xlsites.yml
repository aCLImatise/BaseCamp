  \ events and determine their positions.\n\nThe simplest version of this script would\
  \ oprate on such example::\n\n    |--a---b--- reference sequence, chr 14, positive\
  \ strand ------------\n        |rbc1---R1--------|\n        |rbc1---R2------|\n\
  \        |rbc2---R3------|\n            |rbc1--------R4-------------|\n        \
  \    |rbc3------R5-----|\n\nFive reads (R1-R5) are mapped to a reference sequence\
  \ (chromosome 14, positive\nstrand). Reads start on two distinct positons. On first\
  \ position, there is\nR1-R3. Cross-link site is located one nucleotide before start\
  \ of the read (on\nnegative strand, one nucleotide after end of read). However,\
  \ we wish to count\nnumber of cDNA molecules, not the number of reads. This can\
  \ be done by counting\nthe number of distinct random barcodes (sometimes also called\
  \ randomers). So in\nupper example, we have:\n\n    Postion a: 3 reads, 2 distinct\
  \ random barcodes = 2 cDNA's\n    Postion b: 2 reads, 2 distinct random barcodes\
  \ = 2 cDNA's\n\nHowever, things can get complicated when a single read is mapped\
  \ in multiple\nparts. This can happen for several reasons. One common example is\
  \ that introns\nare removed during transcription. This can be illustrated with the\
  \ following\nimage::\n\n    |---------------- reference -----------------------\n\
  \n    |--------------------------transcript--------------------------|\n    |---UTR5---||---intron---||---exon---||---intron---||---exon---|\n\
  \n                                |-------R1-------|\n                         \
  \       |--R2.1-->              <-R2.2-|\n                      |-R3.1->      <-R3.2->\
  \            <-R3.3-|\n                        |-R4.1->      <-R4.2-|\n\nRead R1\
  \ and R2 are starting on same position. For the sake of argument, let's\nalso pretend\
  \ they also have same random barcode. In so, we would count them as a\nsingle cDNA\
  \ molecule (= single cross-link event), even though it is obvious that\nthey represent\
  \ two separate cross-link events. In order to fix this, we count\nnot just the number\
  \ of different randomers on same position, but also number of\ndifferent \"second-start\"\
  \ coordinates. Second-start coordinate is just the\ncoordinate of the second part\
  \ of the read. This way, the actual number of\ncross-link events can be determined\
  \ more accurately. If read is not split, it's\nsecond-start coordinate is 0. If\
  \ read has multiple \"holes\" (as read R3) we\ndetermine second-start from the largest\
  \ hole.\n\nReads whose second-start do NOT fall on segmentation (like R4) are stored\
  \ in a\nseparate BAM file ``sites_strange``. They should be treated with special\
  \ care,\nsince they can indicate not-yet annotated features in genome. If segmentation\
  \ is\nnot given, all reads with holes, bigger than ``holesize_th`` are considered\n\
  strange.\n\nAnother parameter needs more explanation: ``group_by``. When algorithm\
  \ starts,\nreads from BAM file are grouped in hierarchical structure by::\n\n  \
  \  * chromosome and strand\n    * cross-link position\n    * random barcode\n  \
  \  * second-start\n\nEach second-start group receives 1 cDNA score. This score is\
  \ divided to each\nread in group (if there are 5 reads in group, each one gets 1/5\
  \ score). This\nenables that each read has it's cDNA score and of course, 1 \"read\
  \ score\". This\nscores can be assigned to start (actually, to cross-link position),\
  \ midlle or\nend position of read. By default, score is of course assigned to cross-link\n\
  location. But for diagnostic purpuses, scores can also be assigned to middle or\n\
  end coordinate of the read.\n\nTODO: check overlap between unique and multimap BED\
  \ files, should be small,\notherwise, we should think of a more approapriate quantification\
  \ of (division\nof randomers among) unique mapped sites that overlap with multimapped\
  \ reads\n\npositional arguments:\n  bam                   Input BAM file with mapped\
  \ reads\n  sites_unique          Output BED6 file to store data from uniquely mapped\
