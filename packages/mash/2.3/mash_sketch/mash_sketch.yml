  \ ...\n\nDescription:\n\n  Create a sketch file, which is a reduced representation\
  \ of a sequence or set of sequences (based on min-hashes) that can be used for fast\
  \ distance estimations. Inputs can be fasta or fastq files (gzipped or not), and\
  \ \"-\" can be given to read from standard input. Input files can also be files\
  \ of file names (see -l). For output, one sketch file will be generated, but it\
  \ can have multiple sketches within it, divided by sequences or files (see -i).\
  \ By default, the output file name will be the first input file with a '.msh' extension,\
  \ or 'stdin.msh' if standard input is used (see -o).\n\nOptions:\n\n  Option   \
