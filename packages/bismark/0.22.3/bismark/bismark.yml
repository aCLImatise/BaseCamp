    \ time). In addition, this option will\nautomatically use the option '--reorder',\

    greater than 1 (Bismark requires the Bowtie 2 output to be this way). Specifying\
    \ --reorder and\nsetting -p greater than 1 causes Bowtie 2 to run somewhat slower\
    \ and use somewhat more memory then\nif --reorder were not specified. Has no effect\
    \ if -p is set to 1, since output order will naturally\ncorrespond to input order\
    \ in that case."

help_text: "\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe following is a brief description of command line\
  \ options and arguments to control the Bismark\nbisulfite mapper and methylation\
  \ caller. Bismark takes in FastA or FastQ files and aligns the\nreads to a specified\
  \ bisulfite genome. Sequence reads are transformed into a bisulfite converted forward\
  \ strand\nversion (C->T conversion) or into a bisulfite treated reverse strand (G->A\
  \ conversion of the forward strand).\nEach of these reads are then aligned to bisulfite\
  \ treated forward strand index of a reference genome\n(C->T converted) and a bisulfite\
  \ treated reverse strand index of the genome (G->A conversion of the\nforward strand,\
  \ by doing this alignments will produce the same positions). These 4 instances of\
  \ Bowtie 2 or HISAT2\nare run in parallel. The sequence file(s) are then read in\
  \ again sequence by sequence to pull out the original\nsequence from the genome\
  \ and determine if there were any protected C's present or not.\n\nThe final output\
  \ of Bismark is in BAM/SAM format by default, described in more detail below.\n\n\
  \nUSAGE: bismark [options] <genome_folder> {-1 <mates1> -2 <mates2> | <singles>}\n\
  \n\nARGUMENTS:\n\n<genome_folder>          The path to the folder containing the\
  \ unmodified reference genome\n                         as well as the subfolders\
  \ created by the Bismark_Genome_Preparation\n                         script (/Bisulfite_Genome/CT_conversion/\
  \ and /Bisulfite_Genome/GA_conversion/).\n                         Bismark expects\
  \ one or more fastA files in this folder (file extension: .fa, .fa.gz\n        \
  \                 or .fasta or .fasta.gz). The path can be relative or absolute.\
  \ The path may also be set\n                         as '--genome_folder /path/to/genome/folder/'.\n\
  \n-1 <mates1>              Comma-separated list of files containing the #1 mates\
  \ (filename usually includes\n                         \"_1\"), e.g. flyA_1.fq,flyB_1.fq).\
  \ Sequences specified with this option must\n                         correspond\
  \ file-for-file and read-for-read with those specified in <mates2>.\n          \
  \               Reads may be a mix of different lengths. Bismark will produce one\
  \ mapping result\n                         and one report file per paired-end input\
  \ file pair.\n\n-2 <mates2>              Comma-separated list of files containing\
  \ the #2 mates (filename usually includes\n                         \"_2\"), e.g.\
  \ flyA_2.fq,flyB_2.fq). Sequences specified with this option must\n            \
  \             correspond file-for-file and read-for-read with those specified in\
  \ <mates1>.\n                         Reads may be a mix of different lengths.\n\
  \n<singles>                A comma- or space-separated list of files containing\
  \ the reads to be aligned (e.g.\n                         lane1.fq,lane2.fq lane3.fq).\
  \ Reads may be a mix of different lengths. Bismark will\n                      \
  \   produce one mapping result and one report file per input file. Please note that\n\
  \                         one should supply a list of files in conjunction with\
  \ --basename as the output files\n                         will constantly overwrite\
  \ each other...\n\n\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n\nInput:\n\n--se/--single_end <list> Sets single-end\
  \ mapping mode explicitly giving a list of file names as <list>.\n             \
  \            The filenames may be provided as a comma [,] or colon [:] separated\
  \ list.\n\n-q/--fastq               The query input files (specified as <mate1>,<mate2>\
  \ or <singles> are FASTQ\n                         files (usually having extension\
  \ .fg or .fastq). This is the default. See also\n                         --solexa-quals.\n\
  \n-f/--fasta               The query input files (specified as <mate1>,<mate2> or\
  \ <singles> are FASTA\n                         files (usually having extensions\
  \ .fa, .mfa, .fna or similar). All quality values\n                         are\
  \ assumed to be 40 on the Phred scale. FASTA files are expected to contain both\n\
  \                         the read name and the sequence on a single line (and not\
  \ spread over several lines).\n\n-s/--skip <int>          Skip (i.e. do not align)\
  \ the first <int> reads or read pairs from the input.\n\n-u/--upto <int>       \
  \   Only aligns the first <int> reads or read pairs from the input. Default: no\
  \ limit.\n\n--phred33-quals          FASTQ qualities are ASCII chars equal to the\
  \ Phred quality plus 33. Default: ON.\n\n--phred64-quals          FASTQ qualities\
  \ are ASCII chars equal to the Phred quality plus 64. Default: off.\n\n--path_to_bowtie2\
  \        The full path </../../> to the Bowtie 2 installation on your system. If\
  \ not\n                         specified it is assumed that Bowtie 2 is in the\
  \ PATH.\n\n--path_to_hisat2         The full path </../../> to the HISAT2 installation\
  \ on your system. If not\n                         specified it is assumed that\
  \ HISAT2 is in the PATH.\n\nAlignment:\n\n\n-N <int>                 Sets the number\
  \ of mismatches to allowed in a seed alignment during multiseed alignment.\n   \
  \                      Can be set to 0 or 1. Setting this higher makes alignment\
  \ slower (often much slower)\n                         but increases sensitivity.\
  \ Default: 0. This option is only available for Bowtie 2 (for\n                \
  \         Bowtie 1 see -n).\n\n-L <int>                 Sets the length of the seed\
  \ substrings to align during multiseed alignment. Smaller values\n             \
  \            make alignment slower but more senstive. Default: the --sensitive preset\
  \ of Bowtie 2 is\n                         used by default, which sets -L to 20.\
  \ maximum of L can be set to 32. The length of the seed\n                      \
  \   would effect the alignment speed dramatically while the larger L, the faster\
  \ the aligment.\n                         This option is only available for Bowtie\
  \ 2 (for Bowtie 1 see -l).\n\n--ignore-quals           When calculating a mismatch\
  \ penalty, always consider the quality value at the mismatched\n               \
  \          position to be the highest possible, regardless of the actual value.\
  \ I.e. input is treated\n                         as though all quality values are\
  \ high. This is also the default behavior when the input\n                     \
  \    doesn't specify quality values (e.g. in -f mode). This option is invariable\
  \ and on by default.\n\n-I/--minins <int>        The minimum insert size for valid\
  \ paired-end alignments. E.g. if -I 60 is specified and\n                      \
  \   a paired-end alignment consists of two 20-bp alignments in the appropriate orientation\n\
  \                         with a 20-bp gap between them, that alignment is considered\
  \ valid (as long as -X is also\n                         satisfied). A 19-bp gap\
  \ would not be valid in that case. Default: 0.\n\n-X/--maxins <int>        The maximum\
  \ insert size for valid paired-end alignments. E.g. if -X 100 is specified and\n\
  \                         a paired-end alignment consists of two 20-bp alignments\
  \ in the proper orientation with a\n                         60-bp gap between them,\
  \ that alignment is considered valid (as long as -I is also satisfied).\n      \
  \                   A 61-bp gap would not be valid in that case. Default: 500.\n\
  \n--parallel <int>         (May also be --multicore <int>) Sets the number of parallel\
  \ instances of Bismark to be run concurrently.\n                         This forks\
  \ the Bismark alignment step very early on so that each individual Spawn of Bismark\
  \ processes\n                         only every n-th sequence (n being set by --parallel).\
  \ Once all processes have completed,\n                         the individual BAM\
  \ files, mapping reports, unmapped or ambiguous FastQ files are merged\n       \
  \                  into single files in very much the same way as they would have\
  \ been generated running Bismark\n                         conventionally with only\
  \ a single instance.\n\n                         If system resources are plentiful\
  \ this is a viable option to speed up the alignment process\n                  \
  \       (we observed a near linear speed increase for up to --parallel 8 tested).\
  \ However, please note\n                         that a typical Bismark run will\
  \ use several cores already (Bismark itself, 2 or 4 threads of\n               \
  \          Bowtie2/HISAT2, Samtools, gzip etc...) and ~10-16GB of memory depending\
  \ on the choice of aligner\n                         and genome. WARNING: Bismark\
  \ Parallel (BP?) is resource hungry! Each value of --parallel specified\n      \
  \                   will effectively lead to a linear increase in compute and memory\
  \ requirements, so --parallel 4 for\n                         e.g. the GRCm38 mouse\
  \ genome will probably use ~20 cores and eat ~40GB or RAM, but at the same time\n\
  \                         reduce the alignment time to ~25-30%. You have been warned.\n\
  \n--local                  In this mode, it is not required that the entire read\
  \ aligns from one end to the other. Rather, some\n                         characters\
  \ may be omitted (“soft-clipped”) from the ends in order to achieve the greatest\
  \ possible\n                         alignment score. For Bowtie 2, the match bonus\
  \ --ma (default: 2) is used in this mode, and the best possible\n              \
  \           alignment score is equal to the match bonus (--ma) times the length\
  \ of the read. This is mutually exclusive with\n                         end-to-end\
  \ alignments. For HISAT2, it is currently not exactly known how the best alignment\
  \ is calculated.\n                         DEFAULT: OFF.\n\n\nOutput:\n\n--non_directional\
  \        The sequencing library was constructed in a non strand-specific manner,\
  \ alignments to all four\n                         bisulfite strands will be reported.\
  \ Default: OFF.\n\n                         (The current Illumina protocol for BS-Seq\
  \ is directional, in which case the strands complementary\n                    \
  \     to the original strands are merely theoretical and should not exist in reality.\
  \ Specifying directional\n                         alignments (which is the default)\
  \ will only run 2 alignment threads to the original top (OT)\n                 \
  \        or bottom (OB) strands in parallel and report these alignments. This is\
  \ the recommended option\n                         for sprand-specific libraries).\n\
  \n--pbat                   This options may be used for PBAT-Seq libraries (Post-Bisulfite\
  \ Adapter Tagging; Kobayashi et al.,\n                         PLoS Genetics, 2012).\
  \ This is essentially the exact opposite of alignments in 'directional' mode,\n\
  \                         as it will only launch two alignment threads to the CTOT\
  \ and CTOB strands instead of the normal OT\n                         and OB ones.\
  \ Use this option only if you are certain that your libraries were constructed following\n\
  \                         a PBAT protocol (if you don't know what PBAT-Seq is you\
  \ should not specify this option). The option\n                         --pbat works\
  \ only for FastQ files (in both Bowtie and Bowtie 2 mode) and using uncompressed\n\
  \                         temporary files only).\n\n--sam-no-hd              Suppress\
  \ SAM header lines (starting with @). This might be useful when very large input\
  \ files are\n                         split up into several smaller files to run\
  \ concurrently and the output files are to be merged.\n\n--rg_tag              \
  \   Write out a Read Group tag to the resulting SAM/BAM file. This will write the\
  \ following line to the\n                         SAM header: @RG PL: ILLUMINA ID:SAMPLE\
  \ SM:SAMPLE ; to set ID and SM see --rg_id and --rg_sample.\n                  \
  \       In addition each read receives an RG:Z:RG-ID tag. Default: OFF.\n\n--rg_id\
  \ <string>         Sets the ID field in the @RG header line. The default is 'SAMPLE'.\n\
  \n--rg_sample <string>     Sets the SM field in the @RG header line; can't be set\
  \ without setting --rg_id as well. The default is\n                         'SAMPLE'.\n\
  \n-un/--unmapped           Write all reads that could not be aligned to a file in\
  \ the output directory. Written reads will\n                         appear as they\
  \ did in the input, without any translation of quality values that may have\n  \
  \                       taken place within Bowtie or Bismark. Paired-end reads will\
  \ be written to two parallel files with _1\n                         and _2 inserted\
  \ in their filenames, i.e. _unmapped_reads_1.txt and unmapped_reads_2.txt. Reads\n\
  \                         with more than one valid alignment with the same number\
  \ of lowest mismatches (ambiguous mapping)\n                         are also written\
  \ to _unmapped_reads.txt unless the option --ambiguous is specified as well.\n\n\
  --ambiguous              Write all reads which produce more than one valid alignment\
  \ with the same number of lowest\n                         mismatches or other reads\
  \ that fail to align uniquely to a file in the output directory.\n             \
  \            Written reads will appear as. they did in the input, without any of\
  \ the translation of quality\n                         values that may have taken\
  \ place within Bowtie or Bismark. Paired-end reads will be written to two\n    \
  \                     parallel files with _1 and _2 inserted in their filenames,\
  \ i.e. _ambiguous_reads_1.txt and\n                         _ambiguous_reads_2.txt.\
  \ These reads are not written to the file specified with --un.\n\n-o/--output_dir\
  \ <dir>    Write all output files into this directory. By default the output files\
  \ will be written into\n                         the same folder as the input file(s).\
  \ If the specified folder does not exist, Bismark will attempt\n               \
  \          to create it first. The path to the output folder can be either relative\
  \ or absolute.\n\n--temp_dir <dir>         Write temporary files to this directory\
  \ instead of into the same directory as the input files. If\n                  \
  \       the specified folder does not exist, Bismark will attempt to create it first.\
  \ The path to the\n                         temporary folder can be either relative\
  \ or absolute.\n\n--non_bs_mm              Optionally, outputs an extra column specifying\
  \ the number of non-bisulfite mismatches a read has.\n                         This\
  \ option is only available in end-to-end mode. The value is just the number of actual\
  \ non-bisulfite\n                         mismatches and ignores potential insertions\
  \ or deletions.\n                         The format for single-end reads and read\
  \ 1 of paired-end reads is 'XA:Z:number of mismatches'\n                       \
  \  and 'XB:Z:number of mismatches' for read 2 of paired-end reads.\n\n--gzip   \
  \                Temporary bisulfite conversion files will be written out in a GZIP\
  \ compressed form to save disk\n                         space. This option is available\
  \ for most alignment modes but is not available for paired-end FastA\n         \
  \                files. This option might be somewhat slower than writing out uncompressed\
  \ files, but this awaits\n                         further testing.\n\n--sam   \
  \                 The output will be written out in SAM format instead of the default\
  \ BAM format. Be warned that this\n                         requires ~10 times more\
  \ disk space. --sam is not compatible with the option --parallel.\n\n--bam     \
  \               Bismark will attempt to use the path to Samtools that was specified\
  \ with '--samtools_path', or, if it hasn't\n                         been specified,\
  \ attempt to find Samtools in the PATH. If no installation of Samtools can be found,\n\
  \                         the SAM output will be compressed with GZIP instead (yielding\
  \ a .sam.gz output file). Default: ON.\n\n--cram                   Writes the output\
  \ to a CRAM file instead of BAM. This requires the use of Samtools 1.2 or higher.\n\
  \n--cram_ref <ref_file>    CRAM output requires you to specify a reference genome\
  \ as a single FastA file. If this single-FastA\n                         reference\

  \      explicitly if Samtools is in the PATH already.\n\n--prefix <prefix>     \
  \   Prefixes <prefix> to the output filenames. Trailing dots will be replaced by\
  \ a single one. For\n                         example, '--prefix test' with 'file.fq'\
  \ would result in the output file 'test.file.fq_bismark.sam' etc.\n\n-B/--basename\
  \ <basename> Write all output to files starting with this base file name. For example,\
  \ '--basename foo'\n                         would result in the files 'foo.bam'\
  \ and 'foo_SE_report.txt' (or its paired-end equivalent). Takes\n              \
  \           precedence over --prefix. Be advised that you should not use this option\
  \ in conjunction with supplying\n                         lists of files to be processed\
  \ consecutively, as all output files will constantly overwrite each other.\n\n--old_flag\
  \               Only in paired-end SAM mode, uses the FLAG values used by Bismark\
  \ v0.8.2 and before. In addition,\n                         this options appends\
  \ /1 and /2 to the read IDs for reads 1 and 2 relative to the input file. Since\n\
  \                         both the appended read IDs and custom FLAG values may\
  \ cause problems with some downstream tools\n                         such as Picard,\

  \n--ambig_bam              For reads that have multiple alignments a random alignment\
  \ is written out to a special file ending in\n                         '.ambiguous.bam'.\
  \ The alignments are in Bowtie2 format and do not any contain Bismark specific\n\
  \                         entries such as the methylation call etc. These ambiguous\
  \ BAM files are intended to be used as\n                         coverage estimators\
  \ for variant callers.\n\n--nucleotide_coverage    Calculates the mono- and di-nucleotide\
  \ sequence composition of covered positions in the analysed BAM\n              \
  \           file and compares it to the genomic average composition once alignments\
  \ are complete by calling 'bam2nuc'.\n                         Since this calculation\
  \ may take a while, bam2nuc attempts to write the genomic sequence composition\n\
  \                         into a file called 'genomic_nucleotide_frequencies.txt'\
  \ indside the reference genome folder so it can\n                         be re-used\
  \ the next time round instead of calculating it once again. If a file 'nucleotide_stats.txt'\
  \ is\n                         found with the Bismark reports it will be automatically\
  \ detected and used for the Bismark HTML report.\n                         This\
  \ option works only for BAM or CRAM files.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n--icpc              \
  \     This option will truncate read IDs at the first space or tab it encounters,\
  \ which are sometimes used to add\n                         comments to a FastQ\
  \ entry (instead of replacing them with underscores (_) as is the default behaviour).\
  \ The\n                         opion is deliberately somewhat cryptic (\"I couldn't\
  \ possibly comment\"), as it only becomes relevant when R1 and R2\n            \
  \             of read pairs are mapped separately in single-end mode, and then re-paired\
  \ afterwards (the SAM format dictates\n                         that R1 and R2 have\
  \ the same read ID). Paired-end mapping already creates BAM files with identical\
  \ read IDs.\n                         For more information please see here: https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/issues/236.\
  \ Default: OFF.\n\n\nOTHER:\n\n-h/--help                Displays this help file.\n\
  \n-v/--version             Displays version information.\n\n\n\n\nBOWTIE 2 SPECIFIC\
  \ OPTIONS:\n\n--bowtie2                Default: ON. Uses Bowtie 2 as default aligner.\
  \ Bismark limits Bowtie 2 to only perform end-to-end\n                         alignments,\
  \ i.e. searches for alignments involving all read characters (also called\n    \
  \                     untrimmed or unclipped alignments). Bismark assumes that raw\
  \ sequence data is adapter\n                         and/or quality trimmed where\
  \ appropriate. Both small (.bt2) and large (.bt2l) Bowtie 2\n                  \
  \       indexes are supported. To use HISAT2 instead of Bowtie 2 please see option\
  \ --hisat2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n--no_dovetail            It is possible,\
  \ though unusual, for the mates to \"dovetail\", with the mates seemingly extending\n\
  \                         \"past\" each other as in this example:\n\n          \
  \               Mate 1:                 GTCAGCTACGATATTGTTTGGGGTGACACATTACGC\n \
  \                        Mate 2:            TATGAGTCAGCTACGATATTGTTTGGGGTGACACAT\n\
  \                         Reference: GCAGATTATATGAGTCAGCTACGATATTGTTTGGGGTGACACATTACGCGTCTTTGAC\n\
  \n                         By default, dovetailing is considered inconsistent with\
  \ concordant alignment, but by default\n                         Bismark calls Bowtie\
  \ 2 with --dovetail, causing it to consider dovetailing alignments as\n        \
  \                 concordant. This becomes relevant whenever reads are clipped from\
  \ their 5' end prior to mapping,\n                         e.g. because of quality\
  \ or bias issues.\n\n                         Specify --no_dovetail to turn off\
  \ this behaviour for paired-end libraries. Default: OFF.\n\n\nHISAT2 SPECIFIC OPTIONS:\n\
  \n\n--hisat2                 Uses HISAT2 instead of Bowtie 2. Bismark uses HISAT2\
  \ in end-to-end mode by default,\n                         i.e. searches for alignments\
  \ involving all read characters (also called untrimmed or unclipped alignments)\n\
  \                         using the option '--no-softclipping'. Bismark assumes\
  \ that raw sequence data is adapter and/or quality\n                         trimmed\
  \ where appropriate. From v0.22.0 onwards, Bismark also supports the local alignment\
  \ mode of\n                         HISAT2 (please see --local). Both small (.ht2)\
  \ and large (.ht2l) HISAT2 indexes are supported. Default: OFF. \n\n--no-spliced-alignment\
  \   Disable spliced alignment. Default: spliced-alignments are performed.\n\n--known-splicesite-infile\
  \ <path>   Provide a list of known splice sites.\n\n\nPaired-end options:\n\n--no-mixed\
  \               This option disables the behavior to try to find alignments for\
  \ the individual mates if\n                         it cannot find a concordant\
  \ or discordant alignment for a pair. This option is invariably on by default.\n\
  \n--no-discordant          Normally, Bowtie 2 or HISAT2 look for discordant alignments\
  \ if it cannot find any concordant alignments.\n                         A discordant\
  \ alignment is an alignment where both mates align uniquely, but that does not\n\
  \                         satisfy the paired-end constraints (--fr/--rf/--ff, -I,\
  \ -X). This option disables that behavior\n                         and it is on\
  \ by default.\n\n\n\nBowtie 2 effort options:\n\n-D <int>                 Up to\
  \ <int> consecutive seed extension attempts can \"fail\" before Bowtie 2 moves on,\
  \ using\n                         the alignments found so far. A seed extension\
  \ \"fails\" if it does not yield a new best or a\n                         new second-best\
  \ alignment. Default: 15.\n\n-R <int>                 <int> is the maximum number\
  \ of times Bowtie 2 will \"re-seed\" reads with repetitive seeds.\n            \
  \             When \"re-seeding,\" Bowtie 2 simply chooses a new set of reads (same\
  \ length, same number of\n                         mismatches allowed) at different\
  \ offsets and searches for more alignments. A read is considered\n             \
  \            to have repetitive seeds if the total number of seed hits divided by\
  \ the number of seeds\n                         that aligned at least once is greater\
  \ than 300. Default: 2.\n\nBowtie 2/ HISAT2 parallelization options:\n\n\n-p NTHREADS\
  \              Launch NTHREADS parallel search threads (default: 1). Threads will\
  \ run on separate processors/cores\n                         and synchronize when\
  \ parsing reads and outputting alignments. Searching for alignments is highly\n\
  \                         parallel, and speedup is close to linear. Increasing -p\
  \ increases Bowtie 2's memory footprint.\n                         E.g. when aligning\
  \ to a human genome index, increasing -p from 1 to 8 increases the memory footprint\n\
  \                         by a few hundred megabytes. This option is only available\
  \ if bowtie is linked with the pthreads\n                         library (i.e.\
  \ if BOWTIE_PTHREADS=0 is not specified at build time). In addition, this option\
  \ will\n                         automatically use the option '--reorder', which\
  \ guarantees that output SAM records are printed in\n                         an\
  \ order corresponding to the order of the reads in the original input file, even\
  \ when -p is set\n                         greater than 1 (Bismark requires the\
  \ Bowtie 2 output to be this way). Specifying --reorder and\n                  \
  \       setting -p greater than 1 causes Bowtie 2 to run somewhat slower and use\
  \ somewhat more memory then\n                         if --reorder were not specified.\
  \ Has no effect if -p is set to 1, since output order will naturally\n         \
  \                correspond to input order in that case.\n\nScoring options:\n\n\
  --score_min <func>       Sets a function governing the minimum alignment score needed\
  \ for an alignment to be considered\n                         \"valid\" (i.e. good\
  \ enough to report). This is a function of read length. \n\n                   \
  \      In end-to-end mode (default), and --local mode for HISAT2 only, --score_min\
  \ is set as a linear function\n                         and is set as <L,value,value>.\n\
  \                         For instance, specifying L,0,-0.2 sets the minimum-score\
  \ function f to f(x) = 0 + (-0.2) * x, where x\n                         is the\
  \ read length. The default for end-to-end (global) alignments is: L,0,-0.2.\n  \
  \                       \n                         In --local mode for Bowtie 2,\
  \ the function is logarithmic and is set as <G,value,value>. For instance, specifying\n\
  \                         G,20,8 sets the minimum-score function f to f(x) = 20\
  \ + 8 * ln(x), where x is the read length.\n                         The default\
  \ is for local alignments in Bowtie 2 mode is: G,20,8.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n        \
  \                 See also: setting function options at http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2.\n\
  \n--rdg <int1>,<int2>      Sets the read gap open (<int1>) and extend (<int2>) penalties.\
  \ A read gap of length N gets a penalty\n                         of <int1> + N\
  \ * <int2>. Default: 5, 3.\n\n--rfg <int1>,<int2>      Sets the reference gap open\
  \ (<int1>) and extend (<int2>) penalties. A reference gap of length N gets\n   \
  \                      a penalty of <int1> + N * <int2>. Default: 5, 3.\n\n\n\n\
  Bismark BAM/SAM OUTPUT (default):\n\n (1) QNAME  (seq-ID)\n (2) FLAG   (this flag\
  \ tries to take the strand a bisulfite read originated from into account (this is\
  \ different from ordinary DNA alignment flags!))\n (3) RNAME  (chromosome)\n (4)\
  \ POS    (start position)\n (5) MAPQ   (always 255 for use with Bowtie)\n (6) CIGAR\n\
