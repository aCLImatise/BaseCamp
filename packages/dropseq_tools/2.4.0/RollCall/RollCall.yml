  \  Required. \n\nINPUT_VCF=File                The input VCF.  Required. \n\nSAMPLE_FILE=File\
  \              A file containing a list of samples to filter the VCF by.  Has 1\
  \ column, 1 entry per row. \n                              Each entry is a single\
  \ sample name from the VCF.  If this list is not specified, then all\n         \
  \                     donors in the VCF are used.  Default value: null. \n\nOUTPUT=File\n\
  O=File                        The output file containing each donor in the input\
  \ SAMPLE_FILE and the relative fraction\n                              of the donor.\
  \  When run in private SNP mode, an additional column REP_IRVs is emitted. \n  \
  \                            This is the fraction of the identifying rare alleles\
  \ - alleles that private to the donor\n                              and should\
  \ only be observed when the donor is present.  Required. \n\nVCF_OUTPUT=File   \
  \            Output a version of the VCF containing only the variants that have\
  \ coverage in the input\n                              BAM.  This file can be used\
  \ as the VCF input file on subsequent runs of the same data set\n              \
  \                to greatly speed up the run, if the same BAM is being analyzed\
  \ with different conditions. \n                              Default value: null.\
  \ \n\nSNP_COVERAGE_HISTOGRAM=File   Output a coverage report for the number of reads\
  \ on each SNP.  Bins SNPs by the number of\n                              reads.\
  \  Default value: null. \n\nGQ_THRESHOLD=Integer          The minimum genotype quality\
  \ for a variant.  Default value: 30. This option can be set to\n               \
  \               'null' to clear the default value. \n\nFRACTION_SAMPLES_PASSING=Double\n\
  \                              At least  samples must have genotype scores >= GQ_THRESHOLD\
  \ for the variant in the VCF to\n                              be included in the\
  \ analysis.  Default value: 0.9. This option can be set to 'null' to\n         \
  \                     clear the default value. \n\nIGNORED_CHROMOSOMES=String  \
  \  A list of chromosomes to omit from the analysis.  The default is to omit the\
  \ sex\n                              chromosomes.  Default value: [X, Y, MT]. This\
  \ option can be set to 'null' to clear the\n                              default\
  \ value. This option may be specified 0 or more times. This option can be set to\n\
  \                              'null' to clear the default list. \n\nREAD_MQ=Integer\
  \               The map quality of the read to be included.  Default value: 10.\
  \ This option can be set to\n                              'null' to clear the default\
  \ value. \n\nMIN_BASE_QUALITY=Integer      The minimum base quality of the SNP base\
  \ on the read  Default value: 10. This option can\n                            \
  \  be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nKNOWN_DONOR_TAG=String     \
  \   This option is intended to make evaluation of the algorithm easier when supplied\
  \ proper\n                              training data.  When tagging reads from\
  \ known donors with the KNOWN_DONOR_TAG and\n                              synthetically\
  \ mixing them to evalutate the algorithm, this counts the number of reads\n    \
  \                          observed with the tag per donor.  Non-informative reads\
  \ (low map quality, PCR duplicates)\n                              are not counted.\
  \ Reads are only counted on contigs for which there is at least one SNP\n      \
  \                        present in the VCF (minus IGNORED_CHROMOSOES that are ignored)\
  \ that could inform the data.\n                              This tends to exclude\
  \ bait contigs and alternative haplotypes.  Default value: null. \n\nOUTPUT_VERBOSE=File\
  \           Output of each SNP record with the sample that is variant and the allele\
  \ counts.  Only\n                              works for private SNP analysis (COMMON_SNP_ANALYSIS=false)\

  \ number of reads, skip it.  Default value: null. \n\n"
