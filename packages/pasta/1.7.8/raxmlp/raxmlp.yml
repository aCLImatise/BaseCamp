  \ to define \n              stem regions and pseudoknots\n\n      -t      Specify\
  \ a user starting tree file name in Newick format\n\n      -T      PTHREADS VERSION\
  \ ONLY! Specify the number of threads you want to run.\n              Make sure\
  \ to set \"-T\" to at most the number of CPUs you have on your machine,\n      \
  \        otherwise, there will be a huge performance decrease!\n\n      -v     \
  \ Display version information\n\n      -w      Name of the working directory where\
  \ RAxML will write its output files\n\n              DEFAULT: current directory\n\
  \n      -x      Specify an integer number (random seed) and turn on rapid bootstrapping\n\
  \              CAUTION: unlike in version 7.0.4 RAxML will conduct rapid BS replicates\
  \ under \n              the model of rate heterogeneity you specified via \"-m\"\
  \ and not by default under CAT\n\n      -y      If you want to only compute a parsimony\

  \ -Y      Do a more thorough parsimony tree search using a parsimony ratchet and\
  \ exit. \n              specify the number of ratchet searches via \"-#\" or \"\

  \   Specify the file name of a file containing multiple trees e.g. from a bootstrap\n\
  \              that shall be used to draw bipartition values onto a tree provided\
  \ with \"-t\",\n              It can also be used to compute per site log likelihoods\

  \ the number of alternative runs on distinct starting trees\n              In combination\
  \ with the \"-b\" option, this will invoke a multiple boostrap analysis\n      \
  \        Note that \"-N\" has been added as an alternative since \"-#\" sometimes\
  \ caused problems\n              with certain MPI job submission systems, since\
