help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\nSNPsplit_genome_preparation is designed to read in a\
  \ variant call files from the Mouse Genomes Project (e.g. this latest\nfile: 'mgp.v5.merged.snps_all.dbSNP142.vcf.gz')\
  \ and generate new genome versions where the strain SNPs are either incorporated\n\
  into the new genome (full sequence) or masked by the ambiguity nucleo-base 'N' (N-masking).\n\
  \nSNPsplit_genome_preparation may be run in two different modes:\n\nSingle strain\
  \ mode:\n\n   1) The VCF file is read and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in the\
  \ strain specified with --strain <name>\n   2) The reference genome (given with\
  \ --reference_genome <genome>) is read into memory, and the filtered high-\n   \
  \   confidence SNP positions are incorporated either as N-masking (default) or full\
  \ sequence (option --full_sequence)\n\nDual strain mode:\n\n   1) The VCF file is\
  \ read and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in the strain specified with --strain\
  \ <name>\n   2) The reference genome (given with --reference_genome <genome>) is\
  \ read into memory, and the filtered high-\n      confidence SNP positions are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n   3) The VCF file is read one more\
  \ time and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in strain 2 specified with --strain2\
  \ <name>\n   4) The filtered high-confidence SNP positions of strain 2 are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n   5) The SNP information of strain\
  \ and strain 2 relative to the reference genome build are compared, and a new Ref/SNP\n\
  \      annotation is constructed whereby the new Ref/SNP information will be Strain/Strain2\
  \ (and no longer the standard\n      reference genome strain Black6 (C57BL/6J))\n\
  \   6) The full genome sequence given with --strain <name> is read into memory,\
  \ and the high-confidence SNP positions between\n      Strain and Strain2 are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n\nThe resulting .fa files are ready\
  \ to be indexed with your favourite aligner. Proved and tested aligners include\
  \ Bowtie2,\nTophat, STAR, Hisat2, HiCUP and Bismark. Please note that STAR and Hisat2\
  \ may require you to disable soft-clipping, please\nrefer to the SNPsplit manual\
  \ for more details\n\nBoth the SNP filtering as well as the genome preparation write\
  \ out little report files for record keeping.\nPlease note that the SNPsplit genome\
  \ preparation writes out files and creates new folders for the SNPs and new genomes\
  \ into\nthe current working directory, so move there before invoking SNPsplit_genome_preparation.\n\
  \n\n  USAGE:    SNPsplit_genome_preparation  [options] --vcf_file <file> --reference_genome\
  \ /path/to/genome/ --strain <strain_name>\n\n\n--vcf_file <file>             Mandatory\

  \                              tweaking. SNP calls are read from the VCF files,\
  \ and high confidence SNPs are written into\n                              a folder\
