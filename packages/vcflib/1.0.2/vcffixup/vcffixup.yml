help_text: "usage: vcffixup <vcf file>\n\nGenerates a VCF stream where AC and NS have\
  \ been generated for each record using sample genotypes\n\n\n\nCount the allele\
  \ frequencies across alleles present in each record in the VCF file. (Similar to\
  \ vcftools --freq.)\n\nUses genotypes from the VCF file to correct AC (alternate\
  \ allele count), AF\n(alternate allele frequency), NS (number of called), in the\
  \ VCF records.  For\nexample:\n\n    % vcfkeepsamples file.vcf NA12878 | vcffixup\
  \ - | vcffilter -f \"AC > 0\"\n\nWould downsample file.vcf to only NA12878, removing\
  \ sites for which the sample\nwas not called as polymorphic.\n\nType: transformation\n\
