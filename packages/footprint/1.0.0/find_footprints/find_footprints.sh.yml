  \nThe arguments are explained below:\n\n    bam_file:\n        The bam file from\
  \ the ATAC-seq or DNase-seq experiment.\n\n    chrom_sizes:\n        A tab delimited\
  \ file with 2 columns, where the first column is\n        the chromosome name and\
  \ the second column is the chromosome\n        length for the appropriate organism\
  \ and genome build.\n\n    motif_coords:\n        A 6-column bed file with the coordinates\
  \ of motif matches (eg\n        resulting from scanning the genome with a PWM) for\
  \ the\n        transcription factor of interest. The 6 columns should contain\n\
  \        chromosome, start coordinate, end coordinate, name, score and\n       \
  \ strand information in this order. The coordinates should be\n        closed (1-based).\n\
  \n    genome_fasta:\n        A multi-fasta format file that contains the whole genome\n\
  \        sequence for the appropriate organism and genome build. This\n        file\
  \ should be indexed (eg by using samtools faidx) and placed\n        in the same\
  \ directory.\n\n    factor_name:\n        The name of the transcription factor of\
  \ interest supplied by\n        the user. This is used in the naming of the output\
  \ files.\n\n    bias_file:\n        A file listing the cleavage/transposition bias\
  \ of the\n        different protocols, for all 6-mers. Provided options: ATAC,\n\
  \        DNase double hit or DNase single hit protocols.\n\n    peak_file:\n   \
  \     A file with the coordinates of the ChIP-seq peaks for the\n        transcription\
  \ factor of interest. The format is flexible as\n        long as the first 3 columns\
  \ (chromosome, start coordinate, end\n        coordinate) are present.\n\n    no_of_components:\n\
  \        Total number of footprint and background components that\n        should\
  \ be learned from the data. Options are 2 (1 fp and 1 bg)\n        and 3 (2 fp and\
  \ 1 bg) components.\n\n    background:\n       The mode of initialization for the\
  \ background\n       component. Options are \"Flat\" or \"Seq\". Choosing \"Flat\"\
  \n       initializes this component as a uniform distribution. Choosing\n      \
  \ \"Seq\" initializes it as the signal profile that would be\n       expected solely\
  \ due to the protocol bias (given by the\n       bias_file parameter).\n\n    fixed_bg:\n\
  \       Whether the background component should be kept fixed. Options\n       are\
  \ TRUE/T or FALSE/F. Setting \"TRUE\" keeps this component\n       fixed, whereas\
  \ setting \"FALSE\" lets it be reestimated during\n       training.\n\n"
