help_text: "NAME\n    bp_fast_load_gff.pl - Fast-load a Bio::DB::GFF database from\
  \ GFF files.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n      % bp_fast_load_gff.pl -d testdb dna1.fa dna2.fa\
  \ features1.gff features2.gff ...\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    This script loads a Bio::DB::GFF\
  \ database with the features contained in\n    a list of GFF files and/or FASTA\
  \ sequence files. You must use the exact\n    variant of GFF described in Bio::DB::GFF.\
  \ Various command-line options\n    allow you to control which database to load\
  \ and whether to allow an\n    existing database to be overwritten.\n\n    This\
  \ script is similar to load_gff.pl, but is much faster. However, it\n    is hard-coded\
  \ to use MySQL and probably only works on Unix platforms due\n    to its reliance\
  \ on pipes. See bp_load_gff.pl for an incremental loader\n    that works with all\
  \ databases supported by Bio::DB::GFF, and\n    bp_bulk_load_gff.pl for a fast MySQL\
  \ loader that supports all platforms.\n\n  NOTES\n    If the filename is given as\
  \ \"-\" then the input is taken from standard\n    input. Compressed files (.gz,\
  \ .Z, .bz2) are automatically uncompressed.\n\n    FASTA format files are distinguished\
  \ from GFF files by their filename\n    extensions. Files ending in .fa, .fasta,\
  \ .fast, .seq, .dna and their\n    uppercase variants are treated as FASTA files.\
  \ Everything else is\n    treated as a GFF file. If you wish to load -fasta files\
  \ from STDIN, then\n    use the -f command-line swith with an argument of '-', as\
  \ in\n\n        gunzip my_data.fa.gz | bp_fast_load_gff.pl -d test -f -\n\n    The\
  \ nature of the load requires that the database be on the local\n    machine and\
  \ that the indicated user have the \"file\" privilege to load\n    the tables and\
  \ have enough room in /usr/tmp (or whatever is specified by\n    the \\$TMPDIR environment\
  \ variable), to hold the tables transiently. If\n    your MySQL is version 3.22.6\
  \ and was compiled using the \"load local\n    file\" option, then you may be able\
  \ to load remote databases with local\n    data using the --local option.\n\n  \
  \  About maxfeature: the default value is 100,000,000 bases. If you have\n    features\
  \ that are close to or greater that 100Mb in length, then the\n    value of maxfeature\
  \ should be increased to 1,000,000,000. This value\n    must be a power of 10.\n\
  \n    If the list of GFF or fasta files exceeds the kernel limit for the\n    maximum\
  \ number of command-line arguments, use the --long_list\n    /path/to/files option.\n\
  \n    The adaptor used is dbi::mysqlopt. There is currently no way to change\n \
  \   this.\n\nCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS\n    Command-line options can be abbreviated to\
  \ single-letter options. e.g.\n    -d instead of --database.\n\n       --database\
  \ <dsn>      Mysql database name\n       --create              Reinitialize/create\
  \ data tables without asking\n       --local               Try to load a remote\
  \ database using local data.\n       --user                Username to log in as\n\
  \       --fasta               File or directory containing fasta files to load\n\
  \       --password            Password to use for authentication\n       --long_list\
