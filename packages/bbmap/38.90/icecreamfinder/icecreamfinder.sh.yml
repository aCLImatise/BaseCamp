help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 6, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Finds PacBio reads containing inverted repeats.\nThese are candidate triangle\
  \ reads (ice cream cones).\nEither ice cream cones only, or all inverted repeats,\
  \ can be filtered.\n\nUsage:  icecreamfinder.sh in=<input file> out=<output file>\
  \ outb=<bad reads>\n\nFile I/O parameters:\nin=<file>       Primary input.\nout=<file>\
  \      (outgood) Output for good reads.\nouta=<file>     (outambig) Output for with\
  \ inverted repeats, but it is unclear\n                whether that is natural or\
  \ artifactual.\noutb=<file>     (outbad) Output for reads suspected as chimeric.\n\
  outj=<file>     (outjunction) Output for junctions in inverted repeat reads.\nstats=<file>\
  \    Print screen output here instead of to the screen.\njson=f          Print stats\
  \ as json.\nasrhist=<file>  Adapter alignment score ratio histogram.\nirsist=<file>\
  \   Inverted repeat alignment score ratio histogram.\nambig=          Determine\
  \ where ambiguous reads are sent.  They will ALWAYS\n                be sent to\
  \ outa if specified.  If not, they will be sent\n                to outg (good)\
  \ unless overridden by this flag.  Options:\n                   ambig=good:  Send\
  \ ambiguous reads to outg.\n                   ambig=bad:  Send ambiguous reads\
  \ to outb.\n                   ambig=good,bad:  Send ambiguous reads to outg and\
  \ outb.\n                   ambig=null:  Do not send to outg or outb.\noverwrite=f\
  \     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than\n            \
  \    overwrite an existing file.\nziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through\
  \ 9 (max) to change compression\n                level; lower compression is faster.\n\
  \nProcessing parameters:\nalignrc=t       Align the reverse-complement of the read\
  \ to itself to look \n                for inverted repeats.\nalignadapter=t  Align\
  \ adapter sequence to reads.\nadapter=        default: ATCTCTCTCAACAACAACAACGGAGGAGGAGGAAAAGAGAGAGAT\n\
  icecreamonly=t  (ico) Only remove suspected triangle reads.  Otherwise, all\n  \
  \              inverted repeats are removed.\nksr=t           (keepshortreads) Keep\
  \ non-triangle reads from triangle ZMWs.\nkzt=f           (keepzmwstogether) Send\
  \ all reads from a ZMW to the same file.\ntargetqlen=352  (qlen) Make queries of\
  \ this length from a read tip.\nqlenfraction=0.15   Try to make queries at most\
  \ this fraction of read length.\n                For short reads this will override\
  \ targetqlen.\nminlen=40       Do not output reads shorter than this, after trimming.\n\
  minqlen=100     Do not make queries shorter than this.  For very short\n       \
  \         reads this will override qlenfraction.\nshortfraction=0.4   Only declare\
  \ a read to be a triangle if the short half \n                of the repeat is at\
  \ least this fraction of read length.\nccs=f           Input reads are CCS, meaning\
  \ they are all full-pass.\n                In this case you should increase minratio.\n\
  trim=t          Trim adapter sequence from read tips.\ntrimpolya=f     Trim terminal\
  \ poly-A and poly-T sequences, for some isoseq\n                libraries.\nminpolymer=5\
  \    Don't trim poly-A sequence shorter than this.\npolyerror=0.2   Max error rate\
  \ for trimming poly-A.\n\n\nSpeed and sensitivity:\njni=f           Enable C code\
  \ for higher speed and identical results.\nminratio=       Fraction of maximal alignment\
  \ score to consider as matching.\n                Higher is more stringent; lower\
  \ allows more sequencing errors.\n                This is VERY SENSITIVE.  For error-corrected\
  \ reads it should\n                be set higher.  It is roughly the expected identity\
  \ of one\n                read to another (double the per-read error rate).\nminratio1=0.59\
  \  Set minratio for the first alignment pass only.\nminratio2=0.64  Set minratio\
  \ for the second alignment pass only.\nadapterratio=0.18   Initial adapter detection\
  \ sensitivity; affects speed.\nadapterratio2=.325  Final adapter detection sensitivity.\n\
  minscore=-800   Exit alignment early if score drops below this.\n\nEntropy parameters\
  \ (recommended setting is 'entropy=t'):\nminentropy=-1   Set to 0.4 or above to\
  \ remove low-entropy reads;\n                range is 0-1, recommended value is\
  \ 0.55.  0.7 is too high.\n                Negative numbers disable this function.\n\
  entropyk=3      Kmer length for entropy calculation.\nentropylen=350  Reads with\
  \ entropy below cutoff for at least this many\n                consecutive bases\
  \ will be removed.\nentropyfraction=0.5     Alternative minimum length for short\
  \ reads; the shorter\n                        of entropylen and entfraction*readlength\
  \ will be used.\nentropywindow=50        Window size used for entropy calculation.\n\
  maxmonomerfraction=0.74 (mmf) Also require this fraction of bases in each\n    \
  \                    window to be the same base.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx     \
  \       This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n         \
  \       -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n               \
  \ specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom        \
  \   This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n             \
  \   exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
