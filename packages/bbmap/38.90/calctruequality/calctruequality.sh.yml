help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified March 21, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Calculates observed quality scores from mapped sam/bam files.\nGenerates matrices\
  \ for use in recalibrating quality scores.  By default, \nthe matrices are written\
  \ to /ref/qual/ in the current directory.\n\nIf you have multiple sam/bam files\
  \ demultiplexed from a single sequencing run,\nit is recommended to use all of them\
  \ as input for increased statistical power.\nOnce the matrices are generated, recalibration\
  \ can be done on mapped or\nunmapped reads; you may get better results by recalibrating\
  \ the fastq and \nremapping the calibrated reads.\n\nNote!  Diploid organisms with\
  \ a high heterozygousity rate will induce\ninaccurate recalibration at the high\
  \ end of the quality scale unless SNP\nlocations are masked or variations are called.\
  \  For example, recalibrating \nhuman reads mapped to an unmasked human reference\
  \ would generate an \nexpected maximal Q-score of roughly 30 due to the human 1/1000\
  \ SNP rate.\nVariations can be ignored by using the callvars flag or providing\n\
  a file of variations.\n\nUsage:\n\nStep 1.  Generate matrices (from mapped sam or\
  \ bam files):\ncalctruequality.sh in=<file,file,...file> path=<directory>\n\nStep\
  \ 2.  Recalibrate reads (any kind of files):\nbbduk.sh in=<file> out=<file> recalibrate\n\
  \n\nParameters (and their defaults)\n\nInput parameters:\nin=<file,file>      Sam\
  \ file or comma-delimited list of files.  Alignments \n                    must\
  \ use = and X cigar symbols, or have MD tags, or\n                    ref must be\
  \ specified.\nreads=-1            Stop after processing this many reads (if positive).\n\
  samstreamer=t       (ss) Load reads multithreaded to increase speed.\nunpigz=t \
  \           Use pigz to decompress.\n\nOutput parameters:\noverwrite=t         (ow)\
  \ Set to true to allow overwriting of existing files.\npath=.              Directory\
  \ to write quality matrices (within /ref subdir).\nwrite=t             Write matrices.\n\
  showstats=t         Print a summary.\npigz=f              Use pigz to compress.\n\
  \nOther parameters:\nt=auto              Number of worker threads.\npasses=2   \
  \         Recalibration passes, 1 or 2.  2 is slower but gives more\n          \
  \          accurate quality scores.\nrecalqmax=42        Adjust max quality scores\
  \ tracked.  The actual highest\n                    quality score allowed is recalqmax-1.\n\
  trackall=f          Track all available quality metrics and produce all\n      \
  \              matrices, including the ones that are not selected for \n       \
  \             quality adjustment.  Reduces speed, but allows testing the\n     \
  \               effects of different recalibration matrices.\nindels=t         \
  \   Include indels in quality calculations.\n\nVariation calling:\nvarfile=<file>\
  \      Use the variants in this var file, instead of calling\n                 \
  \   variants.  The format can be produced by CallVariants.\nvcf=<file>         \
  \ Use the variants in this VCF file, instead of\n                    calling variants.\n\
  callvars=f          Call SNPs, and do not count them as errors.\nploidy=1      \
  \      Set the organism's ploidy.\nref=                Required for variation-calling.\n\
  \n*** 'Variant-Calling Cutoffs' flags in callvariants.sh are also supported ***\n\
  \nSelecting matrices:\nloadq102=           For each recalibration matrix, enable\
  \ or disable that matrix with t/f.\n                    You can specify pass1 or\
  \ pass2 like this: loadq102_p1=f loadq102_p2=t.\n                    The default\
  \ is loadqbp_p1=t loadqbp_p2=t loadqb123_p=t.\nclearmatrices=f     If true, clear\
  \ all the existing matrix selections.  For example:\n                    'clearmatrices\
  \ loadqbp_p1'\n                    This would ignore defaults and select only qbp\
  \ for the first pass.\n\nAvailable matrices:\nq102                Quality, leading\
  \ quality, trailing quality.\nqap                 Quality, average quality, position.\n\
  qbp                 Quality, current base, position.\nq10                 Quality,\
  \ leading quality.\nq12                 Quality, trailing quality.\nqb12       \
  \         Quality, leading base, current base.\nqb012               Quality, two\
  \ leading bases, current base.\nqb123               Quality, leading base, current\
  \ base, trailing base.\nqb234               Quality, current base, two trailing\
  \ bases.\nq12b12              Quality, trailing quality, leading base, current base.\n\
  qp                  Quality, position.\nq                   Current quality score\
  \ only.\n\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx                This will set Java's memory usage,\
  \ overriding autodetection.\n                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of\
  \ RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n                    The max is typically\
  \ 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom               This flag will cause the process\
  \ to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java\
  \ 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
