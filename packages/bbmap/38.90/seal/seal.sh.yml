help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified March 28, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Performs high-speed alignment-free sequence quantification,\nby counting the\
  \ number of long kmers that match between a read and\na set of reference sequences.\
  \  Designed for RNA-seq with alternative splicing.\nPlease read bbmap/docs/guides/SealGuide.txt\
  \ for more information.\n\nUsage:  seal.sh in=<input file> ref=<file,file,file...>\
  \ rpkm=<file>\n\nInput may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.\nIf you\
  \ pipe via stdin/stdout, please include the file type; e.g. for gzipped \nfasta\
  \ input, set in=stdin.fa.gz\n\nInput parameters:\nin=<file>           Main input.\
  \ in=stdin.fq will pipe from stdin.\nin2=<file>          Input for 2nd read of pairs\
  \ in a different file.\nref=<file,file>     Comma-delimited list of reference files\
  \ or directories.\n                    Filenames may also be used without ref=,\
  \ e.g. *.fa.\n                    In addition to filenames, you may also use the\
  \ keywords:\n                    adapters, artifacts, phix, lambda, pjet, mtst,\
  \ kapa.\nliteral=<seq,seq>   Comma-delimited list of literal reference sequences.\n\
  touppercase=f       (tuc) Change all bases upper-case.\ninterleaved=auto    (int)\
  \ t/f overrides interleaved autodetection.\nqin=auto            Input quality offset:\
  \ 33 (Sanger), 64, or auto.\nreads=-1            If positive, quit after processing\
  \ X reads or pairs.\ncopyundefined=f     (cu) Process non-AGCT IUPAC reference bases\
  \ by making all\n                    possible unambiguous copies.  Intended for\
  \ short motifs\n                    or adapter barcodes, as time/memory use is exponential.\n\
  \nOutput parameters:\nout=<file>          (outmatch) Write reads here that contain\
  \ kmers matching\n                    the reference. 'out=stdout.fq' will pipe to\
  \ standard out.\nout2=<file>         (outmatch2) Use this to write 2nd read of pairs\
  \ to a \n                    different file.\noutu=<file>         (outunmatched)\
  \ Write reads here that do not contain kmers \n                    matching the\
  \ database.\noutu2=<file>        (outunmatched2) Use this to write 2nd read of pairs\
  \ to a \n                    different file.\npattern=<file>      Use this to write\
  \ reads to one stream per ref sequence\n                    match, replacing the\
  \ % character with the sequence name.\n                    For example, pattern=%.fq\
  \ for ref sequences named dog and \n                    cat would create dog.fq\
  \ and cat.fq.\nstats=<file>        Write statistics about which contamininants were\
  \ detected.\nrefstats=<file>     Write statistics on a per-reference-file basis.\n\

  \         Dump kmer tables to a file, in fasta format.\nnzo=t               Only\
  \ write statistics about ref sequences with nonzero hits.\noverwrite=t         (ow)\
  \ Grant permission to overwrite files.\nshowspeed=t         (ss) 'f' suppresses\
  \ display of processing speed.\nziplevel=2          (zl) Compression level; 1 (min)\
  \ through 9 (max).\nfastawrap=80        Length of lines in fasta output.\nqout=auto\
  \           Output quality offset: 33 (Sanger), 64, or auto.\nstatscolumns=5   \
  \   (cols) Number of columns for stats output, 3 or 5.\n                    5 includes\
  \ base counts.\nrename=f            Rename reads to indicate which sequences they\
  \ matched.\nrefnames=f          Use names of reference files rather than scaffold\
  \ IDs.\n                    With multiple reference files, this is more efficient\n\
  \                    than tracking statistics on a per-sequence basis.\ntrd=f  \
  \             Truncate read and ref names at the first whitespace.\nordered=f  \
  \         Set to true to output reads in same order as input.\nkpt=t           \
  \    (keepPairsTogether) Paired reads will always be assigned\n                \
  \    to the same ref sequence.\n\nProcessing parameters:\nk=31                Kmer\
  \ length used for finding contaminants.  Contaminants \n                    shorter\
  \ than k will not be found.  k must be at least 1.\nrcomp=t             Look for\
  \ reverse-complements of kmers in addition to \n                    forward kmers.\n\
  maskmiddle=t        (mm) Treat the middle base of a kmer as a wildcard, to \n  \
  \                  increase sensitivity in the presence of errors.\nminkmerhits=1\
  \       (mkh) A read needs at least this many kmer hits to be \n               \
  \     considered a match.\nminkmerfraction=0.0 (mkf) A reads needs at least this\
  \ fraction of its total\n                    kmers to hit a ref, in order to be\
  \ considered a match.\nhammingdistance=0   (hdist) Maximum Hamming distance for\
  \ ref kmers (subs only).\n                    Memory use is proportional to (3*K)^hdist.\n\
  qhdist=0            Hamming distance for query kmers; impacts speed, not memory.\n\
  editdistance=0      (edist) Maximum edit distance from ref kmers (subs and \n  \
  \                  indels).  Memory use is proportional to (8*K)^edist.\nforbidn=f\
  \           (fn) Forbids matching of read kmers containing N.  \n              \
  \      By default, these will match a reference 'A' if hdist>0\n               \
  \     or edist>0, to increase sensitivity.\nmatch=all           Determines when\
  \ to quit looking for kmer matches.  Values:\n                         all:    Attempt\
  \ to match all kmers in each read.\n                         first:  Quit after\
  \ the first matching kmer.\n                         unique: Quit after the first\
  \ uniquely matching kmer.\nambiguous=random    (ambig) Set behavior on ambiguously-mapped\
  \ reads (with an\n                    equal number of kmer matches to multiple sequences).\n\
  \                         first:  Use the first best-matching sequence.\n      \
  \                   toss:   Consider unmapped.\n                         random:\
  \ Select one best-matching sequence randomly.\n                         all:   \
  \ Use all best-matching sequences.\nclearzone=0         (cz) Threshhold for ambiguity.\
  \  If the best match shares X \n                    kmers with the read, the read\
  \ will be considered\n                    also ambiguously mapped to any sequence\
  \ sharing at least\n                    [X minus clearzone] kmers.\necco=f     \
  \         For overlapping paired reads only.  Performs error-\n                \
  \    correction with BBMerge prior to kmer operations.\n\nContainment parameters:\n\
  processcontainedref=f  Require a reference sequence to be fully contained by\n \
  \                   an input sequence\nstorerefbases=f     Store reference bases\
  \ so that ref containments can be\n                    validated.  If this is set\
  \ to false and processcontainedref\n                    is true, then it will only\
  \ require that the read share the\n                    same number of bases as are\
  \ present in the ref sequence.\n\nTaxonomy parameters (only use when doing taxonomy):\n\
  tax=<file>          Output destination for taxonomy information.\ntaxtree=<file>\
  \      (tree) A serialized TaxTree (tree.taxtree.gz).\ngi=<file>           A serialized\
  \ GiTable (gitable.int1d.gz). Only needed if \n                    reference sequence\
  \ names start with 'gi|'.\nmincount=1          Only display taxa with at least this\
  \ many hits.\nmaxnodes=-1         If positive, display at most this many top hits.\n\

  \ and Memory parameters:\nthreads=auto        (t) Set number of threads to use;\
  \ default is number of \n                    logical processors.\nprealloc=f   \
  \       Preallocate memory in table.  Allows faster table loading \n           \
  \         and more efficient memory usage, for a large reference.\nmonitor=f   \
  \        Kill this process if CPU usage drops to zero for a long\n             \
  \       time.  monitor=600,0.01 would kill after 600 seconds \n                \
  \    under 1% usage.\nrskip=1             Skip reference kmers to reduce memory\
  \ usage.\n                    1 means use all, 2 means use every other kmer, etc.\n\
  qskip=1             Skip query kmers to increase speed.  1 means use all.\nspeed=0\
  \             Ignore this fraction of kmer space (0-15 out of 16) in both\n    \
  \                reads and reference.  Increases speed and reduces memory.\nNote:\
