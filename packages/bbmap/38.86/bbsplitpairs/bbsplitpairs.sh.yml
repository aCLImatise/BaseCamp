help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified February 17, 2015\n\nDescription:\
  \  Separates paired reads into files of 'good' pairs and 'good' singletons by removing\
  \ 'bad' reads that are shorter than a min length.\nDesigned to handle situations\
  \ where reads become too short to be useful after trimming.  This program also optionally\
  \ performs quality trimming.\n\nUsage:        bbsplitpairs.sh in=<input file> out=<pair\
  \ output file> outs=<singleton output file> minlen=<minimum read length, an integer>\n\
  \nInput may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.\n\nOptional parameters\
  \ (and their defaults)\n\nin=<file>           The 'in=' flag is needed if the input\
  \ file is not the first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.\nin2=<file>\
  \          Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.\nout=<file>  \
  \        The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the second parameter.\
  \  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.\nout2=<file>         Use this to write\
  \ 2nd read of pairs to a different file.\noutsingle=<file>    (outs) Write singleton\
  \ reads here.\n\noverwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort\
  \ rather than overwrite an existing file.\nshowspeed=t         (ss) Set to 'f' to\
  \ suppress display of processing speed.\ninterleaved=auto    (int) If true, forces\
  \ fastq input to be paired and interleaved.\nqtrim=f             Trim read ends\
  \ to remove bases with quality below trimq.\n                    Values: rl (trim\
  \ both ends), f (neither end), r (right end only), l (left end only).\ntrimq=6 \
  \            Trim quality threshold.\nminlen=20           (ml) Reads shorter than\
  \ this after trimming will be discarded.\nziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest)\
  \ through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression is faster.\nfixinterleaving=f\
  \   (fint) Fixes corrupted interleaved files by examining pair names.  Only use\
  \ on files with broken interleaving.\nrepair=f            (rp) Fixes arbitrarily\
  \ corrupted paired reads by examining read names.  High memory.\nain=f         \
  \      (allowidenticalnames) When detecting pair names, allows identical names,\
  \ instead of requiring /1 and /2 or 1: and 2:\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx        \
  \        This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n        \
  \            -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200\
  \ megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom\
  \               This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n               \
  \     out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da               \
  \  Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if\
  \ you encounter any problems.\n\n"
