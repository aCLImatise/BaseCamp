help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified Jan 7, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Compares query sketches to others, and prints their kmer identity.\nThe input\
  \ can be sketches made by sketch.sh, or fasta/fastq files.\nIt's recommended to\
  \ first sketch references with sketch.sh for large files,\nor when taxonomic information\
  \ is desired.\n\nPlease read bbmap/docs/guides/BBSketchGuide.txt for more information.\n\
  \nUsage:  comparesketch.sh in=<file,file,file...> ref=<file,file,file...>\nAlternative:\
  \  comparesketch.sh in=<file,file,file...> file file file\nAlternative:  comparesketch.sh\
  \ in=<file,file,file...> *.sketch\nAlternative:  comparesketch.sh alltoall *.sketch.gz\n\
  \nFile parameters:\nin=<file,file...>   Sketches or fasta files to compare.\nout=stdout\
  \          Comparison output.  Can be set to a file instead.\noutsketch=<file> \
  \   Optionally write sketch files generated from the input.\nref=<file,file...>\
  \  List of sketches to compare against.  Files given without\n                 \
  \   a prefix (ref=) will be treated as references,\n                    so you can\
  \ use *.sketch without ref=.\n                    You can also do ref=nt#.sketch\
  \ to load all numbered files\n                    fitting that pattern.\n      \
  \              On NERSC, you can use these abbreviations (e.g. ref=nt):\n      \
  \                 nt:      nt sketches\n                       refseq:  Refseq sketches\n\
  \                       silva:   Silva sketches\n                       img:   \
  \  IMG sketches\n                       mito:    RefSeq mitochondrial sketches\n\
  \                       fungi:   RefSeq fungi sketches\n                       protein:\
  \ RefSeq prokaryotic amino acid sketches\n                    Using an abbreviation\
  \ automatically sets the blacklist, \n                    and k.  If the reference\
  \ is in amino space, the query\n                    also be in amino acid space\
  \ with the flag amino added.\n                    If the query is in nucleotide\
  \ space, use the flag\n                    'translate', but this will only work\
  \ for prokaryotes.\n\nBlacklist and Whitelist parameters:\nblacklist=<file>    Ignore\
  \ keys in this sketch file.  Additionally, there are\n                    built-in\
  \ blacklists that can be specified:\n                       nt:      Blacklist for\
  \ nt\n                       refseq:  Blacklist for Refseq\n                   \
  \    silva:   Blacklist for Silva\n                       img:     Blacklist for\
  \ IMG\nwhitelist=f         Ignore keys that are not in the index.  Requires index=t.\n\
  \nSketch-making parameters:\nmode=perfile        Possible modes, for sequence input:\n\
  \                       single: Generate one sketch.\n                       sequence:\
  \ Generate one sketch per sequence.\n                       perfile: Generate one\
  \ sketch per file.\nsketchonly=f        Don't run comparisons, just write the output\
  \ sketch file.\nk=31                Kmer length, 1-32.  To maximize sensitivity\
  \ and \n                    specificity, dual kmer lengths may be used:  k=31,24\n\
  \                    Dual kmers are fastest if the shorter is a multiple \n    \
  \                of 4.  Query and reference k must match.\nsamplerate=1        Set\
  \ to a lower value to sample a fraction of input reads.\n                    For\
  \ raw reads (rather than an assembly), 1-3x coverage\n                    gives\
  \ best results, by reducing error kmers.  Somewhat\n                    higher is\
  \ better for high-error-rate data like PacBio.\nminkeycount=1       Ignore kmers\
  \ that occur fewer times than this.  Values\n                    over 1 can be used\
  \ with raw reads to avoid error kmers.\nminprob=0.0001      Ignore kmers below this\
  \ probability of correctness.\nminqual=0           Ignore kmers spanning bases below\
  \ this quality.\nentropy=0.66        Ignore sequence with entropy below this value.\n\
  merge=f             Merge paired reads prior to sketching.\namino=f            \
  \ Use amino acid mode.  Input should be amino acids.\ntranslate=f         Call genes\
  \ and translate to proteins.  Input should be\n                    nucleotides.\
  \  Designed for prokaryotes.\nsixframes=f         Translate all 6 frames instead\
  \ of predicting genes.\nssu=t               Scan for and retain full-length SSU\
  \ sequence.\nprintssusequence=f  Print the query SSU sequence (JSON mode only).\n\
  \nSize parameters:\nsize=10000          Desired size of sketches (if not using autosize).\n\
  mgf=0.01            (maxfraction) Max fraction of genomic kmers to use.\nminsize=100\
  \         Do not generate sketches for genomes smaller than this.\nautosize=t  \
  \        Use flexible sizing instead of fixed-length.  This is\n               \
  \     nonlinear; a human sketch is only ~6x a bacterial sketch.\nsizemult=1    \
  \      Multiply the autosized size of sketches by this factor.\n               \
  \     Normally a bacterial-size genome will get a sketch size\n                \
  \    of around 10000; if autosizefactor=2, it would be ~20000.\ndensity=       \
  \     If this flag is set (to a number between 0 and 1),\n                    autosize\
  \ and sizemult are ignored, and this fraction of\n                    genomic kmers\
  \ are used.  For example, at density=0.001,\n                    a 4.5Mbp bacteria\
  \ will get a 4500-kmer sketch.\nsketchheapfactor=4  If minkeycount>1, temporarily\
  \ track this many kmers until\n                    counts are known and low-count\
  \ kmers are discarded.\n\nSketch comparing parameters:\nthreads=auto        Use\
  \ this many threads for comparison.\nindex=auto          Index the sketches for\
  \ much faster searching.\n                    Requires more memory and adds startup\
  \ time.\n                    Recommended true for many query sketches, false for\
  \ few.\nprealloc=f          Preallocate the index for greater efficiency.\n    \
  \                Can be set to a number between 0 and 1 to determine how \n    \
  \                much of total memory should be used.\nalltoall            (ata)\
  \ Compare all refs to all.  Must be sketches.\ncompareself=f       In all-to-all\
  \ mode, compare a sketch to itself.\n\nTaxonomy-related parameters:\ntree=<file>\
  \         Specify a TaxTree file.  On Genepool, use tree=auto.\n               \
  \     Only necessary for use with printtaxa and level.\n                    Assumes\
  \ comparisons are done against reference sketches\n                    with known\
  \ taxonomy information.\nlevel=2             Only report the best record per taxa\
  \ at this level.\n                    Either level names or numbers may be used.\n\
  \                        0: disabled\n                        1: subspecies\n  \
  \                      2: species\n                        3: genus\n          \
  \             ...etc\ninclude=            Restrict output to organisms in these\
  \ clades.\n                    May be a comma-delimited list of names or NCBI TaxIDs.\n\
  includelevel=0      Promote the include list to this taxonomic level.\n        \
  \            For example, include=h.sapiens includelevel=phylum\n              \
  \      would only include organisms in the same phylum as human.\nincludestring=\
  \      Only report records whose name contains this string.\nexclude=          \
  \  Ignore organisms in these clades.\n                    May be a comma-delimited\
  \ list of names or NCBI TaxIDs.\nexcludelevel=0      Promote the exclude list to\
  \ this taxonomic level.\n                    For example, exclude=h.sapiens excludelevel=phylum\n\
  \                    would exclude all organisms in the same phylum as human.\n\
  excludestring=      Do not records whose name contains this string.\nminlevel= \
  \          Use this to restrict comparisons to distantly-related\n             \
  \       organisms.  Intended for finding misclassified organisms\n             \
  \       using all-to-all comparisons.  minlevel=order would only\n             \
  \       report hits between organisms related at the order level\n             \
  \       or higher, not between same species or genus.\nbanunclassified=f   Ignore\
  \ organisms descending from nodes like \n                    'unclassified Bacteria'\n\
  banvirus=f          Ignore viruses.\nrequiressu=f        Ignore records without\
  \ SSUs.\nminrefsize=0        Ignore ref sketches smaller than this (unique kmers).\n\
  minrefsizebases=0   Ignore ref sketches smaller than this (total base pairs).\n\n\

  \     (depth2) Print depth compensating for genomic repeats.\n                 \
  \   Requires reference sketches to be generated with depth.\nactualdepth=t     \
  \  If this is false, the raw average count is printed.\n                    If true,\
