help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 14, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Calls variants from sam or bam input.\nIn default mode, all input files are combined\
  \ and treated as a single sample.\nIn multisample mode, each file is treated as\
  \ an individual sample,\nand gets its own column in the VCF file.  Unless overridden,\
  \ input file\nnames are used as sample names.\nPlease read bbmap/docs/guides/CallVariantsGuide.txt\
  \ for more information,\nor bbmap/pipelines/variantPipeline.sh for a usage example.\n\
  \nUsage:  callvariants.sh in=<file,file,...> ref=<file> vcf=<file>\n\nInput may\
  \ be sorted or unsorted.\nThe reference should be fasta.\n\nI/O parameters:\nin=<file>\
  \       Input; may be one file or multiple comma-delimited files.\nlist=<file> \
  \    Optional text file containing one input file per line.\n                Use\
  \ list or in, but not both.\nout=<file>      Output variant list in var format.\
  \  If the name ends\n                with .vcf then it will be vcf format.\nvcf=<file>\
  \      Output variant list in vcf format.\noutgff=<file>   Output variant list in\
  \ gff format.\nref=<file>      Reference fasta.  Required to display ref alleles.\n\
  \                Variant calling wil be more accurate with the reference.\nvcfin=<file>\
  \    Force calls at these locations, even if allele count is 0.\nshist=<file>  \
  \  (scorehist) Output for variant score histogram.\nzhist=<file>    (zygosityhist)\
  \ Output for zygosity histogram.\nqhist=<file>    (qualityhist) Output for variant\
  \ base quality histogram.\noverwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program\
  \ to abort rather than\n                overwrite an existing file.\nextended=t\
  \      Print additional variant statistics columns.\nsample=         Optional comma-delimited\
  \ list of sample names.\nmultisample=f   (multi) Set to true if there are multiple\
  \ sam/bam files,\n                and each should be tracked as an individual sample.\n\
  vcf0=           Optional comma-delimited list of per-sample outputs.\n         \
  \       Only used in multisample mode.\nbgzip=t         Use bgzip for gzip compression.\n\
  samstreamer=t   (ss) Load reads multithreaded to increase speed.\n             \
  \   Disable to reduce the number of threads used.  The number of\n             \
  \   streamer threads can be set with e.g. 'ss=4'; default is 6.\nstreamermf=8  \
  \  (ssmf) Allow multiple sam files to be read simultaneously.\n                Set\
  \ ssmf=X to specify the maximum number or ssmf=f\n                to disable.\n\n\
  Processing Parameters:\nprefilter=f     Use a Bloom filter to exclude variants seen\
  \ fewer than\n                minreads times.  Doubles the runtime but greatly reduces\n\
  \                memory usage.  The results are identical.\ncoverage=t      (cc)\
  \ Calculate coverage, to better call variants.\nploidy=1        Set the organism's\
  \ ploidy.\nrarity=1.0      Penalize the quality of variants with allele fraction\
  \ \n                lower than this.  For example, if you are interested in\n  \
  \              4% frequency variants, you could set both rarity and\n          \
  \      minallelefraction to 0.04.  This is affected by ploidy - \n             \
  \   a variant with frequency indicating at least one copy\n                is never\
  \ penalized.\ncovpenalty=0.8  (lowcoveragepenalty) A lower penalty will increase\
  \ the \n                scores of low-coverage variants, and is useful for \n  \
  \              low-coverage datasets.\nuseidentity=t   Include average read identity\
  \ in score calculation.\nusepairing=t    Include pairing rate in score calculation.\n\
  usebias=t       Include strand bias in score calculation.\nuseedist=t      Include\
  \ read-end distance in score calculation.\nhomopolymer=t   Penalize scores of substitutions\
  \ matching adjacent bases.\nnscan=t         Consider the distance of a variant from\
  \ contig ends when \n                calculating strand bias.\ncallsub=t       Call\
  \ substitutions.\ncalldel=t       Call deletions.\ncallins=t       Call insertions.\n\
  calljunct=f     Call junctions (in development).\nnopassdot=f     Use . as genotype\
  \ for variations failing the filter.\n\nCoverage Parameters (these mainly affect\
  \ speed and memory use):\n32bit=f         Set to true to allow coverage tracking\
  \ over depth 65535,\n                which increases memory use.  Variant calls\
  \ are impacted\n                where coverage exceeds the maximum.\natomic=auto\
  \     Increases multithreaded speed; forces 32bit to true.\n                Defaults\
  \ to true if there are more than 8 threads.\nstrandedcov=f   (stranded) Tracks per-strand\
  \ ref coverage to print the MCOV\n                and DP4 fields.  Requires more\
  \ memory when enabled.  Strand\n                of variant reads is tracked regardless\
  \ of this flag.\n\nTrimming parameters:\nborder=5        Trim at least this many\
  \ bases on both ends of reads.\nqtrim=r         Quality-trim reads on this end\n\
  \                   r: right, l: left, rl: both, f: don't quality-trim.\ntrimq=10\
  \        Quality-trim bases below this score.\n\nRealignment parameters:\nrealign=f\
  \       Realign all reads with more than a couple mismatches.\n                Decreases\
  \ speed.  Recommended for aligners other than BBMap.\nunclip=f        Convert clip\
  \ symbols from exceeding the ends of the\n                realignment zone into\
  \ matches and substitutitions.\nrepadding=70    Pad alignment by this much on each\
  \ end.  Typically,\n                longer is more accurate for long indels, but\
  \ greatly\n                reduces speed.\nrerows=602      Use this many rows maximum\
  \ for realignment.  Reads longer\n                than this cannot be realigned.\n\
  recols=2000     Reads may not be aligned to reference seqments longer \n       \
  \         than this.  Needs to be at least read length plus\n                max\
  \ deletion length plus twice padding.\nmsa=            Select the aligner.  Options:\n\
  \                   MultiStateAligner11ts:     Default.\n                   MultiStateAligner9PacBio:\
  \  Use for PacBio reads, or for\n                   Illumina reads mapped to PacBio/Nanopore\
  \ reads.\n\nSam-filtering parameters:\nminpos=         Ignore alignments not overlapping\
  \ this range.\nmaxpos=         Ignore alignments not overlapping this range.\nminreadmapq=4\
  \   Ignore alignments with lower mapq.\ncontigs=        Comma-delimited list of\
  \ contig names to include. These \n                should have no spaces, or underscores\
  \ instead of spaces.\nsecondary=f     Include secondary alignments.\nsupplimentary=f\
  \ Include supplimentary alignments.\nduplicate=f     Include reads flagged as duplicates.\n\
  invert=f        Invert sam filters.\n\nVariant-Calling Cutoffs:\nminreads=2    \
  \          (minad) Ignore variants seen in fewer reads.\nmaxreads=BIG          \
  \  (maxad) Ignore variants seen in more reads.\nmincov=0                Ignore variants\
  \ in lower-coverage locations.\nmaxcov=BIG              Ignore variants in higher-coverage\
  \ locations.\nminqualitymax=15        Ignore variants with lower max base quality.\n\
  minedistmax=20          Ignore variants with lower max distance from read ends.\n\
  minmapqmax=0            Ignore variants with lower max mapq.\nminidmax=0       \
  \       Ignore variants with lower max read identity.\nminpairingrate=0.1      Ignore\
  \ variants with lower pairing rate.\nminstrandratio=0.1      Ignore variants with\
  \ lower plus/minus strand ratio.\nminquality=12.0         Ignore variants with lower\
  \ average base quality.\nminedist=10.0           Ignore variants with lower average\
  \ distance from ends.\nminavgmapq=0.0          Ignore variants with lower average\
  \ mapq.\nminallelefraction=0.1   Ignore variants with lower allele fraction.  This\n\
  \                        should be adjusted for high ploidies.\nminid=0        \
  \         Ignore variants with lower average read identity.\nminscore=20.0     \
  \      Ignore variants with lower Phred-scaled score.\nclearfilters            Clear\
  \ all filters.  Filter flags placed after\n                        the clearfilters\
  \ flag will still be applied.\n\nThere are additionally max filters for score, quality,\
  \ mapq, allelefraction,\nand identity.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This\
  \ will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g\
  \ will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs.\
  \ The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause\
