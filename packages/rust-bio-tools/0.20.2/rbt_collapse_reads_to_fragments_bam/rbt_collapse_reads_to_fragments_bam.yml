help_text: "rbt-collapse-reads-to-fragments-bam 0.20.2\nFelix MÃ¶lder <felix.moelder@uni-due.de>\n\
  Tool to merge sets of PCR duplicate reads from a BAM file into one maximum likelihood\
  \ fragment sequence each with\naccordingly improved base quality scores.\n\nTakes\
  \ a BAM file and returns a BAM file in which all PCR duplicates have been merged\
  \ into a consensus read. Duplicates\nmust be marked by Picard Tools using the TAG_DUPLICATE_SET_MEMBERS\
  \ option.\n\nAssumptions: - Reads are of equal length - Reads are marked by Picard\
  \ Tools\n\nUSAGE:\n    rbt collapse-reads-to-fragments bam [FLAGS] <bam> <consensus-fq1>\
  \ <consensus-fq2> <consensus-fq-se> <skipped-bam>\n\nFLAGS:\n    -h, --help    \

  \    \n            Add list of reads that were merged for each consensus read. Note\
  \ that this can yield very long FASTQ name\n            lines which cannot be handled\
  \ by some tools.\n\nARGS:\n    <bam>                \n            Input BAM file\
  \ with marked duplicates\n\n    <consensus-fq1>      \n            Output FASTQ\
  \ file with forward reads\n\n    <consensus-fq2>      \n            Output FASTQ\
  \ file with reverse reads\n\n    <consensus-fq-se>    \n            Output FASTQ\
  \ file for overlapping consensus reads.\n\n    <skipped-bam>        \n         \
