help_text: "closest-features\n  citation: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/14/1919.abstract\n\
  \            https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts277\n  version:  2.4.39 (typical)\n\
  \  authors:  Shane Neph & Scott Kuehn\n\nUSAGE: closest-features [Process-Flags]\
  \ <input-file> <query-file>\n   All input files must be sorted per sort-bed.\n \
  \  The program accepts BED and Starch file formats\n   May use '-' for a file to\
  \ indicate reading from standard input (BED format only).\n\n   For every element\
  \ in <input-file>, determine the two elements from <query-file> falling\n     nearest\
  \ to its left and right edges (See NOTES below).  By default, echo the <input-file>\n\
  \     element, followed by those left and right elements found in <query-file>.\n\
  \n  Process Flags:\n    --chrom <chromosome>   Jump to and process data for given\
  \ <chromosome> only.\n    --closest              Choose the closest element for\
  \ output only.  Ties go the left element.\n    --delim <delim>        Change output\
  \ delimiter from '|' to <delim> between columns (e.g. '\\t')\n    --dist       \
  \          Print the signed distances to the <input-file> element as additional\n\
  \                             columns of output.  An overlapping element has a distance\
  \ of 0.\n    --ec                   Error check all input files (slower).\n    --header\
  \               Accept headers (VCF, GFF, SAM, BED, WIG) in any input file.\n  \
  \  --help                 Print this message and exit successfully.\n    --no-overlaps\
  \          Overlapping elements from <query-file> will not be reported.\n    --no-ref\
  \               Do not echo elements from <input-file>.\n    --version         \
  \     Print program information.\n\n  NOTES:\n    If an element from <query-file>\
  \ overlaps the <input-file> element, its distance is zero.\n      An overlapping\
  \ element takes precedence over all non-overlapping elements.  This is true\n  \
  \    even when the overlapping element's edge-to-edge distance to the <input-file>'s\
  \ element\n      is greater than the edge-to-edge distance from a non-overlapping\
  \ element.\n    Overlapping elements may be ignored completely (no precedence) with\
  \ --no-overlaps.\n    Elements reported as closest to the left and right edges are\
  \ never the same.\n    When no qualifying element from <query-file> exists as a\
  \ closest feature, 'NA' is reported.\n\n"
