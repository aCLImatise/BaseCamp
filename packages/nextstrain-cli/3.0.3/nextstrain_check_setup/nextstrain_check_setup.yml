  \ are supported, each of which will be tested:\n\n  • Our Docker image is the preferred\
  \ build environment.  Docker itself must\n    be installed and configured on your\
  \ computer first, but once it is, the\n    build environment is robust and reproducible.\n\
  \n  • Your native ambient environment will be tested for snakemake, augur, and\n\
  \    auspice. Their presence implies a working build environment, but does not\n\
  \    guarantee it.\n\n  • Remote jobs on AWS Batch.  Your AWS account, if credentials\
  \ are available\n    in your environment or via aws-cli configuration, will be tested\
  \ for the\n    presence of appropriate resources.  Their presence implies a working\
  \ AWS\n    Batch environment, but does not guarantee it.\n\noptional arguments:\n\
