  Version: 1.0.15; Built: Mon Mar  8 18:59:11 UTC 2021 by root\n\nUsage: \nbam <tool>\
  \ [<tool arguments>]\nbam (usage|help) - Will print usage and exit.\nbam (usage|help)\
  \ <tool> - Will print usage for specific tool and exit.\n\nTools to Rewrite SAM/BAM\
  \ Files: \n convert - Convert SAM/BAM to SAM/BAM\n writeRegion - Write a file with\
  \ reads in the specified region and/or have the specified read name\n splitChromosome\
  \ - Split BAM by Chromosome\n splitBam - Split a BAM file into multiple BAM files\
  \ based on ReadGroup\n findCigars - Output just the reads that contain any of the\
  \ specified CIGAR operations.\n\nTools to Modify & write SAM/BAM Files: \n clipOverlap\
  \ - Clip overlapping read pairs in a SAM/BAM File already sorted by Coordinate or\
  \ ReadName\n filter - Filter reads by clipping ends with too high of a mismatch\
  \ percentage and by marking reads unmapped if the quality of mismatches is too high\n\
  \ revert - Revert SAM/BAM replacing the specified fields with their previous values\
  \ (if known) and removes specified tags\n squeeze -  reduces files size by dropping\
  \ OQ fields, duplicates, & specified tags, using '=' when a base matches the reference,\
  \ binning quality scores, and replacing readNames with unique integers\n trimBam\
  \ - Trim the ends of reads in a SAM/BAM file changing read ends to 'N' and quality\
  \ to '!' or softclipping the ends (resulting file will not be sorted)\n mergeBam\
  \ - merge multiple BAMs and headers appending ReadGroupIDs if necessary\n polishBam\
  \ - adds/updates header lines & adds the RG tag to each record\n dedup - Mark Duplicates\n\
  \ dedup_LowMem - Mark Duplicates using only a little memory\n recab - Recalibrate\n\
  \nInformational Tools\n validate - Validate a SAM/BAM File\n diff - Diff 2 coordinate\
  \ sorted SAM/BAM files.\n stats - Stats a SAM/BAM File\n gapInfo - Print information\
  \ on the gap between read pairs in a SAM/BAM File.\n\nTools to Print Information\
  \ In Readable Format\n dumpHeader - Print SAM/BAM Header\n dumpRefInfo - Print SAM/BAM\
  \ Reference Name Information\n dumpIndex - Print BAM Index File in English\n readReference\
  \ - Print the reference string for the specified region\n explainFlags - Describe\
  \ flags\n\nAdditional Tools\n bam2FastQ - Convert the specified BAM file to fastQs.\n\
  \nDummy/Example Tools\n readIndexedBam - Read Indexed BAM By Reference and write\
  \ it from reference id -1 to maxRefId\n"
