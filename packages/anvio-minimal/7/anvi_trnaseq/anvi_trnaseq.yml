  \ INT\n                        The anvi'o sequence aligner manages memory consumption\n\
  \                        by chunking the list of alignment targets, so that\n  \
  \                      queries are aligned to the first chunk of targets,\n    \
  \                    then the second chunk, and so on. This parameter sets\n   \
  \                     the maximum number of target sequences in each chunk\n   \
  \                     (by default 20000). Memory management becomes\n          \
  \              important when aligning short queries to a large\n              \
  \          number of targets, which involves searching queries\n               \
  \         against a massive number of k-mers (equal in length to\n             \
  \           the shortest query) that have been extracted from\n                \
  \        targets. Adjust this parameter downward if your system\n              \
  \          runs out of memory during alignment; adjust this\n                  \
  \      parameter upward to speed up alignment if you find\n                    \
  \    that you are not memory-limited. Ideally, we would set\n                  \

  \ queries are chunked and run\n                        as separate alignment tasks.\
  \ Queries are chunked based\n                        on sequence length, as longer\
  \ k-mers can be used with\n                        longer queries to speed up mapping.\
  \ This parameter\n                        sets the sequence length interval used\
  \ to chunk\n                        queries. For a standard tRNA-seq dataset with\
  \ --min-\n                        trna-fragment-size set to the default of 25 and\
  \ a\n                        maximum unprofiled query length of, say, 170, the\n\
  \                        default length interval of 20 would result in 8\n     \
  \                   chunks. Adjust this parameter downward if your system\n    \
