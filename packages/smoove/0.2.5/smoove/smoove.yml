help_text: "smoove version: 0.2.5\n\nsmoove calls several programs. Those with 'Y'\
  \ are found on your $PATH. Only those with '*' are required.\n\n *[Y] bgzip [ sort\
  \   -> (compress) ->   index ]\n *[Y] gsort [(sort)  ->  compress   ->  index ]\n\
  \ *[Y] tabix [ sort   ->  compress   -> (index)]\n *[Y] lumpy\n *[Y] lumpy_filter\n\
  \ *[Y] samtools\n *[Y] svtyper\n *[Y] mosdepth [extra filtering of split and discordant\
  \ files for better scaling]\n\n  [Y] duphold [(optional) annotate calls with depth\
  \ changes]\n  [Y] svtools [only needed for large cohorts].\n\nAvailable sub-commands\
  \ are below. Each can be run with -h for additional help.\n\ncall        : call\
  \ lumpy (and optionally svtyper)\nmerge       : merge and sort (using svtools) calls\
  \ from multiple samples\ngenotype    : parallelize svtyper on an input VCF\npaste\
  \       : square final calls from multiple samples (each with same number of variants)\n\
  plot-counts : plot counts of split, discordant reads before, after smoove filtering\n\
  annotate    : annotate a VCF with gene and quality of SV call\nhipstr      : run\
  \ hipSTR in parallel\ncnvnator    : run cnvnator in parallel\nduphold     : run\
  \ duphold in parallel (this can be done by adding a flag to call or genotype)\n"
