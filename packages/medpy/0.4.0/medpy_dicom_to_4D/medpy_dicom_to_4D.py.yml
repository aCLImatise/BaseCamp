  \ offset\n\n                  Takes a dicom folder, loads the contained slices and\
  \ saves them as a proper 4D volume.\n                  The supplied target dimension\
  \ parameter determines the dimension along which to split the\n                \
  \  original image and the consecutive slices parameter determines the offset after\
  \ which to\n                  split.\n                \n                  A typical\
  \ use-case are DICOM images, which often come with the temporal and third spatial\n\
  \                  dimension stacked on top of each other.\n                  Let\
  \ us assume a (5000, 200, 190) 3D image. In reality this file contains a number\
  \ of 50\n                  volume of 100x200x190, which each represent a point in\
  \ time. More concretely, always 50\n                  slices of the first dimension\
  \ show the transformation of a 2D image in time. Then occurs\n                 \
  \ a visible jump, when the view changes in space from the 50th to the 51th slice.\
  \ The\n                  following 50 slices are the temporal transformation of\
  \ this new spatial slice and then\n                  occur another jump, and so\
  \ on. \n                \n                  Calling this script with a target dimension\
  \ of 0 (meaning the first dimension of the\n                  image containing the\
  \ 5000 slices) and a consecutive slices parameter of 50 (which is used\n       \
  \           to tell how many consecutive slices belong together), will result in\
  \ a 4D image of the\n                  shape (100, 50, 200, 190) containing the\
  \ spatial volumes separated by an additional time\n                  dimension.\n\
