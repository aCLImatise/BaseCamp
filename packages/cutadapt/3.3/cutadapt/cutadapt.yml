  \          like 'length=123'.\n  --strip-suffix STRIP_SUFFIX\n                 \
  \       Remove this suffix from read names if present. Can be\n                \
  \        given multiple times.\n  -x PREFIX, --prefix PREFIX\n                 \
  \       Add this prefix to read names. Use {name} to insert the\n              \
  \          name of the matching adapter.\n  -y SUFFIX, --suffix SUFFIX\n       \
  \                 Add this suffix to read names; can also include {name}\n  --rename\
  \ TEMPLATE     Rename reads using TEMPLATE containing variables such as\n      \
  \                  {id}, {adapter_name} etc. (see documentation)\n  --zero-cap,\
  \ -z        Change negative quality values to zero.\n\nFiltering of processed reads:\n\
  \  Filters are applied after above read modifications. Paired-end reads are\n  always\
  \ discarded pairwise (see also --pair-filter).\n\n  -m LEN[:LEN2], --minimum-length\
  \ LEN[:LEN2]\n                        Discard reads shorter than LEN. Default: 0\n\
  \  -M LEN[:LEN2], --maximum-length LEN[:LEN2]\n                        Discard reads\
  \ longer than LEN. Default: no limit\n  --max-n COUNT         Discard reads with\
  \ more than COUNT 'N' bases. If COUNT\n                        is a number between\
  \ 0 and 1, it is interpreted as a\n                        fraction of the read\
  \ length.\n  --max-expected-errors ERRORS, --max-ee ERRORS\n                   \
  \     Discard reads whose expected number of errors (computed\n                \
  \        from quality values) exceeds ERRORS.\n  --discard-trimmed, --discard\n\
  \                        Discard reads that contain an adapter. Use also -O to\n\
  \                        avoid discarding too many randomly matching reads.\n  --discard-untrimmed,\
  \ --trimmed-only\n                        Discard reads that do not contain an adapter.\n\
  \  --discard-casava      Discard reads that did not pass CASAVA filtering (header\n\
  \                        has :Y:).\n\nOutput:\n  --quiet               Print only\
  \ error messages.\n  --report {full,minimal}\n                        Which type\
  \ of report to print: 'full' or 'minimal'.\n                        Default: full\n\
  \  -o FILE, --output FILE\n                        Write trimmed reads to FILE.\
  \ FASTQ or FASTA format is\n                        chosen depending on input. Summary\
  \ report is sent to\n                        standard output. Use '{name}' for demultiplexing\
  \ (see\n                        docs). Default: write to standard output\n  --fasta\
  \               Output FASTA to standard output even on FASTQ input.\n  -Z     \
  \               Use compression level 1 for gzipped output files\n             \
  \           (faster, but uses more space)\n  --info-file FILE      Write information\
  \ about each read and its adapter\n                        matches into FILE. See\
  \ the documentation for the file\n                        format.\n  -r FILE, --rest-file\
  \ FILE\n                        When the adapter matches in the middle of a read,\
  \ write\n                        the rest (after the adapter) to FILE.\n  --wildcard-file\
  \ FILE  When the adapter has N wildcard bases, write adapter\n                 \
  \       bases matching wildcard positions to FILE. (Inaccurate\n               \
  \         with indels.)\n  --too-short-output FILE\n                        Write\
  \ reads that are too short (according to length\n                        specified\
  \ by -m) to FILE. Default: discard reads\n  --too-long-output FILE\n           \
  \             Write reads that are too long (according to length\n             \
  \           specified by -M) to FILE. Default: discard reads\n  --untrimmed-output\
  \ FILE\n                        Write reads that do not contain any adapter to FILE.\n\
  \                        Default: output to same file as trimmed reads\n\nPaired-end\
  \ options:\n  The -A/-G/-B/-U options work like their -a/-b/-g/-u counterparts,\

  \  3' adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.\n  -G ADAPTER          \

  \  5'/3 adapter to be removed from second read in a pair.\n  -U LENGTH         \
  \    Remove LENGTH bases from second read in a pair.\n  -p FILE, --paired-output\
  \ FILE\n                        Write second read in a pair to FILE.\n  --pair-adapters\
  \       Treat adapters given with -a/-A etc. as pairs. Either\n                \
  \        both or none are removed from each read pair.\n  --pair-filter (any|both|first)\n\

  \                       filtered. Default: any\n  --interleaved         Read and/or\
  \ write interleaved paired-end reads.\n  --untrimmed-paired-output FILE\n      \
  \                  Write second read in a pair to this FILE when no adapter\n  \
  \                      was found. Use with --untrimmed-output. Default: output\n\
