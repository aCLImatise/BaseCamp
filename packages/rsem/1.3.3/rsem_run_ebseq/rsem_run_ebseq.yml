  \nDESCRIPTION\n    This program is a wrapper over EBSeq. It performs differential\n\
  \    expression analysis and can work on two or more conditions. All\n    genes/transcripts\
  \ and their associated statistcs are reported in one\n    output file. This program\
  \ does not control false discovery rate and call\n    differential expressed genes/transcripts.\
  \ Please use 'rsem-control-fdr'\n    to control false discovery rate after this\
  \ program is finished.\n\nOUTPUT\n    output_file\n        This file reports the\
  \ calculated statistics for all\n        genes/transcripts. It is written as a matrix\
  \ with row and column\n        names. The row names are the genes'/transcripts'\
  \ names. The column\n        names are for the reported statistics.\n\n        If\
  \ there are only 2 different conditions among the samples, four\n        statistics\
  \ (columns) will be reported for each gene/transcript. They\n        are \"PPEE\"\
  , \"PPDE\", \"PostFC\" and \"RealFC\". \"PPEE\" is the posterior\n        probability\
  \ (estimated by EBSeq) that a gene/transcript is equally\n        expressed. \"\
  PPDE\" is the posterior probability that a\n        gene/transcript is differentially\
  \ expressed. \"PostFC\" is the\n        posterior fold change (condition 1 over\
  \ condition2) for a\n        gene/transcript. It is defined as the ratio between\
  \ posterior mean\n        expression estimates of the gene/transcript for each condition.\n\
  \        \"RealFC\" is the real fold change (condition 1 over condition2) for a\n\
  \        gene/transcript. It is the ratio of the normalized within condition\n \
  \       1 mean count over normalized within condition 2 mean count for the\n   \
  \     gene/transcript. Fold changes are calculated using EBSeq's 'PostFC'\n    \
  \    function. The genes/transcripts are reported in descending order of\n     \
  \   their \"PPDE\" values.\n\n        If there are more than 2 different conditions\
  \ among the samples, the\n        output format is different. For differential expression\
  \ analysis\n        with more than 2 conditions, EBSeq will enumerate all possible\n\
  \        expression patterns (on which conditions are equally expressed and\n  \
  \      which conditions are not). Suppose there are k different patterns,\n    \
  \    the first k columns of the output file give the posterior\n        probability\
  \ of each expression pattern is true. Patterns are defined\n        in a separate\
  \ file, 'output_file.pattern'. The k+1 column gives the\n        maximum a posteriori\
  \ (MAP) expression pattern for each\n        gene/transcript. The k+2 column gives\
  \ the posterior probability that\n        not all conditions are equally expressed\
  \ (column name \"PPDE\"). The\n        genes/transcripts are reported in descending\
  \ order of their \"PPDE\"\n        column values. For details on how EBSeq works\
  \ for more than 2\n        conditions, please refer to EBSeq's manual.\n\n    output_file.normalized_data_matrix\n\
  \        This file contains the median normalized version of the input data\n  \
  \      matrix.\n\n    output_file.pattern\n        This file is only generated when\
  \ there are more than 2 conditions.\n        It defines all possible expression\
  \ patterns over the conditions\n        using a matrix with names. Each row of the\
  \ matrix refers to a\n        different expression pattern and each column gives\
  \ the expression\n        status of a different condition. Two conditions are equally\n\
  \        expressed if and only if their statuses are the same.\n\n    output_file.condmeans\n\
  \        This file is only generated when there are more than 2 conditions.\n  \
  \      It gives the normalized mean count value for each gene/transcript at\n  \
  \      each condition. It is formatted as a matrix with names. Each row\n      \
  \  represents a gene/transcript and each column represent a condition.\n       \
  \ The order of genes/transcripts is the same as 'output_file'. This\n        file\
  \ can be used to calculate fold changes between conditions which\n        users\
  \ are interested in.\n\nEXAMPLES\n    1) We're interested in isoform-level differential\
  \ expression analysis\n    and there are two conditions. Each condition has 5 replicates.\
  \ We have\n    already collected the data matrix as 'IsoMat.txt' and generated ngvector\n\
  \    as 'ngvector.ngvec':\n\n     rsem-run-ebseq --ngvector ngvector.ngvec IsoMat.txt\
  \ 5,5 IsoMat.results\n\n    The results will be in 'IsoMat.results' and\n    'IsoMat.results.normalized_data_matrix'\
  \ contains the normalized data\n    matrix.\n\n    2) We're interested in gene-level\
  \ analysis and there are 3 conditions.\n    The first condition has 3 replicates\
  \ and the other two has 4 replicates\n    each. The data matrix is named as 'GeneMat.txt':\n\
  \n     rsem-run-ebseq GeneMat.txt 3,4,4 GeneMat.results\n\n    Four files, 'GeneMat.results',\
  \ 'GeneMat.results.normalized_data_matrix',\n    'GeneMat.results.pattern', and\
  \ 'GeneMat.results.condmeans', will be\n    generated.\n\n"
