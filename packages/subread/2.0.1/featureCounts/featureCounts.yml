  \             Junctions were identified from those exon-spanning reads\n       \
  \               in the input (containing 'N' in CIGAR string). Counting\n      \
  \                results are saved to a file named '<output_file>.jcounts'\n\n \
  \ -G <string>         Provide the name of a FASTA-format file that contains the\n\
  \                      reference sequences used in read mapping that produced the\n\
  \                      provided SAM/BAM files. This optional argument can be used\n\

  \ This option is only applicable for\n                      paired-end reads; single-end\
  \ reads are always counted as\n                      reads.\n\n  -B            \
  \      Only count read pairs that have both ends aligned.\n\n  -P              \
  \    Check validity of paired-end distance when counting read \n               \

  \ mapping to same chromosome \n                      but on different strands.\n\
  \n  --donotsort         Do not sort reads in BAM/SAM input. Note that reads from\
  \ \n                      the same pair are required to be located next to each\
  \ \n                      other in the input.\n\n# Number of CPU threads\n\n  -T\
  \ <int>            Number of the threads. 1 by default.\n\n# Read groups\n\n  --byReadGroup\
  \       Assign reads by read group. \"RG\" tag is required to be\n             \

  \ reads\n\n  -L                  Count long reads such as Nanopore and PacBio reads.\
  \ Long\n                      read counting can only run in one thread and only\
  \ reads\n                      (not read-pairs) can be counted. There is no limitation\
  \ on\n                      the number of 'M' operations allowed in a CIGAR string\
  \ in\n                      long read counting.\n\n# Assignment results for each\
  \ read\n\n  -R <format>         Output detailed assignment results for each read\

  \ of the\n                      following formats: CORE, SAM and BAM. See Users\
  \ Guide for\n                      more info about these formats.\n\n  --Rpath <string>\
  \    Specify a directory to save the detailed assignment\n                     \

  \ allowed in a CIGAR\n                      string. 10 by default. Both 'X' and\
  \ '=' are treated as 'M'\n                      and adjacent 'M' operations are\
  \ merged in the CIGAR\n                      string.\n\n  --verbose           Output\
  \ verbose information for debugging, such as un-\n                      matched\
