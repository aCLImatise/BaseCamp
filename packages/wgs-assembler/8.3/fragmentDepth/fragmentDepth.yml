  \ N     use scaffolds at most N bases long.\n\nMODES:  -histogram, -scaffold or\
  \ -depth\n\nThe default mode is to compute a histogram of the number of bases at\
  \ some\ndepth of coverage.\n\nThe -scaffold mode reports the mode, mean, median\
  \ depth per scaffold.  The\n-stepSize option will compute those stats, in blocks\
  \ of N bases (e.g., for bases\n0 through N, then N through 2N, then 2N through 3N,\
  \ etc.)\n\nThe -depth mode writes a multi-fasta file with the actual depth at each\
  \ base\nencoded.  The encoding is somewhat complicated to avoid using the '>' letter.\n\
  Depth 0 through 9 is encoded as '0' through '9'.  Depth 10 through 68 is\nencoded\
  \ as A-Z[\\]^_`a-z{|}, and depth more than 68 is encoded as ~.  Decode as:\n  depth\
  \ = letter - '0';\n  if (depth > 9)\n    depth -= 7;\n\n!!WARNING -- The input frgscf\
  \ MUST be sorted by scaffold ID -- WARNING!!\n\n"
