  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_load_function_from_protein_align.pl\n\nDescription:\n   \
  \ The script takes an annotation in gff format, a protein alignment in gff\n   \
  \ format and a protein fasta file as input. It checks if protein\n    alignement\
  \ overlap gene models, and will load the gene name and/or the\n    function to the\
  \ gene model according to the user requirements. The\n    script applies the following\
  \ steps: For each gene model structure it\n    take the proteins aligned against,\
  \ and sort them by an overlaping score.\n    The best coming first. Then it filters\
  \ them by applying the overlaping\n    score threshold. 1) If you activated the\
  \ PE and the species filtering,\n    we will try to find the best protein that follows\
  \ the defined\n    requirement. 2.1) If you activated the PE filtering or the precedent\n\
  \    filtering (1) didn't succeed, we take the best protein according to the\n \
  \   PE requirement. 2.2) If you activated the species filtering or the\n    precedent\
  \ filtering (1) didn't succeed, we take the best protein\n    according to the list\
  \ of prioritized species defined. 3) If no option or\n    the precedent filtering\
  \ (1,2.1,2.2)didn't succeed, the best protein will\n    be selected. You can flip\
  \ the 2.1 and 2.2 test using the priority\n    option.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_load_function_from_protein_align.pl\
