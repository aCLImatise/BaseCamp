  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_fix_longest_ORF.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script aims to\
  \ fix the ORFs of gene models described in the gff\n    file. By fixing it means\
  \ replacing the original ORF (defined by the cds)\n    when the longest predicted\
  \ one within the mRNA is different. See the\n    --model parameter for more details\
  \ about the different cases. Currently\n    the tool does not perform incomplete\
  \ prediction (It always look for a\n    start codon). It is consequently advised\
  \ to not use the model5 except if\n    you understand what you do. Several ouput\
  \ files will be written if you\n    specify an output. One will contain the gene\
  \ not modified (intact), one\n    with the gene models fixed (modified), one will\
  \ both together (all).\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_fix_longest_ORF.pl -gff infile.gff\
