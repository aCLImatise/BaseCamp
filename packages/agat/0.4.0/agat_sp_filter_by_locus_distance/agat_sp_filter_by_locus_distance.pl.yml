  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_filter_by_locus_distance.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ aims to remove or flag loci that are too close to each other.\n    Close loci\
  \ are important to remove when training abinitio tools in order\n    to train intergenic\
  \ region properly. Indeed if intergenic region\n    (surrouneded part of a locus)\
  \ contain part of another locus, the\n    training on intergenic part will be biased.\n\

  \ write only\n            one and add the flag <low_dist> in the gff.(tag = Lvalue\
