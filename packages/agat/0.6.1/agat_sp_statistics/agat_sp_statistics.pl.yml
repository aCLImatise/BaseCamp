  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_statistics.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script provides exhaustive\
  \ statitics of a gft/gff file. /!\\ If you\n    have isoforms in your file, even\
  \ if correct, some values calculated\n    might sounds incoherent: e.g total length\
  \ mRNA can be superior than the\n    genome size. Because all isoforms lengh are\
  \ aditionned... It is why by\n    deafault we always compute the statistics twice\
  \ when there are isoforms,\n    once with the isoforms, once wihtout (In that case\
  \ we keep the longest\n    isoform per locus).\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_statistics.pl\

  \ of distribution of the\n            features will be printed in pdf files. (d\
