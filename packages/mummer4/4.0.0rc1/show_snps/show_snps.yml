  \ on the command line.\n  Output is to stdout, and consists of a list of SNPs (or\
  \ amino acid\nsubstitutions for promer) with positions and other useful info.\n\
  Output will be sorted with -r by default and the [BUFF] column will\nalways refer\
  \ to the sequence whose positions have been sorted. This\nvalue specifies the distance\
  \ from this SNP to the nearest mismatch\n(end of alignment, indel, SNP, etc) in\
  \ the same alignment, while the\n[DIST] column specifies the distance from this\
  \ SNP to the nearest\nsequence end. SNPs for which the [R] and [Q] columns are greater\
  \ than\n0 should be evaluated with caution, as these columns specify the\nnumber\
  \ of other alignments which overlap this position. Use -C to\nassure SNPs are only\
  \ reported from unique alignment regions.\n\n"
