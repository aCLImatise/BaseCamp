  \                      -l <seq_len_list> [OPTIONS] \n\nDESCRIPTION:\nCompares predicted\
  \ genes with \"real\" (or annotated) genes.\nReports standard measures of prediction\
  \ quality.  The following\nmeasures are reported:\n\n    - nucleotide sensitivity\
  \ (Sn)\n    - nucleotide specificity (Sp)\n    - approximate correlation (AC)\n\
  \    - correlation coefficient (CC)\n    - exon sensitivity (ESn)\n    - exon specificity\
  \ (ESp)\n    - proportion of real exons correctly predicted (CRa)\n    - proportion\
  \ of real exons partially predicted (PCa)\n    - proportion of real exons with overlapping\
  \ predictions (OLa)\n    - missed exons (ME)\n    - proportion of predicted exons\
  \ that are correct (CRp)\n    - proportion of predicted exons that are partially\
  \ correct (PCp)\n    - proportion of predicted exons that overlap real ones (OLp)\n\
  \    - wrong exons (WE)\n\nAll quantities are computed as described in \"Evaluation\
  \ of Gene-Finding\nPrograms on Mammalian Sequences,\" by Rogic et al. (Genome Research\n\
  11:817-832).  Note that CRa + PCa + OLa + ME = 1 and CRp + PCp + OLp +\nWE = 1.\
  \  Note also that each set (predicted and real) should consist of\nnon-overlapping\
  \ groups of features (see 'refeature').\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -r <real_fname_list> \n\
  \        (required) List of names of files defining real genes (GFF). \n\n    -p\
  \ <pred_fname_list> \n        (required) List of names of files defining predicted\
  \ genes\n        (GFF).  Must correspond in order to <real_fname_list>.\n\n    -l\
  \ <seq_len_list>\n        (required) List of lengths of sequences.  Needed to compute\n\
  \        certain nucleotide-level statistics.\n\n    -f <feat_list>  \n        List\
  \ of names of all features denoting exon regions.  By\n        default, equal to\
  \ the single name \"CDS\".\n\n    -d <fname_prefix>  \n        Dump full coords\
  \ of correct, partially correct, wrong, missed, \n        and overlapping exons\
  \ to a set of files having the specified \n        file name prefix.\n\n    -n <nbases>\n\
  \        Also report stats on \"nearly correct\" exons, that is, incorrect\n   \
  \     exons whose boundaries are within <nbases> of being correct.\n        Columns\
  \ will be labeled \"NCa\" and \"NCp\".\n\n    -h\n        Print this help message.\n\
  \n\nNOTE: be sure stop codons are included in CDSs in both the predicted\nand real\
  \ sets, or in neither set.\n\n"
