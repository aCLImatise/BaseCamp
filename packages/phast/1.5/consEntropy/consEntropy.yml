help_text: "\nPROGRAM: consEntropy\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n    For use with phastCons.  Given\
  \ phylogenetic models for conserved and\n    non-conserved states, the target coverage,\
  \ and the (prior) expected\n    length of a conserved element, compute the relative\
  \ entropy (H) of the\n    phylogenetic models, the expected minimum number of conserved\
  \ sites\n    required to predict conserved element (L_min), the \"phylogenetic\n\
  \    information threshold\" (PIT = L_min * H), and the expected maximum\n    number\
  \ of nonconserved sites tolerated within a conserved element\n    (L_max).  Also\
  \ will make a recommendation for a new prior expected\n    length based on a given\
  \ target value of L_min*H (see --LminH).\n\nUSAGE: consEntropy [OPTIONS] <target-coverage>\
  \ <expected-length> \\\n            [ <cons.mod> <noncons.mod> ]\n\nOPTIONS:\n \
  \   --H, -H <value>\n        Instead of computing the relative entropy from two\
  \ .mod files,\n        just use the specified value.  The .mod files aren't required\n\
  \        in this case.\n\n    --LminH, -L <value> [or --NH/-N, for backward compatibility]\n\
  \        Report the expected length that would produce the specified value\n   \
  \     of L_min * H (i.e., the specified PIT), assuming H remains constant\n    \
  \    (it generally won't).  Can be used iteratively to converge on a\n        desired\
  \ PIT.\n\n    --help, -h\n        Print this help message.\n\nNOTE:\n    The relative\
  \ entropy is currently computed by brute force, i.e.,\n    by enumerating all possible\
  \ labelings of the leaves of the tree.\n    This approach won't be feasible with\
  \ large trees.\n"
