help_text: "\nPROGRAM:      phastMotif\n\nDESCRIPTION:  Predicts motifs from a set\
  \ of multiple alignments.  Uses\n              an EM algorithm similar to that of\
  \ MEME, but a motif is\n              defined by phylogenetic models rather than\
  \ multinomial\n              distributions.  The specified multiple alignments may\n\
  \              actually be single sequences (see -m).  Various parameters\n    \
  \          control the strategy for initialization (see below).\n              Currently,\
  \ the F81 substitution model is assumed.\n\nUSAGE:        phastMotif [-t <treefile>]\
  \ [OPTIONS] <msa_list>\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -t <file> (Required unless -m or -p) Use\
  \ specified tree topology for\n              all phylogenetic models (Newick format).\n\
  \n    -i <fmt>  Input format for alignment.  May be FASTA, PHYLIP, MPM, SS,\n  \
  \            or MAF (default FASTA).\n\n    -b <file> Read background model from\

  \ is estimated\n              in a preprocessing step, by pooling all data.\n\n\

  \ size (default is 10).\n\n    -B <n>    Report best <n> motifs (default 3).\n\n\
  \    -m        MEME mode.  Use multinomial rather than phylogenetic\n          \
  \    models.  Causes multiple alignments to be ignored -- any\n              gaps\

  \ negative\n              examples.  Can be used with or without -m.\n\n    -p \
  \       Use \"profile\" models rather than phylogenetic models\n              (characters\

  \ is a hybrid of the\n              full model and MEME's model.  Essentially, it\
  \ uses the\n              multiple alignments but not the phylogeny.  NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.\n\
  \n    -n <n>    Perform <n> random restarts and report the motif with highest\n\
  \              likelihood.  Default number is 10.  Ignored with -I, -P, and\n  \
  \            -R unless -S is specified (see below).\n\n    -I <mlst> Run the algorithm\

  \              bases.  Each string must have length at most equal to\n         \
  \     the size of the motif.  If shorter, it is used as a\n              \"seed\"\
