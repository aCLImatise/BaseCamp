  \ [OPTIONS] alignment tree.mod > out.gff\n\nDESCRIPTION: \n\n    Attempts to identify\
  \ elements under selection in all species or in\n    some subset of species, based\
  \ on a multiple alignment and a\n    phylo-HMM.  In particular, detects elements\
  \ that have been under\n    selection since the divergence of all species in the\
  \ given set,\n    that were \"born\" on some branch of the tree since their divergence\n\
  \    and have been under selection since, or that were present in the\n    common\
  \ ancestor but \"died\" (ceased to be under selection) on some\n    branch of the\
  \ tree.  Currently only detects negative selection,\n    but extensions to detect\
  \ positive selection as well are planned.\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n    --rho,\
  \ -R <rho>\n        (default 0.3)\n\n    --transitions, -t [~]<mu>,<nu> \n     \
  \   Set the transition probabilities of the two-state HMM using\n        the specified\
  \ values of <mu> and <nu> (both between 0 and 1).\n\n    --phi, -p [~]<phi>\n  \
  \      (default 0.5)\n\n    --target-coverage, -C [~]<gamma>\n        (Alternative\

  \ such that the expected fraction of\n        sites in conserved elements is <gamma>\
  \ (betwen 0 and 1).  This\n        is a *prior* rather than *posterior* expectation\
  \ and assumes\n        stationarity of the state-transition process.  This option\n\

  \n    --expected-length, -E [~]<omega>\n        (Alternative to --transitions, use\

  \        Use coordinate frame of specified sequence in output.  Default\n      \
  \  value is 1, first sequence in alignment; 0 indicates\n        coordinate frame\
  \ of entire multiple alignment.\n\n    --seqname, -N <name>\n        Use specified\
  \ string for 'seqname' (GFF) or 'chrom' field in\n        output file.  Default\
  \ is obtained from input file name (double\n        filename root, e.g., \"chr22\"\
