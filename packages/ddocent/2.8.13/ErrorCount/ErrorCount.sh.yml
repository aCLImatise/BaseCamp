help_text: "This script counts the number of potential genotyping errors due to low\
  \ read depth\nIt report a low range, based on a 50% binomial probability of observing\
  \ the second allele in a heterozygote and a high range based on a 25% probability.\n\
  Potential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 1 read range from 144.0 to\
  \ 216.0\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 2 reads range from\
  \ 72.0 to 162.0\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 3 reads range\
  \ from 36.0 to 120.96\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 4 reads\
  \ range from 9.0 to 45.504\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only\
  \ 5 reads range from 4.5 to 34\n-9 number of individuals and 0 equals 0 total genotypes\n\
  Total genotypes not counting missing data -72\nTotal potential error rate is between\
  \ -3.6875 and -8.03422222222222\nSCORCHED EARTH SCENARIO\nWHAT IF ALL LOW DEPTH\
