help_text: "This script counts the number of potential genotyping errors due to low\
  \ read depth\nIt report a low range, based on a 50% binomial probability of observing\
  \ the second allele in a heterozygote and a high range based on a 25% probability.\n\
  Potential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 1 read range from 152.0 to\
  \ 228.0\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 2 reads range from\
  \ 76.0 to 171.0\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from only 3 reads range\
  \ from 38.0 to 127.67999999999999\nPotential genotyping errors from genotypes from\
  \ only 4 reads range from 9.5 to 48.032000000000004\nPotential genotyping errors\
