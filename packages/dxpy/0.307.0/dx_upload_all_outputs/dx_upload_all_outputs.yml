  \ subdirectories in the directory $HOME/out, as described\nbelow. It also adds relevant\
  \ entries into the job_output.json file.\n\nBy convention, only directories with\
  \ names equal to output parameter names are\nexpected to be found in the output\
  \ directory, and any file(s) found in those\nsubdirectories will be uploaded as\
  \ the corresponding outputs.  For example, a\nfile with the path\n\n    $HOME/out/FOO/OUTPUT.TXT\n\
  \nwill be uploaded, and the key \"FOO\" will be added to the job_output.json file\n\
  with value\n\n    {\"$dnanexus_link\": \"file-xxxx\"}\n\nwhere \"file-xxxx\" is\
  \ the ID of the newly uploaded file. If multiple files are\nfound, they will be\
  \ added as an array output (in unspecified order). If\nsubdirectories are found\
  \ under $HOME/out/FOO, then they are uploaded in their\nentirety to the workspace,\
  \ and values are added to FOO in the job_output.json\nfile. For example, the path:\n\
  \n    $HOME/out/FOO/BAR/XXX.TXT\n\nwill be uploaded to /BAR/XXX.TXT.\n\noptional\
