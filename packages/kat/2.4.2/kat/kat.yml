help_text: "The K-mer Analysis Toolkit (KAT) contains a number of tools that analyse\
  \ jellyfish K-mer hashes. \n\nThe First argument should be the tool/mode you wish\
  \ to use:\n\n   * hist:   Create an histogram of k-mer occurrences from a sequence\
  \ file.  Similar to\n             jellyfish histogram sub command but adds metadata\
  \ in output for easy plotting,\n             also actually runs multi-threaded.\n\
  \   * gcp:    K-mer GC Processor.  Creates a matrix of the number of K-mers found\
  \ given a GC\n             count and a K-mer count.\n   * comp:   K-mer comparison\
  \ tool.  Creates a matrix of shared K-mers between two (or three)\n            \
  \ sequence files.\n   * sect:   SEquence Coverage estimator Tool.  Estimates the\
  \ coverage of each sequence in\n             a file using K-mers from another sequence\
  \ file.\n   * cold:   Given, reads and an assembly, calculates both the read and\
  \ assembly K-mer\n             coverage along with GC% for each sequence in the\
  \ assembly.\n             a file using K-mers from another sequence file.\n   *\
  \ filter: Filtering tools.  Contains tools for filtering k-mers and sequences based\
  \ on\n             user-defined GC and coverage limits.\n   * plot:   Plotting tools.\
  \  Contains several plotting tools to visualise K-mer and compare\n            \
  \ distributions.\n\nOptions:\n  -v [ --verbose ]      Print extra information\n\
  \  --version             Print version string\n  --help                Produce help\
  \ message\n\n"
