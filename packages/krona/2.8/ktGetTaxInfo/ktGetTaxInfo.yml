help_text: "\nDescription:\n\n   Retrieves taxonomy information for accessions or\
  \ taxonomy IDs (as arguments\n   or the first field of <stdin>, separated by whitespace).\
  \ If the input is a\n   number, it is assumed to be a taxonomy ID; otherwise it\
  \ will be considered an\n   accession or sequence ID containing an accession in\
  \ the fourth field of pipe\n   notation (e.g. \"gi|12345|xx|ABC123.1|\", ignoring\
  \ fasta/fastq tag markers\n   [>,@]). If taxonomy information was not found for\
  \ a given input line, the\n   output line will be only the taxonomy ID, which will\
  \ be 0 if it was\n   looked up from an accession but not found.\n   \n   Output\
  \ fields are:\n   taxID  depth  parent  rank  name\n\nUsage:\n\n   ktGetTaxInfo\
  \ [IDs ...] [< ID_list] > tax_info\n\n   Command line example:\n\n      ktGetTaxInfo\
  \ A00001.1 \"gi|2|emb|A00002.1|\" 9606\n\n   Fasta tag example:\n\n      grep \"\
  >\" sequence.fasta | ktGetTaxInfo\n\nOptions:\n\n   [-p]            Prepend tax\
  \ info to the original lines (separated by tabs).\n  \n   [-a]            Append\
  \ tax info to the original lines (separated by tabs).\n   \n   [-f] <integer>  Field\
  \ of accessions. [Default: '1']\n\n   [-tax <string>  Path to directory containing\
