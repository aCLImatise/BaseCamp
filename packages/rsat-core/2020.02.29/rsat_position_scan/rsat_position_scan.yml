  \n    \e[1m-matrix_format matrix_format\e[0m\n        Specify the input matrix format.\n\
  \n        \e[1mSupported matrix formats\e[0m\n\n        Since the program takes\
  \ several matrices as input, it only accepts\n        matrices in formats supporting\
  \ several matrices per file (transfac,\n        tf, tab, cluster-buster, cb, infogibbs,\
  \ meme, stamp, uniprobe).\n\n        For a description of these formats, see the\
  \ help of \e[33mconvert-matrix\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-title title\e[0m\n        Title\
  \ displayed on top of the report page.\n\n    \e[1m-top_matrices X\e[0m\n      \
  \  Only analyze the first X motifs of the input file. This options is\n        convenient\
  \ for quick testing before starting the full analysis.\n\n    \e[1m-skip_matrices\
  \ X\e[0m\n        Skip the first X motifs of the input file. This options is\n \
  \       convenient for testing the program on a subset of the motifs before\n  \
  \      starting the full analysis.\n\n    \e[1m-top_sequences X\e[0m\n        Only\
  \ analyze the first X sequences of the input sequence file.\n\n    \e[1m-skip_sequences\
  \ X\e[0m\n        Skip the first X sequences of the input sequence file.\n\n   \
  \ \e[1m-bin bin_length\e[0m\n        The length of the bin (in bp).\n\n        Default:\
  \ 50\n\n    \e[1m-pval p_value\e[0m\n        Select only those matches with a p-value\
  \ equal or lower than the\n        specified.\n\n        Default: 1e-3\n\n    \e\
  [1m-legend_pos legend_position\e[0m\n        The place where the legend will be\
  \ inserted in the profile plot.\n\n        Default: bottom\n\n        Supported:\
  \ bottom,side\n\n    \e[1m-heatmap_dendogram\e[0m\n        Indicate if the dendogram\
  \ in the profiles heatmap should be visible\n        or not.\n\n        Default:\
  \ show\n\n        Supported: show,hide\n\n    \e[1m-bgfile background_file\e[0m\n\
  \        A file containing the background model used to scan the sequences.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-bg_format background_file\e[0m\n        Format for the background model\
  \ file.\n\n                Supported formats: all the input formats supported by\n\
  \                I<convert-background-model>.\n\n    \e[1m-bginput\e[0m\n      \
  \  Calculate background model from the input sequence set.\n\n    \e[1m-markov\e\
  [0m\n        Order of the markov chain for the background model.\n\n        This\
  \ option is incompatible with the option -bgfile.\n\n    \e[1m-rand_motifs\e[0m\n\
  \        Scan the sequences with the randomly permuted input matrices.\n\n     \
  \   Use this option as negative control.\n\n    \e[1m-rand_seq\e[0m\n        The\
  \ input sequences are randomly permuted (thus the interdependence\n        of nucleotides\
  \ is lost).\n\n        If option -bg_file is selected, the Background model is calculated\n\
  \        from these shuffled sequences.\n\n        Use this option as negative control.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-heatmap_color_palette Color_Palette\e[0m\n        Select the color palette\
  \ used in the heatmaps (divergent scales) The\n        color palettes (and their\
  \ names) are taken from ColorBrewer2 website\n        (http://colorbrewer2.org/)\n\
  \n        Supported: Spectral,RdYlGn,RdYlBu,RdGy,RdBu,PuOr,PRGn,PiYG,BrBG\n\n  \
  \      Default: RdBu\n\n    \e[1m-heatmap_color_classes X\e[0m\n        This option\
  \ specifies in how many color classes the color palette\n        will be divided.\n\
  \n        For sequential color palettes: max 9 For diverging color palettes:\n \
  \       max 11\n\n        If the user specified a color greater than the maximum\
  \ allowed, the\n        program takes this maximum value.\n\n        For more information\
  \ see ColorBrewer2 website\n        (http://colorbrewer2.org/)\n\n    \e[1m-task\
  \ tasks\e[0m\n        Specify one or several tasks to be run. If this option is\
  \ not\n        specified, all the tasks are run.\n\n        Note that some tasks\
  \ depend on others. This option should thus be\n        used with caution, by advanced\
  \ users only.\n\n        Supported tasks: (all, scan, plots)\n\n        \e[1mall\e\
  [0m Execute all the parts of the program (default)\n\n        \e[1mscan\e[0m\n \
  \           Run the motif scaning step with \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m. Usually this\
  \ is the\n            slower step. Generate a table with the putative TFBSs of each\n\
  \            PSSMs on the input sequences.\n\n        \e[1mplots\e[0m\n        \
  \    Skip the matrix scan step (if the \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m results already\n\
  \            exists) and only executes the step where the p-values are\n       \
  \     calculated and the plots are generated.\n\n            This option is ideal\
  \ to saving time once the scaning has been\n            done.\n\n    \e[1m-diff\e\
  [0m\n        Activate the differential mode where the distribution of TFBSs in\n\
  \        the input sequences are compared relative the control sequences.\n\n  \
  \  \e[1m-o output_prefix\e[0m\n        Prefix for the output files and folders.\n\
