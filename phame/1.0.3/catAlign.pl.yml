  \ mistake.\n    To suppress this warning assign a defined value to your variables.\n\
  \    \n    To help you figure out what was undefined, perl will try to tell you\n\
  \    the name of the variable (if any) that was undefined.  In some cases\n    it\
  \ cannot do this, so it also tells you what operation you used the\n    undefined\
  \ value in.  Note, however, that perl optimizes your program\n    and the operation\
  \ displayed in the warning may not necessarily appear\n    literally in your program.\
  \  For example, \"that $foo\" is usually\n    optimized into \"that \" . $foo, and\
  \ the warning will refer to the\n    concatenation (.) operator, even though there\
  \ is no . in\n    your program.\n    \n"
