  description: With this option the first set is then called "first" and is compared
    to all others. However, the other sets are not compared to each others. In this
    case, commet outputs the reads from first set in all others and vice versa, and
    it outputs two "vector" files instead of three matrice files. File called vector_plain.csv
    (resp vector_percentage) contains for each read set i, the number (resp. percentage)
    of reads from "first" in i "/" the number (resp. percentage) of reads from i in
    ref.
