  \              Compute Psi using for a given multi-isoform gene.\n             \
  \           Expects four arguments: the first is a gene ID or set\n            \
  \            of comma-separated (no spaces) gene IDs, the second is\n          \
  \              a GFF indexed file with the gene information, the\n             \
  \           third is a sorted and indexed BAM file with reads\n                \
  \        aligned to the gene, and the fourth is an output\n                    \

  \        Runs on a set of genes from a file. Takes as input:\n                 \
  \       (1) a two-column tab-delimited file, where column 1 is\n               \

  \          MISO will run on all the events described in the file,\n            \

  \                        Compute comparison statistics between the two given\n \

  \                  output, and the third is the directory where results\n      \

  \                       sample 1 and the label for sample 2, where sample 1\n  \
  \                      and sample 2 correspond to the order of samples given\n \

  \                        Label for MISO summary file. If not given, uses\n     \
