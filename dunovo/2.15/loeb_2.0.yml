  Run the Loeb pipeline as it was published in the Kennedy et al. 2014 paper\n(release\
  \ 2.0). If -d (\"duplex\") is given, it will stop after producing the\nfinal duplex\
  \ reads (step 62). This is the default. If -c (\"cleanup\") is given,\nit will skip\
  \ producing the duplex reads, assuming it's already been done, and\njust do the\
  \ filtering, realignment, and trimming (steps 63-71). If -a (\"all\")\nis given,\
  \ it will do the whole pipeline (both halves). If it's not doing the\nsecond part,\
  \ Picard and GATK are not required. Otherwise, provide the paths to\nthe directories\
  \ containing their .jars by setting $PicardDir and $GatkDir.\nDependencies:\nPython\
  \    >= 2.7 (and < 3.0)\nBWA       <= 0.6.2\nSamtools  <= 0.1.18\nBioPython 1.62\n\
  PySAM     0.7.5\nPicard    1.107\nGATK      2.4-9\nTo just check your dependency\
  \ versions, run $ loeb-2.0.sh -v\n"
