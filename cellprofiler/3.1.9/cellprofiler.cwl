  doc: Load this pipeline file or project on startup. If specifying a pipeline file
    rather than a project, the -i flag is also needed unless the pipeline is saved
    with the file list.

- id: plugins_directory
  doc: CellProfiler will look for plugin modules in this directory (headless-only).
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --plugins-directory
- id: temporary_directory
  doc: Temporary directory. CellProfiler uses this for downloaded image files and
    for the measurements file, if not specified. The default is /tmp

- id: print_groups
  doc: Open the measurements file following the --print- groups switch and print the

    The output is a JSON-encoded data structure containing the group keys and values
    and the image sets in each group.

  inputBinding:
    prefix: --print-groups
- id: get_batch_commands
  doc: "Open the measurements file following the --get-batch- commands switch and\
    \ print one line to the console per group. The measurements file should be generated\
    \ using CreateBatchFiles and the image sets should be grouped into the units to\
    \ be run. Each line is a command to invoke CellProfiler. You can use this option\
    \ to generate a shell script that will invoke CellProfiler on a cluster by substituting\
    \ \"CellProfiler\" with your invocation command in the script's text, for instance:\
    \ CellProfiler --get-batch-commands Batch_data.h5 | sed s/CellProfiler/farm_jobs.sh.\
    \ Note that CellProfiler will always run in headless mode when --get-batch- commands\
    \ is present and will exit after generating the batch commands without processing\
    \ any pipeline."
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --get-batch-commands
- id: images_per_batch
