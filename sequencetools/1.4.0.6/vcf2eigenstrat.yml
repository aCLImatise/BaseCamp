  description: 'specify an Eigenstrat SNP file with the positions and alleles of a
    reference set. If this option is given, only positions that are both in the SNP
    file and in the VCF will be output. Without this option, all sites in the VCF
    will be output. WARNING: Sites that are not in the VCF will not be output, and
    this is new behaviour. Previously one could specify that they will be output as
    missing or hom-ref, but that feature was recently removed. I plan to implement
    this behaviour in the future in a new eigenstrat-merging tool.'
