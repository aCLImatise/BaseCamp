help_text: "\nUsage: ntdpal [-g <gval>] [-l <lval>] [-m <mval>]\n                \
  \ [-f2] [-p] [-s] [-e] <seq1> <seq2> <mode>\n\nwhere\n\n<gval> and <lval> are (positive)\
  \ floats (.01 precision)\n    specifying penalties for creating or lengthening a\
  \ gap\n    respectively (the penalties are subtracted from the\n    output score).\n\
  \n-a causes the scoring matrix to be modified by dpal_set_ambiguity_codes.\n\n-e\
  \ causes the end postion of the alignment in both sequences to\n   be printed. \
  \ Do not confuse with the 'e' <mode>.\n\n-f1, -f2, f3\n    force specific implementations.\n\
  \    -f2 forces use an implementation that might provide more\n    informative error\
  \ messages, possibly at the expense\n    of some speed.\n\n-h use a different scoring\
  \ matrix: G and C matches = 3, A and T = 2,\n   and mismatches = -0.5.\n   (The\
  \ default scoring matrix assigns 1 to a match,\n   and -1 to a mismatch.)\n\n-p\
  \ causes the alignment to be displayed on stderr.\n\n-s causes _only_ the score\
  \ to printed.\n\n<mval> is the maximum allowed gap (default is 3).\n\n<seq1> and\
  \ <seq2> are the sequences to be aligned.\n\n<mode> is one of g, G, l, or L specifying\
  \ a global,\n       global end-anchored, local, or local end-achored\n       alignment\
  \ respectively.  For backward compatibility\n       e is equivalent to G.\n\n"
