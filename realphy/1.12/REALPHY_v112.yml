  \ [Sequence folder] [Output folder] [Options]\nSequence folder needs to contain\
  \ fasta files ending with .fas, .fna, .fasta or .fa, genbank files ending in .gbk\
  \ or .gb and short read files in fastq format ending in .fastq or fastq.gz.\nThe\
  \ output folder needs to contain a file called \"config.txt\", which contains information\
  \ about the location of the required executables such as bowtie2.\n\nOptions:\n\
  -readLength [integer] default=50 Possible values: Integer greater than 30; Size\
  \ of fragments that are to be produced from the FASTA/GBK input sequences. With\
  \ longer read lengths the mapping will take longer but will also map more divergent\
  \ sequences.\n-quality [integer] default=20; Possible values: Integer value between\
  \ 0 and 41 that corresponds to quality values in fastq files (PHRED+33). Bases with\
  \ values below thresold in fastq file will not be considered (fasta files will be\
  \ converted into fastq files with a quality of 20).\n-polyThreshold [double] default=0.95;\
  \ Possible values: Double value between 0 and 1.  Polymorphisms that occur at lower\
  \ frequency than the specified threshold at any given position of the alignment\
  \ will not be considered.\n-perBaseCov [integer] default=10; Possible values: Integer\
  \ greater than or equal to 10.  Polymorphisms will only be extracted for regions\
  \ that are covered by more than the set threshold of reads.\n-ref [sequence file\
  \ name (without extension or path!)] default=random; Possible values: The file name\
  \ of a sequence data set without the extension (.fas, .fasta, .fa, .fna, .fastq,\
  \ .fastq.gz, .gb or .gbk). Sets the reference sequence.\n-root [sequence file name\
  \ (without extension or path!)] default=random; Possible values: The file name of\
  \ a sequence data set without the extension (.fas, .fasta, .fa, .fna, .fastq, .fastq.gz,\
  \ .gb or .gbk).  Specifies the root of the tree.\n-refN [sequence file name (without\
  \ extension or path!)] where N is the n-th reference genome; default=not set; Possible\
  \ values: The file name of a sequence data set without the extension (.fas, .fasta,\
  \ .fa, .fna, .fastq, .fastq.gz, .gb or .gbk).\n-genes If set then genes (CDS) are\
  \ extracted from a given genbank file.\n-gapThreshold [double] default=0; specifies\
  \ the proportion of input sequences that are allowed to contain gaps in the final\
  \ sequence alignment (i.e. if set to 0.2 at most 20% of all nucleotides in each\
  \ final alignment column are allowed to be gaps).\n-clean/-c If set then the whole\
  \ analysis will be rerun and existing data will be overwritten!\n-treeBuilder [integer]\
  \ default=4;\n   0=Do not build a tree;\n   1=treepuzzle; \n   2=raxml\n   3=max.\
  \ parsimony (dnapars)\n   4=PhyML (default)\n-quiet/-q If set then it suppresses\
  \ any program output except for errors or warnings.\n-varOnly/-v If set then homologous\
  \ positions that are conserved in all input sequences are put out. If set then the\
  \ reconstructed tree may be wrong.\n-seedLength [integer] default=22 Possible values:\
  \ Integer between 4 and 32; specifies k-mer length in bowtie2.\n-suffix [string]\
  \ default=not set; appends a suffix to the reference output folder.\n-d/-delete\
  \ If this option is set then all alignment output files and sequence cut files will\
  \ be deleted after the program is terminated.\n-merge/-m If this option is set multiple\
  \ references are selected, a final polymorphism file will be generated which combines\
  \ all polymorphism files for all references. \n-gaps/-g If this option is set. The\
  \ gapThreshold is automatically set to 100%, unless a different gapThreshold is\
  \ specified.\n-config [string] this specifies the location of the config.txt. If\
  \ not set it is assumed that the config.txt is in the working directory.\n-treeOptions\
  \ [text file] This option allows the user to provide command line parameters to\
  \ the tree program in the first line of a given text file.\n-bowtieOptions [text\
  \ file] This option allows the user to provide command line parameters to bowtie2\
  \ in the first line of a given text file.\n-h/-help Shows this help.\n-version Prints\
  \ the program's version.\nProgram execution took 1.6666666666666667E-5 minutes.\n"
