  description: Verification of the fasta file generated from the GFF file will be
    skipped if this flag is provided. The verification is mainly based on the length
    of the spacer sequences. If a spacer is 1.5 time shorter or longer than the average
    spacer size of the dataset, a warning is raised and the script stops (Verification
    is ran by default). Correction can be either made in the initial gff file or in
    the fasta file. If the later, provide the name of the fasta file after the flag
    (ex. -f corrected_sequences.fasta
