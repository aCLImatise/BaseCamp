!Command
command:
- /opt/conda/bin/pod2text
named:
- !Flag
  description: Use an alternate output format that, among other things, uses a different
    heading style and marks "=item" entries with a colon in the left margin.
  synonyms:
  - -a
  - --alt
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Include any non-POD text from the input file in the output as well.
    Useful for viewing code documented with POD blocks with the POD rendered and the
    code left intact.
  synonyms:
  - --code
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Format the output with ANSI color escape sequences. Using this option
    requires that Term::ANSIColor be installed on your system.
  synonyms:
  - -c
  - --color
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Set the error handling style. "die" says to throw an exception on any
    POD formatting error. "stderr" says to report errors on standard error, but not
    to throw an exception. "pod" says to include a POD ERRORS section in the resulting
    documentation summarizing the errors. "none" ignores POD errors entirely, as much
    as possible. The default is "die".
  synonyms:
  - --errors
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: style
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Set the number of spaces to indent regular text, and the default indentation
    for "=over" blocks. Defaults to 4 spaces if this option isn't given.
  synonyms:
  - -i
  - --indent
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: indent
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Print a blank line after a "=head1" heading. Normally, no blank line
    is printed after "=head1", although one is still printed after "=head2", because
    this is the expected formatting for manual pages; if you're formatting arbitrary
    text documents, using this option is recommended.
  synonyms:
  - -l
  - --loose
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The width of the left margin in spaces. Defaults to 0. This is the
    margin for all text, including headings, not the amount by which regular text
    is indented; for the latter, see -i option.
  synonyms:
  - -m
  - --left-margin
  - --margin
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: width
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Normally, L<> formatting codes with a URL but anchor text are formatted
    to show both the anchor text and the URL. In other words: L<foo|http://example.com/>
    is formatted as: foo <http://example.com/> This flag, if given, suppresses the
    URL when anchor text is given, so this example would be formatted as just "foo".
    This can produce less cluttered output in cases where the URLs are not particularly
    important.'
  synonyms:
  - --nourls
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Format the output with overstrike printing. Bold text is rendered as
    character, backspace, character. Italics and file names are rendered as underscore,
    backspace, character. Many pagers, such as less, know how to convert this to bold
    or underlined text.
  synonyms:
  - -o
  - --overstrike
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Sets the quote marks used to surround C<> text to quotes. If quotes
    is a single character, it is used as both the left and right quote. Otherwise,
    it is split in half, and the first half of the string is used as the left quote
    and the second is used as the right quote. quotes may also be set to the special
    value "none", in which case no quote marks are added around C<> text.
  synonyms:
  - -q
  - --quotes
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: quotes
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Assume each sentence ends with two spaces and try to preserve that
    spacing. Without this option, all consecutive whitespace in non-verbatim paragraphs
    is compressed into a single space.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  - --sentence
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, pod2text dies if any errors are detected in the POD input.
    If --stderr is given and no --errors flag is present, errors are sent to standard
    error, but pod2text does not abort. This is equivalent to "--errors=stderr" and
    is supported for backward compatibility.
  synonyms:
  - --stderr
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Try to determine the width of the screen and the bold and underline
    sequences for the terminal from termcap, and use that information in formatting
    the output. Output will be wrapped at two columns less than the width of your
    terminal device. Using this option requires that your system have a termcap file
    somewhere where Term::Cap can find it and requires that your system support termios.
    With this option, the output of pod2text will contain terminal control sequences
    for your current terminal type.
  synonyms:
  - -t
  - --termcap
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, pod2text tries to use the same output encoding as its input
    encoding (to be backward-compatible with older versions). This option says to
    instead force the output encoding to UTF-8. Be aware that, when using this option,
    the input encoding of your POD source should be properly declared unless it's
    US-ASCII. Pod::Simple will attempt to guess the encoding and may be successful
    if it's Latin-1 or UTF-8, but it will warn, which by default results in a pod2text
    failure. Use the "=encoding" command to declare the encoding. See perlpod(1) for
    more information.
  synonyms:
  - -u
  - --utf8
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The column at which to wrap text on the right-hand side. Defaults to
    76, unless -t is given, in which case it's two columns less than the width of
    your terminal device.
  synonyms:
  - -w
  - --width
  - -width
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: width
  optional: true
help_flag: !Flag
  description: Print out usage information and exit.
  synonyms:
  - -h
  - --help
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
positional: []
