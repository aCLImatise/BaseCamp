help_text: "\n\nThis program gets all fluxes (free, dependent and constrained) as\
  \ well as free pool values from kvh file\nand put them in a ftbl file for free/dependent\
  \ fluxes and free pools. Values are rounded to 9 digits\n(default value but can\
  \ be changed with -r option).\n\nThe first input parameter must point to a valid\
  \ _res.kvh file or to its prefix.\nIf the second parameter (ftbl name) is omitted,\
  \ it is derived from kvh file name.\n\nNames in kvh are like \"f.n.FLX\" or \"f.x.FLX\"\
  \ or \"pf:Glc6P\"\nNames in ftbl are like \"FLX\" in corresponding NET or XCH section\n\
  or like \"Glc6P\" in METABOLITE_POOLS\nIf a name in kvh file does not have its equivalent\
  \ in\nftbl file, it is silently ignored.\nOptional comments in the original ftbl\
  \ after the value of\nedited flux or pool are lost.\n\nNew content is sent to stdout\n\
