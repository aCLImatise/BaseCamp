    \ integers, separated by commas, specifying a\nrange of overlap sizes, as described\
    \ above. For example,\nif --min-overlap=2,4 is given, then three assemblies\n\
    will be produced, corresponding to --min-overlap=2,\n--min-overlap=3, and --min-overlap=4\

- id: in_alignment_policy
  doc: "The policy used to choose which alignment(s) of each read to\nuse in constructing\
    \ the \"true\" assembly. Options:\n* sample: For each read, sample a single alignment\
    \ (to\nsome reference transcript) according to the posterior\nprobability that\
    \ the read follows each alignment, as\ncalculated by RSEM.\n* best: For each read,\
    \ choose the alignment that maximizes\nthe posterior probability mentioned above.\
    \ Ties are\nbroken arbitrarily but deterministically (the first\nalignment in\
    \ the BAM file is used).\n* all: For each read, use all its alignments. Some reads\n\
    might end up with more than one alignment. In that case,\ncontigs will be made\
    \ assuming that the read aligns to\neach place. (In other words, the read is effectively\n\
    duplicated, with one copy per alignment.)\nThis policy is applied after the thresholding\
    \ implied by\n--min-alignment-prob. For example, if\n\"--min-alignment-prob=0.10\
    \ --alignment-policy=sample\" is\ngiven, then (first) all alignments with posterior\
    \ probability\nless than 0.10 will be discarded, and (second), for each\nread,\
    \ an alignment will be sampled from among the remaining\nalignments, with the\
    \ posterior distribution renormalized as\nappropriate. As another example, if\n\
    \"--min-alignment-prob=0.90 --alignment-policy=all\" is given,\nthen all alignments\
    \ with posterior probability at least 0.90\nwill be used.\nDefault: sample.\n"
