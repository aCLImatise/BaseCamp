    \ the assembly as \"true\" transcripts;\n'Number_of_alignable_reads', the number\
    \ of reads that have at least\none alignment found by the aligner (Because\n'rsem-calculate-expression'\
    \ tries to use a very loose criteria to\nfind alignments, reads with only low\
    \ quality alignments may also be\ncounted as alignable reads here); 'Number_of_alignments_in_total',\n\
    the number of total alignments found by the aligner.\n'sample_name.score.isoforms.results'\
    \ and\n'sample_name.score.genes.results' output \"corrected\" expression\nlevels\

    \ 'sample_name.score.isoforms.results' and\n'sample_name.score.genes.results'\

    better expression estimates for very short contigs. In addtion, the\n'TPM' field\
    \ is changed to 'CPM' field, which stands for contig per\nmillion.\nFor 'sample_name.score.isoforms.results',\
    \ one additional column is\nadded. The additional column is named as 'contig_impact_score'\

  \ and mutually\n        exclusive with '--estimate-transcript-length-distribution'.\n\
  \        (Default: learned from human Ensembl annotation and hg20 genome)\n\n  \
  \  --paired-end\n        Input reads are paired-end reads. (Default: off)\n\n  \
  \  --no-qualities\n        Input reads do not contain quality scores. (Default:\
  \ off)\n\n    --strand-specific\n        The RNA-Seq protocol used to generate the\
  \ reads is strand specific,\n        i.e., all (upstream) reads are derived from\
  \ the forward strand. This\n        option is equivalent to --forward-prob=1.0.\
  \ With this option set, if\n        RSEM-EVAL runs the Bowtie/Bowtie 2 aligner,\
  \ the '--norc'\n        Bowtie/Bowtie 2 option will be used, which disables alignment\
  \ to the\n        reverse strand of transcripts. (Default: off)\n\n    --bowtie2\n\
  \        Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align reads. Since currently\n      \
  \  RSEM-EVAL does not handle indel, local and discordant alignments,\n        the\
  \ Bowtie2 parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments.\n        In particular,\
  \ we use options '--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999\n        --mp 1,1 --np 1\
  \ --score-min L,0,-0.1' by default. \"-0.1\", the last\n        parameter of '--score-min'\
  \ is the negative value of the maximum\n        mismatch rate allowed. This rate\
  \ can be set by option\n        '--bowtie2-mismatch-rate'. If reads are paired-end,\
  \ we additionally\n        use options '--no-mixed' and '--no-discordant'. (Default:\

  \        and 'samtools sort' will use this many threads. (Default: 1)\n\n    --output-bam\n\
  \        Generate BAM outputs. (Default: off)\n\n    --sampling-for-bam\n      \
  \  When RSEM-EVAL generates a BAM file, instead of outputing all\n        alignments\
  \ a read has with their posterior probabilities, one\n        alignment is sampled\
  \ according to the posterior probabilities. The\n        sampling procedure includes\
  \ the alignment to the \"noise\" transcript,\n        which does not appear in the\
  \ BAM file. Only the sampled alignment\n        has a weight of 1. All other alignments\
  \ have weight 0. If the\n        \"noise\" transcript is sampled, all alignments\
  \ appeared in the BAM\n        file should have weight 0. (Default: off)\n\n   \
  \ --seed <uint32>\n        Set the seed for the random number generators used in\
  \ calculating\n        posterior mean estimates and credibility intervals. The seed\
  \ must be\n        a non-negative 32 bit interger. (Default: off)\n\n    -q/--quiet\n\

  \   Probability of generating a read from the forward strand of a\n        transcript.\
  \ Set to 1 for a strand-specific protocol where all\n        (upstream) reads are\

  \ (Default: off)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    In its default mode, this program builds indices,\
  \ aligns input reads\n    against a reference assembly with Bowtie and calculates\
  \ RSEM-EVAL score\n    and expression values using the alignments. RSEM-EVAL assumes\
  \ the data\n    are single-end reads with quality scores, unless the '--paired-end'\
  \ or\n    '--no-qualities' options are specified. Users may use an alternative\n\
  \    aligner by specifying one of the --sam and --bam options, and providing\n \
  \   an alignment file in the specified format. However, users should make\n    sure\
  \ that they align against 'assembly_fasta_file' and the alignment\n    file satisfies\
  \ the requirements mentioned in ARGUMENTS section.\n\n    The SAM/BAM format RSEM-EVAL\
  \ uses is v1.4. However, it is compatible\n    with old SAM/BAM format. However,\
  \ RSEM-EVAL cannot recognize 0x100 in\n    the FLAG field. In addition, RSEM-EVAL\
  \ requires SEQ and QUAL are not\n    '*'.\n\n    Please note that some of the default\
  \ values for the Bowtie parameters\n    are not the same as those defined for Bowtie\
  \ itself.\n\n    The temporary directory and all intermediate files will be removed\
  \ when\n    RSEM-EVAL finishes unless '--keep-intermediate-files' is specified.\n\
  \nOUTPUT\n    sample_name.score, sample_name.score.isoforms.results and\n    sample_name.score.genes.results\n\
  \        'sample_name.score' stores the evaluation score for the evaluated\n   \
  \     assembly. It contains 13 lines and each line contains a name and a\n     \
  \   value separated by a tab.\n\n        The first 6 lines provide: 'Score', the\
  \ RSEM-EVAL score;\n        'BIC_penalty', the BIC penalty term;\n        'Prior_score_on_contig_lengths_(f_function_canceled)',\
  \ the log score\n        of priors of contig lengths, with f function values excluded\
  \ (f\n        function is defined in equation (4) at page 5 of Additional file 1,\n\
  \        which is the supplementary methods, tables and figures of our\n       \

  \ +\n        Prior_score_on_contig_lengths + Prior_score_on_contig_sequences +\n\
  \        Data_likelihood_in_log_space_without_correction - Correction_term.\n  \
  \      Because both 'Prior_score_on_contig_lengths' and 'Correction_term'\n    \
  \    share the same f function values for each contig, the f function\n        values\
  \ can be canceled out. Then\n        'Prior_score_on_contig_lengths_(f_function_canceled)'\
  \ is the sum of\n        log $c_{\\lambda}(\\ell)$ terms in equation (9) at page\
  \ 5 of\n        Additional file 1. 'Correction_term_(f_function_canceled)' is the\n\
  \        sum of log $(1 - p_{\\lambda_i})$ terms in equation (23) at page 9 of\n\
  \        Additional file 1. For the correction term, we use $\\lambda_i$\n     \
  \   instead of $\\lambda'_i$ to make f function canceled out.\n\n        The next\
  \ 7 lines provide statistics that may help users to\n        understand the RSEM-EVAL\

  \ as alignable reads here); 'Number_of_alignments_in_total',\n        the number\
  \ of total alignments found by the aligner.\n\n        'sample_name.score.isoforms.results'\

  \        levels based on contig-level read generating probabilities mentioned\n\
  \        in section 4 of Additional file 1. Unlike\n        'sample_name.isoforms.results'\
  \ and 'sample_name.genes.results',\n        which are calculated by treating the\
  \ contigs as true transcripts,\n        calculating 'sample_name.score.isoforms.results'\
  \ and\n        'sample_name.score.genes.results' involves first estimating expected\n\
  \        read coverage for each contig and then convert the expected read\n    \
  \    coverage into contig-level read generating probabilities. This\n        procedure\
  \ is aware of that provided sequences are contigs and gives\n        better expression\
  \ estimates for very short contigs. In addtion, the\n        'TPM' field is changed\
  \ to 'CPM' field, which stands for contig per\n        million.\n\n        For 'sample_name.score.isoforms.results',\
  \ one additional column is\n        added. The additional column is named as 'contig_impact_score'\

  \       section 5 of Additional file 1.\n\n    sample_name.isoforms.results\n  \
  \      File containing isoform level expression estimates. The first line\n    \

  \ transcript belongs to\n        (denote this gene as its parent gene). If no gene\
  \ information is\n        provided, 'gene_id' and 'transcript_id' are the same.\n\
  \n        'length' is this transcript's sequence length (poly(A) tail is not\n \
  \       counted). 'effective_length' counts only the positions that can\n      \
  \  generate a valid fragment. If no poly(A) tail is added,\n        'effective_length'\
  \ is equal to transcript length - mean fragment\n        length + 1. If one transcript's\
  \ effective length is less than 1,\n        this transcript's both effective length\
  \ and abundance estimates are\n        set to 0.\n\n        'expected_count' is\
  \ the sum of the posterior probability of each\n        read comes from this transcript\
  \ over all reads. Because 1) each read\n        aligning to this transcript has\
  \ a probability of being generated\n        from background noise; 2) RSEM-EVAL\
  \ may filter some alignable low\n        quality reads, the sum of expected counts\
  \ for all transcript are\n        generally less than the total number of reads\
  \ aligned.\n\n        'TPM' stands for Transcripts Per Million. It is a relative\
  \ measure\n        of transcript abundance. The sum of all transcripts' TPM is 1\n\
  \        million. 'FPKM' stands for Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per\n \
  \       Million mapped reads. It is another relative measure of transcript\n   \
  \     abundance. If we define l_bar be the mean transcript length in a\n       \
  \ sample, which can be calculated as\n\n        l_bar = \\sum_i TPM_i / 10^6 * effective_length_i\
  \ (i goes through\n        every transcript),\n\n        the following equation\
  \ is hold:\n\n        FPKM_i = 10^3 / l_bar * TPM_i.\n\n        We can see that\
  \ the sum of FPKM is not a constant across samples.\n\n        'IsoPct' stands for\
  \ isoform percentage. It is the percentage of this\n        transcript's abandunce\
  \ over its parent gene's abandunce. If its\n        parent gene has only one isoform\
  \ or the gene information is not\n        provided, this field will be set to 100.\n\

  \        Only generated when --output-bam is specified.\n\n        'sample_name.transcript.bam'\
  \ is a BAM-formatted file of read\n        alignments in transcript coordinates.\
  \ The MAPQ field of each\n        alignment is set to min(100, floor(-10 * log10(1.0\
  \ - w) + 0.5)),\n        where w is the posterior probability of that alignment\
  \ being the\n        true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM-EVAL pads a new tag\n\
  \        ZW:f:value, where value is a single precision floating number\n       \
  \ representing the posterior probability. Because this file contains\n        all\
  \ alignment lines produced by bowtie or user-specified aligners,\n        it can\
  \ also be used as a replacement of the aligner generated\n        BAM/SAM file.\
  \ For paired-end reads, if one mate has alignments but\n        the other does not,\
  \ this file marks the alignable mate as\n        \"unmappable\" (flag bit 0x4) and\
  \ appends an optional field \"Z0:A:!\".\n\n        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam'\
  \ and\n        'sample_name.transcript.sorted.bam.bai' are the sorted BAM file and\n\
  \        indices generated by samtools (included in RSEM-EVAL package).\n\n    sample_name.time\n\
  \        Only generated when --time is specified.\n\n        It contains time (in\
  \ seconds) consumed by building references,\n        aligning reads, estimating\
  \ expression levels and calculating\n        credibility intervals.\n\n    sample_name.stat\n\
  \        This is a folder instead of a file. All model related statistics are\n\
  \        stored in this folder. Use 'rsem-plot-model' can generate plots\n     \
  \   using this folder.\n\nEXAMPLES\n    We want to compute the RSEM-EVAL score for\
  \ a contig assembly,\n    'assembly1.fa'. Our data are 76bp single-end reads contained\
  \ in\n    '/data/reads.fq'. The related species is human and\n    'human_transcripts.fa'\
  \ contains all human transcripts. We use 8 threads\n    and do not generate any\
  \ BAM files. In addition, we set the overlap size\n    w as 0 and 'sample_name'\
  \ as 'assembly1_rsem_eval'.\n\n    First, we need to estimate the true transcript\
  \ length distribution using\n    'human_transcripts.fa':\n\n     rsem-eval-estimate-transcript-length-distribution\
  \ human_transcripts.fa human.txt\n\n    Now, we can calculate RSEM-EVAL score:\n\
  \n     rsem-eval-calculate-score -p 8 \\\n                               --transcript-length-parameters\
  \ human.txt \\\n                               /data/reads.fq \\\n             \
  \                  assembly1.fa \\\n                               assembly1_rsem_eval\
  \ \\\n                               76\n\n    The RSEM-EVAL score can be found\
  \ in 'assembly1_rsem_eval.score' and the\n    contig impact scores can be found\
  \ in\n    'assembly1_rsem_eval.score.isoforms.results'.\n\n"
