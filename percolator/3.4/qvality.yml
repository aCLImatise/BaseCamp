  \ target_file null_file\nor\n   qvality [options] pvalue_file\n\ntarget_file and\
  \ null_file are files containing scores from a mixed model\nand a null model, each\
  \ score separated with whitespace or line feed.\nAlternatively, accuate p-value\
  \ could be provided in a single file pvalue_file.\n\nThe method reports score, PEP,\
  \ and q-value calculated directly from scores\nConvergence of the method can be\
  \ checked by comparing the average PEP of identifications\nabove threshold with\
