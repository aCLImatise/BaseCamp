  description: Q-value threshold that will be  used in the computation of the MSE  and

  description: Activates spectral counting on  protein level (either  --fido-protein
    or --picked-protein  has to be set) at the specified  PSM q-value threshold. Adds
    two  columns, "spec_count_unique" and  "spec_count_all", to the protein  tab separated
    output, containing  the spectral count for the  peptides unique to the protein
    and  the spectral count including  shared peptides respectively.

    set during each training  iteration. If the user only  provides one PSM per spectrum,  this
    filter will have no effect.

  description: Set the FDR threshold for the  first iteration. This is useful in  cases
