  description: Create all output files in the specified output directory. Please note
    that this directory must exist as the program will not create it.  If this option
    is not set then the  output file for each sequence file is created in the same
    directory as the sequence file which was processed.

  description: Files come from raw casava output. Files in the same sample group (differing
    only by the group number) will be analysed as a set rather than individually.
    Sequences with the filter flag set in the header will be excluded from the analysis.
    Files must have the same names given to them by casava (including being gzipped
    and ending with .gz) otherwise they won't be grouped together correctly.

  description: 'Files come from nanopore sequences and are in fast5 format. In this
    mode you can pass in directories to process and the program will take in all fast5
    files within those directories and produce a single output file from the sequences
    found in all files.                    '

  description: If set then the zipped output file will be uncompressed in the same

  description: 'Disable grouping of bases for reads >50bp. All reports will show data
    for every base in the read.  WARNING: Using this option will cause fastqc to crash
    and burn if you use it on really long reads, and your plots may end up a ridiculous
    size. You have been warned!'

  description: Sets an artificial lower limit on the length of the sequence to be
    shown in the report.  As long as you set this to a value greater or equal to your
    longest read length then this will be the sequence length used to create your
    read groups.  This can be useful for making directly comaparable statistics from  datasets
    with somewhat variable read lengths.
