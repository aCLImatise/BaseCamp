  description: This file is a m by n matrix. m is the number of genes/transcripts
    and n is the number of total samples. Each element in the matrix represents the
    expected count for a particular gene/transcript in a particular sample. Users
    can use 'rsem-generate-data-matrix' to generate this file from expression result
    files.
