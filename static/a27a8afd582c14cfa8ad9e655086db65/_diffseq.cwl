  doc: integer    [10] The similar regions between the two sequences are found by
    creating a hash table of 'wordsize'd subsequences. 10 is a reasonable default.
    Making this value larger (20?) may speed up the program slightly, but will mean
    that any two differences within 'wordsize' of each other will be grouped as a
    single region of difference. This value may be made smaller (4?) to improve the
    resolution of nearby differences, but the program will go much slower. (Integer
    2 or more)
