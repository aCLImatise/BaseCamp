  doc: "If the filename is given as \"-\" then the input is taken from standard input.\
    \ Compressed files (.gz, .Z, .bz2) are automatically uncompressed. FASTA format\
    \ files are distinguished from GFF files by their filename extensions. Files ending\
    \ in .fa, .fasta, .fast, .seq, .dna and their uppercase variants are treated as\
    \ FASTA files. Everything else is treated as a GFF file. If you wish to load -fasta\
    \ files from STDIN, then use the -f command-line swith with an argument of '-',\
    \ as in gunzip my_data.fa.gz | bp_fast_load_gff.pl -d test -f - The nature of\
    \ the load requires that the database be on the local machine and that the indicated\
    \ user have the \"file\" privilege to load the tables and have enough room in\
    \ /usr/tmp (or whatever is specified by the \\$TMPDIR environment variable), to\
    \ hold the tables transiently. If your MySQL is version 3.22.6 and was compiled\
    \ using the \"load local file\" option, then you may be able to load remote databases\
    \ with local data using the --local option. About maxfeature: the default value\
    \ is 100,000,000 bases. If you have features that are close to or greater that\
    \ 100Mb in length, then the value of maxfeature should be increased to 1,000,000,000.\
    \ This value must be a power of 10. If the list of GFF or fasta files exceeds\
    \ the kernel limit for the maximum number of command-line arguments, use the --long_list\
    \ /path/to/files option. The adaptor used is dbi::mysqlopt. There is currently\
    \ no way to change this."
