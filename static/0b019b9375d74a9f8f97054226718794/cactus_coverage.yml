help_text: "cactus_coverage: unrecognized option '--help'\ncactus_coverage fastaFile\
  \ alignmentsFile\nPrints a bed file representing coverage from a CIGAR file on the\
  \ sequences provided in the fasta file.\nFormat: seq\tregionStart\tregionStop\t\
  coverageDepthOptions:\n--onlyContig1: Only print coverage that occurs when a sequence\
  \ from the fasta is in the contig1 field of the CIGAR.\n--onlyContig2: Only print\
  \ coverage that occurs when a sequence from the fasta is in the contig2 field of\
  \ the CIGAR.\n--depthById: Assume that headers have an 'id=N|' prefix, where N is\
  \ an integer. Score coverage depth by the number of different prefixes that align\
  \ to a region, rather than the total number of alignments. Uses much more memory\
  \ than the standard mode.\n--from <fromFastaFile>: Only consider alignments for\
  \ which one sequence is in fastaFile and the other is in fromFastaFile.\n"
