  \ DEL_INS_DUP_MAX_DISTANCE\n                        Maximum span-position distance\
  \ between the origin of\n                        an insertion and a deletion to\

  GENOTYPE:\n  --skip_genotyping     Disable genotyping (default: False)\n  --minimum_score\
  \ MINIMUM_SCORE\n                        Minimum score for genotyping (default:\
  \ 3). Only SV\n                        candidates with a higher or equal score are\
  \ genotyped.\n                        Depending on the score distribution among\
  \ the SV\n                        candidates, decreasing this value increases the\n\
  \                        runtime. We recommend to choose a value close to the\n\

  \  --homozygous_threshold HOMOZYGOUS_THRESHOLD\n                        Minimum\
  \ variant allele frequency to be called as\n                        homozygous (default:\

  \ reads supporting the\n                        variant over the total number of\
  \ reads covering the\n                        variant. Variants with an allele frequence\

  \                computed as the fraction of reads supporting the\n            \
  \            variant over the total number of reads covering the\n             \
  \           variant. Variants with an allele frequence greater\n               \
  \         than or equal to this threshold but lower than the\n                 \
  \       homozygous threshold are called as heterozygous\n                      \
  \  alternative. Variants with an allele frequence lower\n                      \
  \  than this threshold are called as homozygous\n                        reference.\n\
  \  --minimum_depth MINIMUM_DEPTH\n                        Minimum total read depth\

  \ number of reads lower than\n                        this value are not assigned\
  \ a genotype (./. in the\n                        output VCF file).\n\nOUTPUT:\n\
  \  --sample SAMPLE       Sample ID to include in output vcf file (default:\n   \
  \                     Sample)\n  --types TYPES         SV types to include in output\
  \ VCF (default:\n                        DEL,INS,INV,DUP:TANDEM,DUP:INT,BND). Give\
  \ a comma-\n                        separated list of SV types. The possible SV\
  \ types are:\n                        DEL (deletions), INS (novel insertions), INV\n\
  \                        (inversions), DUP:TANDEM (tandem duplications),\n     \
  \                   DUP:INT (interspersed duplications), BND (breakends).\n  --sequence_alleles\
  \    Use nucleotide sequences for alleles of deletions,\n                      \
  \  inversions and insertions in output VCF (default:\n                        False).\
  \ By default, all SVs are represented by\n                        symbolic alleles,\
  \ such as <DEL>, <INV> or <INS>. If\n                        enabled, ALT alleles\
  \ of insertions are obtained from\n                        the sequence of a random\

  \                        Output insertion sequences in INFO tag of VCF\n       \
  \                 (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/SEQS tag\n            \
  \            contains a list of insertion sequences from the\n                 \
  \       supporting reads. However, the insertion sequences are\n               \

  \                        VCF (default: False). By default, tandem duplications\n\
  \                        are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:TANDEM and the\n    \
  \                    genomic source is given by the POS and END tags. When\n   \
  \                     enabling this option, duplications are instead\n         \
  \               represented by the SVTYPE=INS and POS and END both\n           \
  \             give the insertion point of the duplication.\n  --interspersed_duplications_as_insertions\n\
  \                        Represent interspersed duplications as insertions in\n\
  \                        output VCF (default: False). By default, interspersed\n\
  \                        duplications are represented by the SVTYPE=DUP:INT and\n\

  \          Output names of supporting reads in INFO tag of VCF\n               \
  \         (default: False). If enabled, the INFO/READS tag\n                   \
