  \n\nTASK:\n\n  Shape-it is a tool to align pairs of molecules based on their maximal\n\
  \  volume overlap.\n\n\nREQUIRED OPTIONS: \n  -r, --reference <file>\n         \
  \  File of the reference molecule with 3D coordinates.\n           Only the first\
  \ molecule in the reference file will be used.\n           Shape-it can also handle\
  \ a gzipped files if the extension is '.gz'\n           All input formats which\
  \ are recognized by OpenBabel are allowed.\n  -d, --dbase <file>\n           File\
  \ of the database molecules with 3D coordinates.\n           Shape-it can also handle\
  \ gzipped files if the extension is '.gz'\n           All input formats which are\
  \ recognized by OpenBabel are allowed.\n\n\nOUTPUT OPTIONS: \nOne of these two output\
  \ options is required:\n\n  -o, --out <file>\n           File to write all database\
  \ or the N best molecules such that their\n           coordinates correspond to\
  \ the best alignment with the reference molecule.\n           The first molecule\
  \ in the file is the reference molecule. When this file\n           if of type 'sdf',\
  \ then each molecule contains a set of properties in which\n           the respective\
  \ scores are reported. These fields are labeled with an\n           identifier starting\
  \ with the tag Shape-it::\n\n  -s, --scores <file>\n           Tab-delimited text\
  \ file with the scores of molecules.\n           When the N best scoring molecules\
  \ are reported the molecules are ranked\n           with the descending scores.\n\
  \n\nOPTIONAL OPTIONS: \n\n  -f, --format <format>\n          Specifies the format\
  \ of the reference, database and output files. If not\n          provided, then\
  \ the formats are determined from the respective file extensions.\n          The\
  \ specified format string should be one of the formats recognised\n          by\
  \ OpenBabel.\n\n  --best <N> \n           When this option is used, only the N best\
  \ scoring alignments will be\n           reported. The scoring function is defined\
  \ by the --rankBy option.\n           By default all molecules in the database are\
  \ reported with their\n           respective scores without any ordering.\n\n  --scoreOnly\n\
  \           When this option is used the molecules are not aligned, only the volume\n\
  \           overlap between the reference and the given pose is computed.\n\n  --addIterations\
  \ <nbr>\n           Sets the number of additional iterations in the simulated annealing\n\
  \           optimization step. The default value is set to 0, which refers to only\n\
  \           a local gradient ascent. Increasing the number of iterations will add\n\
  \           additional steps, and might give better alignments but it also takes\n\
  \           more time.\n\n  --rankBy <code>\n           This option can be used\
  \ in combination with --best of --cutoff to rank\n           the molecules according\
  \ to a given scoring function. The type of scoring\n           function is indicated\
  \ with a code:\n             - TANIMOTO = Taninoto\n             - TVERSKY_REF =\
  \ reference Tversky\n             - TVERSKY_DB = database Tversky\n           By\
  \ default TANIMOTO is used.\n\n  --cutoff <value>\n           Defines a cutoff value.\
  \ Only molecules with a score higher than the\n           cutoff are reported in\
  \ the results files. Default value is set to\n           0.0. The scoring function\
  \ is defined by the --rankBy option.\n\n  --noRef\n           By default the reference\
  \ molecule is written in the output files.\n           Use this option to switch\
  \ off this behavior.\n\n\nHELP: \n\n  -h, --help\n           Prints this help overview.\n\
  \n  -v, --version\n           Prints the version of the program.\n\n"
