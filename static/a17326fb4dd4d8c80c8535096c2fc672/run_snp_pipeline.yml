  description: 'Create a mirror copy of the reference directory and all the sample
    directories.  Use this option to avoid polluting the reference directory and sample
    directories with the intermediate files generated by the snp pipeline.  A "reference"
    subdirectory and a "samples" subdirectory are created under the output directory
    (see the -o option).  One directory per sample is created under the "samples"
    directory. Three suboptions allow a choice of how the reference and samples are
    mirrored. -m soft : creates soft links to the fasta and fastq files instead of
    copying -m hard : creates hard links to the fasta and fastq files instead of copying

    created if it does not already exist. If not specified, the output files are written
    to the current working directory. If you re- run the pipeline on previously processed

    contain only a collection of sample directories, nothing else. Note: Unless you

    Note: If you are not mirroring the samples (see the -m option), you can improve
    parallel processing performance by sorting the the list of directories descending
    by size, largest first. The -m option automatically generates a sorted directory
    list. Note: You must specify either the -s or -S option, but not both. Note: Unless
