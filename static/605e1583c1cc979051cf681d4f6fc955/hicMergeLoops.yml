help_text: "usage: hicMergeLoops --inputFiles INPUTFILES [INPUTFILES ...] --outFileName\n\

  \                     [--version]\n\nThis script merges the locations of loops detected\
  \ at several resolutions.\n\nLoops in the inputFiles need to have the following\
  \ format:\n\nchr start end chr start end\n\nLoops are merged if the x and y position\
  \ of a loop overlap with the x and y position of another loop; all loops are considered\
  \ as an overlap within +/- the bin size of the lowest resolution.\nI.e. for a loop\
  \ with coordinates x and y, the overlap with all other loops is checked for (x -\
  \ lowest resolution) and (y + lowest resolution).\nIf two or more locations are\
  \ to be merged, the loop at the lowest resolution is taken as the merged loop.\n\
  \nExample usage:\n\n`$ hicMergeLoops -i gm12878_10kb.bedgraph gm12878_5kb.bedgraph\
  \ gm12878_25kb.bedgraph -o merged_result.bedgraph -r 25000`\n\nPlease recall: We\
  \ work with binned data i.e. the lowest resolution is therefore the one where we\
  \ merge the most bases into one bin. In the above example the lowest resultion is\
  \ 25kb, the highest resolution is 5kb.\n\nRequired arguments:\n  --inputFiles INPUTFILES\
  \ [INPUTFILES ...], -i INPUTFILES [INPUTFILES ...]\n                        The\
  \ loop files from hicDetectLoops. To use files from\n                        other\
  \ sources, please follow 'chr start end chr start\n                        end'\
  \ format and remove any header.\n  --outFileName OUTFILENAME, -o OUTFILENAME\n \
  \                       The name of the merged loop file.\n  --lowestResolution\
  \ LOWESTRESOLUTION, -r LOWESTRESOLUTION\n                        The lowest resolution\
  \ of all loop files, i.e. 5kb,\n                        10kb and 25kb, please use\
  \ 25000.\n\nOptional arguments:\n  --help, -h            show this help message\
  \ and exit\n  --version             show program's version number and exit\n"
