  description: "Sequence left by the restriction enzyme after cutting. Each restriction\
    \ enzyme recognizes a different DNA sequence and, after cutting, they leave behind\
    \ a specific \"sticky\" end or dangling end sequence. For example, for HindIII\
    \ the restriction site is AAGCTT and the dangling end is AGCT. For DpnII, the\
    \ restriction site and dangling end sequence are the same: GATC. This information\
    \ is easily found on the description of the restriction enzyme. The dangling sequence\
    \ is used to classify and report reads whose 5' end starts with such sequence\
    \ as dangling-end reads. A significant portion of dangling-end reads in a sample\
    \ are indicative of a problem with the re-ligation step of the protocol. It is\
    \ highly recommended to set this parameter to get a good quality report. (default:\
    \ None)"
