  \n\nName:\n    agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl\n\nDescription:\n    This script fixes\
  \ and/or standardizes any GTF/GFF file into full sorted\n    GFF3 file. The output\
  \ GFF syntax is shaped by bioperl and choose among\n    the versions 1,2,2.5 (GTF\
  \ equivalent) and 3. For a correct GTF file it\n    is recommended to use agat_convert_sp_gff2gtf.pl\n\
  \n    Without specifying an input GTF/GFF version, the Omniscient parser will\n\
  \    first detect automtically the most appropriate GFF parser to use from\n   \
  \ bioperl (GFF1,GFF2,GFF3) in order to read you file properly. Then the\n    Omniscient\
  \ parser removes duplicate features, fixes duplicated IDs, adds\n    missing ID\
  \ and/or Parent attributes, deflates factorized attributes\n    (attributes with\
  \ several parents are duplicated with uniq ID), add\n    missing features when possible\
  \ (e.g add exon if only CDS described, add\n    UTR if CDS and exon described),\
  \ fix feature locations (e.g check exon is\n    embeded in th parent features mRNA,\
  \ gene), etc... All AGAT's scripts\n    with the _sp_ prefix use the same parser,\
  \ before to perform suplement\n    tasks. whith the script you can tuned the Omniscient\
  \ parser behaviour.\n    I.e you can decide to merge loci that have an overlap at\
  \ their CDS\n    features ( Only one top feature is kept (gene), and the mRNA features\n\
  \    become isoforms). This is not activated by default in case you are\n    working\
  \ on a prokaryote annotation that often have overlaping loci. The\n    Omniscient\
  \ parser defines relationship between features using 3 levels.\n    e.g Level1=gene;\
  \ Level2=mRNA,tRNA; Level3=exon,cds,utr. The feature type\n    information is stored\
  \ within the 3rd column of a GTF/GFF file. Which\n    level a feature is part of\
  \ is crucial for the parser. This information\n    is stored by default in a json\
  \ file coming with the tool. We have\n    implemented the most common feature types\
  \ met in gff. If a feature type\n    in your file is not imprelement the parser\
  \ will not handle it and inform\n    you. You could easily inform the parser how\
  \ to handle it (level1,level2\n    or level3) by adding it in the corresponding\
  \ file. How to access the\n    json files? Easy just use the --expose option and\
  \ the json files will\n    appear in the workoing folder. If they are present, the\
  \ Omniscient\n    parser use the json files from the working direcrtory by default.\n\
  \n    Omniscient parser phylosophy:\n\n     Parse by Parent/child relationship\n\
  \       ELSE Parse by a comomn tag  (an attribute value shared by feature that must\
  \ be grouped together.\n            By default we are using locus_tag and gene_id\
  \ as locus tag, but you can specify the one of your choice\n         ELSE Parse\
  \ sequentially (features are grouped in a bucket, and the bucket change at each\
  \ level2 feature met, and bucket(s) are linked to the first l1 top feature met)\n\
  \nUsage:\n        agat_convert_sp_gxf2gxf.pl -g infile.gff [ -o outfile ]\n    \

  \        Input GTF/GFF file.\n\n    -c or --ct\n            When the features do\
  \ not have Parent/ID relationships, the\n            parser will try to group features\
  \ using a common/shared\n            attribute (i.e. a locus tag.). By default locus_tag\
  \ and gene_id.\n            You can replace the default common/shared attributes\
  \ by\n            providing your own(s) using this option. Use comma separated\n\
  \            list when providing several.\n\n    --efl or --expose\n           \
  \ If you want to see, add or modified the feature relationships\n            you\
  \ will have to use this option. It will copy past in you\n            working directory\

  \ and their level organisation. Typical\n            level organisation: Level1\
  \ => gene; Level2 => mRNA; level3 =>\n            exon,cds,utrs If you get warning\
  \ from the Omniscient parser that\n            a feature relationship is not defined,\
  \ you can provide\n            information about it within the exposed json files.\
