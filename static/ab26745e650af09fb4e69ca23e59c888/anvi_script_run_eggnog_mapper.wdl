    cog_data_dir: "The directory path for your COG setup if you did not use the default directory."
    num_threads: "Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast."
    drop_previous_annotations: "When declared, previous annotations in the database will be dropped."
    annotation: "If you have an annotation file from a previous run, you can call this program to import the contents of that file into the database instead of a run from scratch. In that case, you must also use the `--use- version` parameter to clarify which parser version should be used to parse it."
    use_version: "The version of eggnog-mapper that generated the annotation file."
