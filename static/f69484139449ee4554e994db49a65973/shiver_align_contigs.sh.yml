help_text: "Arguments for this script: (1) the initialisation directory you created\
  \ using the shiver_init.sh command; (2) the configuration file, containing all your\
  \ parameter choices etc.; (3) a fasta file of contigs (output from processing the\
  \ short reads with an assembly program); (4) A sample ID (\"SID\") used for naming\
  \ the output from this script (a sensible choice might be the contig file name minus\
  \ its path and extension). If this script completes successfully it will produce\
  \ a .blast file (detailing the contigs that have blast hits). If the .blast file\
  \ is not empty it will produce a fasta file of those contigs with hits and another\
  \ fasta file of these contigs aligned to the refereces; if cutting and/or reversing\
  \ of contigs is necessary, two more fasta files are produced - the cut/reversed\
  \ contigs on their own and also aligned to references (i.e. there will be two files\
  \ of the contigs on their own and two files of the contigs aligned to references).\n"
