  \           FASTA/FASTQ\n\nGroup sequences that share a unique molecular identifier\
  \ (UMI, barcode)\n\nSince the same barcode can sometimes be used by different sequences,\
  \ the CDR3\nsequence can further be used to distinguish sequences. You can choose\
  \ between\nusing either a 'pseudo CDR3' sequence, which encompasses by default bases\
  \ 80\nto 61 counted from the 3' end. Or you can use the real CDR3 detected with\
  \ a\nregular expression.\n\nIf grouping by CDR3s is enabled, sequences with identical\
  \ barcode and CDR3\nmust additionally have a similar length. If the length differs\
  \ by more than\n2 bp, they are put into different groups.\n\nThe barcode can be\
  \ in the 5' end or the 3' end of the sequence.\n\nUse --trim-g to remove initial\
  \ runs of G at the 5' end (artifact from RACE protocol).\nThese are removed after\
  \ the barcode is removed.\n\nFor all the found groups, one sequence is output to\
  \ standard output (in FASTA\nformat). Which sequence that is depends on the group\
  \ size:\n- If the group consists of a single sequence, that sequence is output\n\
  - If the group consists of two sequences, one of them is picked randomly\n- If the\
  \ group has at least three sequences, a consensus is computed. The\n  consensus\
  \ is output if it contains no ambiguous bases. Otherwise, also here a\n  random\
  \ sequence is chosen.\n\npositional arguments:\n  FASTA/FASTQ           FASTA or\
