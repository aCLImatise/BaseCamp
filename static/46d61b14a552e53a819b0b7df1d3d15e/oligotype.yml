  description: Minimum quality score for each base in locations of interest of a read
    to be considered in an oligotype. When base quality score files are provided,
    this value makes sure that low quality bases that are more likely to be the result
    of random sequencing errors do not create artificial oligotypes. Any read that
    has less quality score than the given value, will simply be discarded. This parameter
    only in effect when --qual- scores-file or --qual-scores-dict parameters are used.
    Defeault is 15.

  description: Minimum number of samples oligotype expected to appear. The deafult
    is "5", which is another completely arbitrary value. This parameter should be
    defined based on the number of samples included in the analysis. If there are
    10 samples, 3 might be a good choice, if there are 5 samples, 1 would be a better
    one depending on the study. Default is 1.

  description: Minimum percent abundance of an oligotype in at least one sample. The
    default is "0.0". Just like --min- number-of-samples parameter, this parameter
    too is to eliminate oligotypes that are formed by sequencing errors occured at
    the component of interest. The value should be decided based on the average number
    of sequences every sample has.

  description: Minimum total abundance of an oligotype in all datastes. The default

  description: Unlike "actual" abundance, "substantive" abundance is interested in
    the abundance of the most abundant read in an oligotype. If the abundance of the
    most abundant unique sequence in an oligotype smaller than the number given with
    this parameter the oligotype will be eliminated and not included in downstream
    analyses. Default is 0.

  description: At the end of the oligotyping sequences that are being represented
    by the same oligotype are being uniqued and stored in separate files. The number
    of sequences to keep from the frequency ordered list can be defined with this
    parameter (e.g. -l 10 would make it possible that only first 10 sequence would
    be stored). Default is 0, which stores everything, but when the sample size is
    too big, this could take up disk space.
