  \n\U0001F525 Program description:\n\n   Corrects homopolymer-region associated INDELs\
  \ in a given genome based on a\n   reference genome. The most effective use of this\
  \ script is when the input\n   genome is a genome reconstructed by minION long reads,\
  \ and the reference\n   genome is one that is of high-quality. Essentially, this\
  \ script will BLAST\n   the genome you wish to correct against the reference genome\
  \ you provide,\n   identify INDELs in the BLAST results that are exclusively associated\
  \ with\n   homopolymer regions, and will take the reference genome as a guide to\
  \ correct\n   the input sequences, and report a new FASTA file. You can use the\
  \ output\n   FASTA file that is fixed as the input FASTA file over and over again\
  \ to see\n   if you can eliminate all homopolymer-associated INDELs\n\n\U0001F9C0\
