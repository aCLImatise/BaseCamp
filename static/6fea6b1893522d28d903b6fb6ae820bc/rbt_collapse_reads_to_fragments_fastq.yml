  Tool to merge sets of reads from paired FASTQ files that share the UMI and have\
  \ similar read sequence. The result is a\nmaximum likelihood fragment sequence per\
  \ set with base quality scores improved accordingly.\n\nTakes two FASTQ files (forward\
  \ and reverse) and returns two FASTQ files in which all PCR duplicates have been\
  \ merged\ninto a consensus read. Duplicates are identified by a Unique Molecular\
  \ Identifier (UMI).\n\nAssumptions: - Reads are of equal length - UMI is the prefix\
  \ of the reads\n\nExample: rbt collapse-reads-to-fragments fastq \\ reads_1.fq reads_2.fq\
  \ \\    # input files merged_1.fq merged_2.fq \\  #\noutput files -l 13 \\     \
  \               # length of UMI -d 1 \\                     # max hamming distance\
  \ of UMIs within\na cluster -D 2 \\                     # max hamming distance of\
  \ sequences within a cluster --umi-on-reverse           #\nUMI is the prefix of\
  \ the reverse read\n\nUSAGE:\n    rbt collapse-reads-to-fragments fastq [FLAGS]\
