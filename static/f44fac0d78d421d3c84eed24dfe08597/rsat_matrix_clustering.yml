  \ as input one or several sets of position-specific scoring\n    matrices (PSSM),\
  \ this program applies hierarchical clustering to\n    identify clusters of similar\
  \ motifs. It produces a set of trees (one per\n    cluster) and builds branch motifs\
  \ at each node of each tree by merging\n    the matrices of all descendent nodes.\n\

  \n\e[1mUSAGE\e[0m\n    matrix-clustering [-matrix inputfile] [-o outputfile] [-v\
  \ ] [...]\n\n\e[1mOUTPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    This program produces a large number of\
  \ files (similarity matrix, motifs\n    for the internal nodes and roots of the\
  \ motif clusters, dynamic trees to\n    visualised the motif clusters, ...\n\n \
  \   These files are accessible via an html page\n    [output_prefix]_SUMMARY.html.\
  \ The program also produces a zip archive\n    with all the files to facilitate\
  \ the transfer from a server to the local\n    computer.\n\n\e[1mSEE ALSO\e[0m\n\
  \    \e[33mcompare-matrices\e[0m\n        The program \e[33mcompare-matrices\e[0m\
  \ is used by \e[33mcluster-matrices\e[0m to measure\n        pairwise similarities\
  \ and define the best alignment (offset, strand)\n        between each pair of matrices.\n\
  \n\e[1mDEPENDENCIES\e[0m\n    Some R packages are required in \e[33mmatrix-clustering\e\
  [0m in order to convert\n    the hierarchical tree into different output formats,\
  \ to manipulate the\n    dendrogram which is exported, and to produce heatmaps.\n\

  \   The JavaScript library \e[33mD3\e[0m (Data Driven Documents) is required to\n\

  \ connect directly with the server to load\n    the functions of this library.\n\
  \n        D3 : http://d3js.org/\n\n    As many files are produced with \e[33mmatrix-clustering\e\
  [0m we create a dynamic\n    web page giving access to the complete list of results.\

  [0m\n        Same as -h\n\n    \e[1m-matrix matrix_title input_matrix_file\e[0m\n\
  \        The input file contains a set of position-specific scoring matrices.\n\n\
  \        Example: -matrix OCt_motifs Oct_motifs_peakmotifs.tf tf\n\n        The\
  \ matrix_title will be concatenated to each motif ID in order to\n        create\
  \ unique motif IDs. The collection label is displayed in the\n        results.\n\
  \n        This label is useful when two motifs for the same TF come from\n     \
  \   different files and the user wants to know to which collection does\n      \
  \  the motif come from.\n\n        \e[1mSupported matrix formats\e[0m\n\n      \
  \  Since the program takes several matrices as input, it only accepts\n        matrices\
  \ in formats supporting several matrices per file (transfac,\n        tf, tab, cluster-buster,\
  \ cb, infogibbs, meme, stamp, uniprobe).\n\n        For a description of these formats,\
  \ see the help of \e[33mconvert-matrix\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-matrix_file_table matrix_file_table\e\
  [0m\n        This option is recommended when the input number of files is large\n\
  \        (> 20), which would have a large command line and some programs are\n \
  \       not capable of read such large arguments.\n\n        The input file contains\
  \ a tab-delimited table with two columns:\n\n        1) The motif file - The path\
  \ to the file with the motif 2) The\n        collection label\n\n        Example:\n\
  \n        Sox_pssms.tf Sox Oct_pssms.tf Oct Nanog_pssms.tf Nanog\n\n    \e[1m-matrix_format\
  \ matrix_format\e[0m\n        Specify the input matrix format.\n\n        \e[1mSupported\
  \ matrix formats\e[0m\n\n        Since the program takes several matrices as input,\
  \ it only accepts\n        matrices in formats supporting several matrices per file\
  \ (transfac,\n        tf, tab, clusterbuster, cb, infogibbs, meme, stamp, uniprobe).\n\
  \n        For a description of these formats, see the help of \e[33mconvert-matrix\e\
  [0m.\n\n    \e[1m-ref_collection Matrix_collection_file Matrix_format\e[0m\n   \
  \     This option allows to annotate the root motifs according to a\n        reference\
  \ motif database.\n\n        Use this option when you cluster motifs obtained from\
  \ a motif\n        discovery algorithm.\n\n        Example: -ref_collection Jaspar_vertebrates_2020.tf\
  \ tf\n\n    \e[1m-seq Sequence_file Seq_format\e[0m\n        This option allows\
  \ to generate the branch (including the root)\n        motifs from an input set\
  \ of sequences. Instead of sum or average the\n        counts, the new marged matrix\
  \ will be built from the sites found in\n        the provided sequences, this will\
  \ produce a more realistic matrix\n        suppoted by real sequences.\n\n     \
  \   Example: -seq Oct4_peaks.fa fasta\n\n    \e[1m-rescan_iter #\e[0m\n        Default:\
  \ 3\n\n        Number of times each matrix is re-scanned in a provided set of\n\
  \        sequences before producing the branch motifs.\n\n        Use this option\
  \ in combination with -seq parameter.\n\n    \e[1m-ID_link_color_table matrix_ID_link_color_table\e\
  [0m\n        This option allows to add a link to a any website specified by the\n\
  \        user and can be used to visualize complete databases (e.g. Jaspar),\n \
  \       thus each motif in the logo tree will point to its respective link\n   \
  \     in the Jaspar website.\n\n        Format: a tab-separated file Column 1: Motif\
  \ ID (the same as the\n        input motif file) Column 2: Link to any website Column\
  \ 3: Color in\n        Hexadecimal code\n\n        This option may be combined with\
  \ the -radial_tree_only. By default\n        the motifs names will be displayed\
  \ in black, unless the third color\n        is specified.\n\n    \e[1m-title title\e\
  [0m\n        Title displayed on top of the report page.\n\n    \e[1m-radial_tree_only\e\
  [0m\n        Generates a radial motif tree (option recommended for visualization\n\
  \        purposes). When this option is indicated, all the input motifs are\n  \
  \      forced to be aligned in a single alignment displayed in a radial\n      \
  \  tree (this tree is not interactive). This option skips the\n        generation\
  \ of branch-motifs and the generation of the dynamic output\n        (e.g., heatmaps).\n\
  \n    \e[1m-o output_prefix\e[0m\n        Prefix for the output files.\n\n     \
  \   Mandatory option: since the program \e[33mcluster-matrices\e[0m returns a list\n\
  \        of output files (pairwise matrix comparisons, matrix clusters).\n\n   \
  \ \e[1m-heatmap_position_tree [row,col,both,none]\e[0m\n        The position in\
  \ the heatmap where the hierarchical tree will be\n        displayed.\n\n    \e\
  [1m-task tasks\e[0m\n        Specify one or several tasks to be run. If this option\
  \ is not\n        specified, all the tasks are run.\n\n        Note that some tasks\
  \ depend on others. This option should thus be\n        used with caution, by advanced\
  \ users only.\n\n        Supported tasks: (all, comparison, clustering, report)\n\
  \n        \e[1mall\e[0m Execute all the parts of the program (default)\n\n     \
  \   \e[1mcomparison\e[0m\n            Run the motif comparison step. The input set\
  \ of motifs are\n            compared against themselves. The output is the pairwise\n\
  \            comparison between the input motifs and a description table\n     \
  \       showing the main features of each motif (name, id, consensus,\n        \
  \    width).\n\n        \e[1mclustering\e[0m\n            Skip the matrix comparison\
  \ step and only executes the clustering\n            step.\n\n            Assumes\
  \ the users already have the description table and\n            comparison table\
  \ exported from the program \e[33mcompare-matrices\e[0m.\n\n            This option\
  \ is ideal to saving time once all comparison beteen\n            the input motifs\
  \ had been done.\n\n    \e[1m-label_in_tree\e[0m\n        Option to select the labels\
  \ displayed in the logo tree.\n\n        \e[1mSupported labels\e[0m\n\n        \

  \n    \e[1m-quick\e[0m\n        With this option the motif comparison is done with\
  \ the program\n        \e[33mcompare-matrices-quick\e[0m (implemented in C) rather\
  \ than the program\n        compare-matrices (implemented in Perl). The quick version\
  \ runs x100\n        times faster, but has not all implemented options as in the\
  \ Perl\n        version.\n\n        We suggest use this option for a big set of\
  \ input motifs > 300\n        motifs.\n\n        \e[1mNOTE:\e[0m By the moment the\

  \ If more than one\n        collections of motifs are provided, they are exported\
  \ in a single\n        file.\n\n        NOTE: take into account the input file size\n\
  \n    \e[1m-rand\e[0m\n        When this option is selected, the columns of the\
  \ input motifs are\n        randomly permuted (conserving thus the Information Content),\
  \ the new\n        motifs are used as input for the pairwise-comparison and clustering.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-heatmap_color_palette Color_Palette\e[0m\n        Select the color palette\
  \ used in the heatmaps (sequential scales)\n        The color palettes (and their\

  \ website\n        (http://colorbrewer2.org/)\n\n    \e[1m-max_matrices X\e[0m\n\
  \        This option specifies how many matrices can be clustered in the same\n\
  \        analysis. If there are more matrices than the specified number, the\n \
  \       program restrics the analyses to the first X matrices, and issues a\n  \
  \      warning.\n\n        This parameter can be useful to prevent submission of\
  \ excessive\n        datasets to the Web server, or for running quick tests before\n\
  \        starting the analysis of a large matrix collection.\n\n    \e[1m-hclust_method\e\

  \   Only analyze the first X motifs of the input file. This options is\n       \
  \ convenient for quick testing before starting the full analysis.\n\n        If\
  \ several motif files are specified, the selection of top motifs is\n        performed\
  \ independently for each motif collection (the max number of\n        motifs will\
  \ this be X * the number of input files).\n\n    \e[1m-skip_matrices X\e[0m\n  \
  \      Skip the first X motifs of the input file. This options is\n        convenient\
  \ for testing the program on a subset of the motifs before\n        starting the\

  \n        Once the hierarchical tree is built, this tree is traversed in a\n   \
  \     bottom-up way. On each branch the descendant motifs are evaluated in\n   \
  \     the same way the clustering method selected by the user (average,\n      \
