  \    input_file\n        This should be the main result file generated by 'rsem-run-ebseq',\n\

  \n    fdr_rate\n        The desire false discovery rate (FDR).\n\n    output_file\n\
  \        This file is a subset of the 'input_file'. It only contains the\n     \
  \   genes/transcripts called as differentially expressed (DE). When more\n     \
  \   than 2 conditions exist, DE is defined as not all conditions are\n        equally\

  \ discovery rate and reports\n    differentially expressed genes/transcripts.\n\n\
  EXAMPLES\n    We assume that we have 'GeneMat.results' as input. We want to control\n\
  \    FDR at 0.05 using hard threshold method and name the output file as\n    'GeneMat.de.txt':\n\
  \n     rsem-control-fdr GeneMat.results 0.05 GeneMat.de.txt\n\n"
