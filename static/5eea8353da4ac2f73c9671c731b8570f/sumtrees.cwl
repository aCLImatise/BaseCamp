- id: tax_on_names_file_path
  doc: Path to file listing all the taxon names or labels that will be found across
    the entire set of source trees. This file should be a plain text file with a single
    name list on each line. This file is only read when multiprocessing ('-M' or '-m')
    is requested. When multiprocessing using the '-M' or '-m' options, all taxon names
    need to be defined in advance of any actual tree analysis. By default this is
    done by reading the first tree in the first tree source and extracting the taxon
    names. At best, this is, inefficient, as it involves an extraneous reading of
    the tree. At worst, this can be errorneous, if the first tree does not contain
    all the taxa. Explicitly providing the taxon names via this option can avoid these
    issues.
