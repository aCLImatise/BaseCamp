  \n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    Rebuild a given position-specific scoring matrix based\
  \ on a set of sites\n    (instances of the motif) found by scaning a given sequence\
  \ set with the\n    input matrix.\n\n    The process can be iterated for a specified\
  \ number of cycles (option\n    -iterations) of site detection <-> matrix building.\
  \ The process stops at\n    convergence, i.e. as soon as an iteration returns a\
  \ matrix identical as\n    the previous one.\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n    Jacques.van-Helden\\\

  \ files might be exported depending on the options\n        (-return sites, -return\
  \ all_matrices). In such case, the basename of\n        the main output file is\
