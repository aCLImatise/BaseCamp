  description: 0,1, or 2  Weight profile for positions on the sequence (see documentation).
    0 - no weight (uniform spatial prior), 1 or 2 - small or zero weights for the
    ends and large weights for the center (e.g. the center 50 bp) (1 - gaussian prior,
    2 - triangular prior). If you expect strong central enrichment for motifs (as
    in ChIP-seq) and your sequences are long (e.g. >100 bp), choose type 1 (default).

  description: 'decimal    ln(E-value) cutoff for selecting MOTIFS (default: 0.0).
    If a seeded analysis fails to identify the expected motif, run GADEM with -verbose
    1 to show motif ln(E-value)s on screen, then re-run with a larger ln(E-value)
    cutoff. This can help in identifying short and/or low abundance motifs, for which
    the default log(E-value) threshold may be too low. A larger value (e.g., 10000)
    can return groups of closely related motifs (possible  variants) whereas a smaller
    value (<0) returns fewer (but conserved) motifs. To identify potential motif variants,
    set -ev large, e.g., 10000 and -minN small e.g., numSeq/10. This allows gadem
    to identify motif variants that are present in at least 10 percent of the sequences.
    A large log(E-value) cutoff enures such motifs are found. The subroutine for E-value
    calculation is adapted from the MEME package.'

  description: "decimal    P-value cutoff for declaring BINDING SITES (default: 0.00025).\
    \ Depending on data size and the motif, you might want to assess more than one\
    \ value. For ChIP-seq data (e.g., 10 thousand +/-200-bp max-center peak 'cores'),\
    \ p=0.00025 often seems appropriate.  Given a subsequence s of length w, GADEM\
    \ computes the log likelihood (llr) score, log{p(s|M)/p(s|B)}, where M is the\
    \ EM-derived motif model, B is the 0-th order Markov background model and w is\
    \ the motif length. GADEM uses the [a,c,g,t] frequencies from the foreground data\
    \ as the parameters for the 0th Makrov background model. The subsequence is declared\
    \ a binding site if  its llr score is at or above the llr score corresponding\
    \ to the p-value cutoff. This requires knowing the distribution of the llr score\
    \ (under the null), and GADEM first integerizes the log(Mij/Bj) llr score matrix,\
    \ where i=1,...,w and j=1,2,3,4, by multiplying it with a large constant (200)\
    \ followed by rounding the real numbers to their closest integers. The null distribution\
    \ of the integerized llr scores is then determined using the Staden probability\
    \ generating function method (Comput. Appl. Biosci,5,89,1989). See Hertz,GZ &\
    \ Stormo GD (Bioinformatics 1999, 15:563-577) for a review."

  description: "string     File name for the seed PWM, when a 'seeded' approach is\
