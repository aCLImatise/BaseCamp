    description: Please choose which type of reference you want to map the samples
      to. "alignment-consensus" will create a consensus sequence for each alignment
      file which will be used as a reference for all samples. This is recommendable
      when all samples are rather closely related to each other. "sample-specific"
      will extract the sample specific sequences from an alignment and use these as
      a separate reference for each individual sample. "user-ref-lib" enables to input
      one single fasta file created by the user which will be used as a reference
      library for all samples.

      one single fasta file that contains a user-prepared reference library which
      will be applied to all samples.
