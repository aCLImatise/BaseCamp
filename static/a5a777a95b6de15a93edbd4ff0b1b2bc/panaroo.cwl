- id: clean_mode
  doc: "The stringency mode at which to run panaroo. Must be one of 'strict','moderate'\
    \ or 'sensitive'. Each of these modes can be fine tuned using the additional parameters\
    \ in the 'Graph correction' section. strict: Requires fairly strong evidence (present\
    \ in  at least 5% of genomes) to keep likely contaminant genes. Will remove genes\
    \ that are refound more often than they were called originally. moderate: Requires\
    \ moderate evidence (present in  at least 1% of genomes) to keep likely contaminant\
    \ genes. Keeps genes that are refound more often than they were called originally.\
    \ sensitive: Does not delete any genes and only performes merge and refinding\
    \ operations. Useful if rare plasmids are of interest as these are often hard\
    \ to disguish from contamination. Results will likely include  higher number of\
    \ spurious annotations."
