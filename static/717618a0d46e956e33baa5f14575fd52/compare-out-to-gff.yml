  description: 'Determines how the overlap calculation is done. If this is not specified,
    the overlap is calculated by bases: if 40 bases of a repeat element overlaps a
    feature in one of the GFF files, it is counted as 40 bases. The sum is taken over
    all features and all repeats of a given type and divided by the total length of
    the repeat. If --instances is specified, the "overlap" is considered to be the
    number of instances of a given type that overlap any feature, divided by the total
    number of instances of that type.'
