help_text: "Set of tools for operating on SAM/BAM files.\nVersion: 1.0.14; Built:\
  \ Mon Jul  2 11:06:18 UTC 2018 by root\n\nTools to Rewrite SAM/BAM Files: \n convert\
  \ - Convert SAM/BAM to SAM/BAM\n writeRegion - Write a file with reads in the specified\
  \ region and/or have the specified read name\n splitChromosome - Split BAM by Chromosome\n\
  \ splitBam - Split a BAM file into multiple BAM files based on ReadGroup\n findCigars\
  \ - Output just the reads that contain any of the specified CIGAR operations.\n\n\
  Tools to Modify & write SAM/BAM Files: \n clipOverlap - Clip overlapping read pairs\
  \ in a SAM/BAM File already sorted by Coordinate or ReadName\n filter - Filter reads\
  \ by clipping ends with too high of a mismatch percentage and by marking reads unmapped\
  \ if the quality of mismatches is too high\n revert - Revert SAM/BAM replacing the\
  \ specified fields with their previous values (if known) and removes specified tags\n\
  \ squeeze -  reduces files size by dropping OQ fields, duplicates, & specified tags,\
  \ using '=' when a base matches the reference, binning quality scores, and replacing\
  \ readNames with unique integers\n trimBam - Trim the ends of reads in a SAM/BAM\
  \ file changing read ends to 'N' and quality to '!' or softclipping the ends (resulting\
  \ file will not be sorted)\n mergeBam - merge multiple BAMs and headers appending\
  \ ReadGroupIDs if necessary\n polishBam - adds/updates header lines & adds the RG\
  \ tag to each record\n dedup - Mark Duplicates\n dedup_LowMem - Mark Duplicates\
  \ using only a little memory\n recab - Recalibrate\n\nInformational Tools\n validate\
  \ - Validate a SAM/BAM File\n diff - Diff 2 coordinate sorted SAM/BAM files.\n stats\
  \ - Stats a SAM/BAM File\n gapInfo - Print information on the gap between read pairs\
  \ in a SAM/BAM File.\n\nTools to Print Information In Readable Format\n dumpHeader\
  \ - Print SAM/BAM Header\n dumpRefInfo - Print SAM/BAM Reference Name Information\n\
  \ dumpIndex - Print BAM Index File in English\n readReference - Print the reference\
  \ string for the specified region\n explainFlags - Describe flags\n\nAdditional\
  \ Tools\n bam2FastQ - Convert the specified BAM file to fastQs.\n\nDummy/Example\
  \ Tools\n readIndexedBam - Read Indexed BAM By Reference and write it from reference\
  \ id -1 to maxRefId\n\nUsage: \n\tbam <tool> [<tool arguments>]\nThe usage for each\
  \ tool is described by specifying the tool with no arguments.\n"
