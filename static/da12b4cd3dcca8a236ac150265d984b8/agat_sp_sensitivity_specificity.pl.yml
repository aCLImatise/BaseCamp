  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_sensitivity_specificity.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ aims to compute the Sensitivity and Specificity in order to\n    assess the quality\
  \ of an annotation according to a reference (that is\n    supposed to be true high-quality\
  \ annotation). The Sensitivity (Sn) is\n    the proportion of true predictions compared\
  \ to the total number of\n    correct genes (including missed predictions) Sn =\
  \ TP / TP+FN The\n    Specificity (Sp) is the proportion of true predictions among\
  \ all\n    predicted genes (including incorrectly predicted ones) Sp = TP / TP+FP\n\
  \n    reference annotation: ------------- prediction : ------------ FN TP FP\n \
  \   TN\n\n    Sensitivity and Specificity will be computed for each feature types.\n\
  \    (and computed independentaly if part of different Level2 type. i.e.\n    exons\
  \ Sn Sp for tRNA will not be mixed up with the exon Sn Sp of mRNA\n    exons)\n\n\
