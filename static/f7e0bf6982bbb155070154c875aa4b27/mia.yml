  \ short read assemblies.\n\nCopyright Richard E. Green, Michael Siebauer 2008-2009\n\
  Report bugs to <green@eva.mpg.de>.\n===============================+++++++++++++==\n\
  \nUsage:\nmia -r <reference sequence>\n    -f <fasta or fastq file of fragments\
  \ to align>\n    -s <substitution matrix file> (if not supplied an default matrix\
  \ is used)\n    -m <root file name for maln output file(s)> (assembly.maln.iter)\n\

  \ based on sum of q-scores\n    -C<tolerance> collapse sequences with same start,\

  \ and value: e.g. -C3\n    -A use adapter presence and coordinate information to\
  \ more aggressively\n       remove repeat sequences - suitable only for 454 sequences\
  \ that have not\n       already been adapter trimmed\n    -T fasta database has\
  \ adapters, trim these\n    -a <adapter sequence or code>\n    -k <use kmer filter\
  \ with kmers of this length>\n    -I <filename of list of sequence IDs to use, ignoring\
  \ all others>\n    \nALIGNMENT parameters:\n    -p <consensus calling code; default\
  \ = 1>\n    -c means reference/assembly is circular\n    -i iterate assembly until\
  \ convergence (default)\n    -n do not iterate assembly until convergence\n    -F\
  \ <only output the FINAL assembly, not each iteration>\n    -D <distantly related\

  \ <use lower-case soft-masking of kmers>\n    -H <do not do dynamic score cutoff,\
  \ instead use this Hard score cutoff>\n    -S <slope of length/score cutoff line>\n\
  \    -N <intercept of length/score cutoff line>\nThe default substitution matrix\
  \ used the following parameters:\n  MATCH=200, MISMATCH=-600, N=-100 for all positions\n\
  The procedure for removing bad-scoring alignments from the assembly is:\nDefault:\
  \ fit a line to length versus score and remove reads that are\nless that SCORE_CUTOFF_BUFFER\
  \ than the average score for its length.\nIf -H is specified then this hard score\
  \ cutoff is applied to all reads.\nThis is preferable if all reads are the same\
  \ length.\nIf -S or -N are specified, then these are used as the slope and intercept\n\
  of a length/score line. Reads must score above this line to be included.\nIf only\
  \ one of -S or -N is specified then the default values are used for\nthe other (default\
  \ S = 200.0; default N = 0.0)\nThe kmer filter requires that a sequence fragment\
  \ have at least one\nkmer of the specified length in common with the reference sequence\
  \ in\norder to align it. For 36nt Solexa data, a value of 12 works well.\nThe -p\
  \ option specifies how the new consensus assembly sequence is called\nat each iteration:\n\
  1 => Any base whose aggregate score is MIN_SC_DIFF_CONS better than all\n      others\
  \ is the assembly base. If none is, then N is the assembly base.\n2 => The best\
  \ scoring base whose aggregate score is better than MIN_SCORE_CONS\n     is the\
  \ assembly base. If none is, then N is the assembly base.\nIf -T is specified, mia\
  \ will attempt to find and trim adapters on\neach sequence. The adapter sequence\
  \ itself can be specified by a\none letter code as argument to -a. N or n => Neandertal\
  \ adapter\n                  any other single letter => Standard GS FLX adapter\n\
  \              sequence (less than 127 nt) => user-specified adapter\n"
