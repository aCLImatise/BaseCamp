help_text: "\nCreate an OrthoMCL compliant .fasta file, by adjusting definition lines.\n\
  \nUsage:\n  orthomclAdjustFasta taxon_code fasta_file id_field\n\nwhere:\n  taxon_code:\
  \  a three or four letter unique abbreviation for the taxon\n  fasta_file:  the\
  \ input fasta file\n  id_field:    a number indicating what field in the definition\
  \ line contains\n               the protein ID.  Fields are separated by either\
  \ ' ' or '|'. Any\n               spaces immediately following the '>' are ignored.\
  \  The first\n               field is 1. For example, in the following definition\
  \ line, the\n               ID (AP_000668.1) is in field 4:  >gi|89106888|ref|AP_000668.1|\n\
  \nInput file requirements:\n  (1) .fasta format\n  (2) a unique id is provided for\
  \ each sequence, and is in the field specified\n      by id_field\n\nOutput file\
  \ format:\n  (1) .fasta format\n  (2) definition line is of the form:\n        \
  \ >taxoncode|unique_protein_id\n\nThe output file is named taxoncode.fasta\n\nNote:\
  \ if your input files do not meet the requirements, you can do some simple perl\
  \ or awk processing of them to create the required input files to this program,\
  \ or the required output files.  This program is provided as a convenience, but\
  \ OrthoMCL users are expected to have the scripting skills to provide OrthoMCL compliant\
  \ .fasta files.\n\nEXAMPLE: orthomclSoftware/bin/orthomclAdjustFasta hsa Homo_sapiens.NCBI36.53.pep.all.fa\
  \ 1\n\n"
