help_text: "isPcr - Standalone v 33x2 In-Situ PCR Program\nusage:\n   isPcr database\
  \ query output\nwhere database is a fasta, nib, or twoBit file or a text file containing\n\
  a list of these files,  query is a text file file containing three columns: name,\n\
  forward primer, and reverse primer,  and output is where the results go.\nThe names\
  \ 'stdin' and 'stdout' can be used as file names to make using the\nprogram in pipes\
  \ easier.\noptions:\n   -ooc=N.ooc  Use overused tile file N.ooc.  N should correspond\
  \ to \n               the tileSize\n   -tileSize=N the size of match that triggers\
  \ an alignment.  \n               Default is 11 .\n   -stepSize=N spacing between\
  \ tiles. Default is 5.\n   -maxSize=N - Maximum size of PCR product (default 4000)\n\
  \   -minSize=N - Minimum size of PCR product (default 0)\n   -minPerfect=N - Minimum\
  \ size of perfect match at 3' end of primer (default 15)\n   -minGood=N - Minimum\
  \ size where there must be 2 matches for each mismatch (default 15)\n   -mask=type\
  \  Mask out repeats.  Alignments won't be started in masked region\n           \
  \    but may extend through it in nucleotide searches.  Masked areas\n         \
  \      are ignored entirely in protein or translated searches. Types are\n     \
  \            lower - mask out lower cased sequence\n                 upper - mask\
  \ out upper cased sequence\n                 out   - mask according to database.out\
  \ RepeatMasker .out file\n                 file.out - mask database according to\
  \ RepeatMasker file.out\n   -makeOoc=N.ooc Make overused tile file. Database needs\
  \ to be complete genome.\n   -repMatch=N sets the number of repetitions of a tile\
  \ allowed before\n               it is marked as overused.  Typically this is 256\
  \ for tileSize\n               12, 1024 for tile size 11, 4096 for tile size 10.\n\
  \               Default is 1024.  Only comes into play with makeOoc\n   -flipReverse\
  \ Reverse complement reverse (second) primer before using\n   -out=XXX - Output\
  \ format.  Either\n      fa - fasta with position, primers in header (default)\n\
  \      bed - tab delimited format. Fields: chrom/start/end/name/score/strand\n \
  \     psl - blat format.\n\n"
