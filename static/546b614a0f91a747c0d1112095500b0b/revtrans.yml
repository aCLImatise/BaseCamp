  description: 'By default the very first codon in each sequences is assumed to be
    the initial codon on the transcript. This means certain non-methionine codons
    actually codes for metionine at this  position. For example "TTG" in the standard
    genetic code (see above). Selecting this option treats all codons as internal
    codons.     '

  description: 'Allow the translation to continue after a stop codon is reached. The
    stop codon will be marked as "*". Be careful that stop codons have been addressed

  description: 'Specify how to match the corresponding DNA and peptide  sequences.
    Valid methods are: trans (default), name and pos. Please note that both DNA and
    peptide sequence should have  unique names, regardless of the matching method.  trans:
    Match sequences by translation. The DNA sequences are translated using the standard
    genetic code (default) or an alternative translation matrix if the -mtx option
    is used. name: Match sequences by name. Please note that for FASTA  files everything
    after the ">" is considered the sequence name.  pos: Match by position. The sequence
    are matched by position in the files (first DNA sequence with first peptide sequence
    etc.).                 '

    -v:   verbose level 1 Info about files, number of sequences read etc. Use this
    as the first try if something needs investigation. -vv:  verbose level 2 As level
    1 +  Print detailed info about all the sequence names. -vvv: verbose level 3 As
    level 2 + Do a sanity check on the degapped length of the sequences. Warn if the
    sizes do not match.'
