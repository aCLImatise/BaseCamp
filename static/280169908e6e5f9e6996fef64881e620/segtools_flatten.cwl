- id: mnemonic_file
  doc: Save mapping information to FILE instead of flat.mnemonics (default). This
    file complies with the mnemonic file format.

- id: filter
  doc: Don't output new segment labels (and corresponding segments) that span less
    than F*N bases, where N is the number of bases covered by the new segmentation.
    This can be used to remove extremely uncommon labels (e.g. F = 0.01) that are
    the more likely to be spurious. Filtering is off by default.
