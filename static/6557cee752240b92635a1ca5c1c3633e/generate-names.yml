help_text: "\e[1mNAME\e[0m\n    generate-names.pl - build a global index of feature\
  \ names. By default,\n    rebuilds the entire index from scratch at each run.\n\n\
  \e[1mUSAGE\e[0m\n      generate-names.pl                        \\\n          [\
  \ --out <output directory> ]         \\\n          [ --verbose ]\n\n\e[1mOPTIONS\e\
  [0m\n    --out <directory>\n        Data directory to process. Default 'data/'.\n\
  \n    --tracks <trackname>[,...]\n        Comma-separated list of which tracks to\
  \ include in the names index. If\n        not passed, all tracks are indexed.\n\n\
  \    --compress\n        If passed, gzip the JSON files in the index, naming them\
  \ *.jsonz\n        instead of *.json. Like the --compress option for flatfile-to-json.pl\n\
  \        and prepare-refseqs.pl, if you use this option you must configure your\n\
  \        web server to serve these files with the correct Content-Encoding HTTP\n\
  \        header. See the JBrowse Configuration Guide on the GMOD wiki for help\n\
  \        with this.\n\n    --incremental | -i\n        Do not completely rebuild\
  \ the names index in the given location, only\n        insert new names into it.\n\
  \n    --locationLimit <number>\n        Maximum number of distinct locations to\
  \ store for a single name.\n        Default 100.\n\n    --mem <bytes>\n        Number\
  \ of bytes of RAM we are allowed to use for caching memory.\n        Default 256000000\
  \ (256 MiB). If your machine has enough RAM,\n        increasing this can speed\
  \ up this script's running time significantly.\n\n    --workdir <dir>\n        Use\
  \ the given location for building the names index, copying the index\n        over\
  \ to the destination location when fully built. By default, builds\n        the\
  \ index in the output location.\n\n        Name indexing is a very I/O intensive\
  \ operation, because the\n        filesystem is used to store intermediate results\
  \ in order to keep the\n        RAM usage reasonable. If a fast filesystem (e.g.\
  \ tmpfs) is available\n        and large enough, indexing can be speeded up by using\
  \ it to store the\n        intermediate results of name indexing.\n\n    --completionLimit\
  \ <number>\n        Maximum number of name completions to store for a given prefix.\n\
  \        Default 20. Set to 0 to disable auto-completion of feature names. Note\n\
  \        that the name index always contains exact matches for feature names;\n\
  \        this setting only disables autocompletion based on incomplete names.\n\n\
  \    --verbose\n        Print more progress messages.\n\n    --help | -h | -?\n\
  \        Print a usage message.\n\n"
