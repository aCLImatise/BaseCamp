  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_fix_overlaping_genes.pl\n\nDescription:\n    Check a gtf/gff\
  \ annotation file to find cases where differents gene\n    features have CDS that\
  \ overlap. In this case the gene features will be\n    merged in only one. One gene\
  \ is choosen as reference, and the mRNA from\n    the other gene will be linked\
  \ to it. So, it creates isoforms.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_fix_overlaping_genes.pl\
