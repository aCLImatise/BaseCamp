  description: 'For use only with -byTarget. Instead of auto-incrementing an integer
    or requiring a unique number in the sequence name, use a hash function on the
    sequence name to compute an N-bit number.  This limits the max #filenames to 2^N
    and ensures that even if different subsets of sequences appear in different pairwise
    mafs, the split file names will be consistent (due to hash function). This option
    is useful when a "scaffold-based" assembly has more than one sequence name pattern,
    e.g. both chroms and scaffolds.'
