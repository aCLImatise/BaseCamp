help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 17, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Filters a sam file to remove reads with variations unsupported\nby other reads\
  \ (bad vars, aka bad subs).  For particularly bad data,\nit may be advisable to\
  \ iteratively re-call variants and re-run FilterSam.\nCalling variants may be performed\
  \ like this:\n\ncallvariants.sh in=mapped.sam ref=ref.fa out=vars.vcf clearfilters\
  \ minreads=2\n\nUsage:  filtersam.sh in=<file> out=<file> vcf=<file>\n\nParameters:\n\
  in=<file>       Input sam or bam file.\nref=<file>      Optional fasta reference\
  \ file.\nout=<file>      Output file for good reads.\noutb=<file>     Output file\
  \ for bad reads.\nvcf=<file>      VCF file of variants called from these reads.\n\
  vars=<file>     Alternatively, variants can be provided in CallVariants'\n     \
  \           native output format.\nmbv=2           (maxbadvars) Discarded reads\
  \ with more bad vars than this.\nmbad=2          (maxbadalleledepth) A var is bad\
  \ if the allele depth is at\n                most this much.\nmbaf=0.01       (maxbadalleledepth)\
  \ A var is bad if the allele fraction is at\n                most this much.  The\
  \ more stringent of mbad or mbaf is used,\n                so in low depth regions\
  \ mbad is dominant while in high depth \n                regions mbaf is more important.\
  \  Vars are considered bad if\n                they fail either threshold (meaning\
  \ ad<=mbad or af<=mbaf).\nmbrd=2          (minbadreaddepth) Substitutions may only\
  \ be considered\n                bad if the total read depth spanning the variant\
  \ is\n                at least this much.\nborder=5        (minenddist) Ignore vars\
  \ within this distance of read ends.\nsub=t           Consider bad substitutions.\n\
  ins=f           Consider bad insertions.\ndel=f           Consider bad deletions.\n\
  \nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\
