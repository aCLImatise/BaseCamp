help_text: "NAME\n  mb - Make buckets\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n  gsutil mb [-c class] [-l\
  \ location] [-p proj_id] url...\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The mb command creates a new\
  \ bucket. Google Cloud Storage has a single\n  namespace, so you are not allowed\
  \ to create a bucket with a name already\n  in use by another user. You can, however,\
  \ carve out parts of the bucket name\n  space corresponding to your company's domain\
  \ name (see \"gsutil help naming\").\n\n  If you don't specify a project ID using\
  \ the -p option, the bucket is created\n  using the default project ID specified\
  \ in your gsutil configuration file\n  (see \"gsutil help config\"). For more details\
  \ about projects see \"gsutil help\n  projects\".\n\n  The -c and -l options specify\
  \ the storage class and location, respectively,\n  for the bucket. Once a bucket\
  \ is created in a given location and with a\n  given storage class, it cannot be\
  \ moved to a different location, and the\n  storage class cannot be changed. Instead,\
  \ you would need to create a new\n  bucket and move the data over and then delete\
  \ the original bucket.\n\n\nBUCKET STORAGE CLASSES\n  You can specify one of the\
  \ `storage classes\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes>`_\
  \ for a bucket\n  with the -c option.\n\n  Example:\n\n    gsutil mb -c nearline\
  \ gs://some-bucket\n\n  See online documentation for\n  `pricing <https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing>`_\
  \ and\n  `SLA <https://cloud.google.com/storage/sla>`_ details.\n\n  If you don't\
  \ specify a -c option, the bucket is created with the\n  default storage class Standard\
  \ Storage, which is equivalent to Multi-Regional\n  Storage or Regional Storage,\
  \ depending on whether the bucket was created in\n  a multi-regional location or\
  \ regional location, respectively.\n\nBUCKET LOCATIONS\n  You can specify one of\
  \ the 'available locations\n  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-locations>`_\
  \ for a bucket\n  with the -l option.\n\n  Examples:\n\n    gsutil mb -l asia gs://some-bucket\n\
  \n    gsutil mb -c regional -l us-east1 gs://some-bucket\n\n  If you don't specify\
  \ a -l option, the bucket is created in the default\n  location (US).\n\nOPTIONS\n\
  \  -c class          Specifies the default storage class. Default is \"Standard\"\
  .\n\n  -l location       Can be any multi-regional or regional location. See\n \
  \                   https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes\n    \
  \                for a discussion of this distinction. Default is US.\n        \
  \            Locations are case insensitive.\n\n  -p proj_id        Specifies the\
  \ project ID under which to create the bucket.\n\n  -s class          Same as -c.\n"
