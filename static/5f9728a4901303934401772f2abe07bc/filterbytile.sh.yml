help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified October 30, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Filters reads based on positional quality over a flowcell.\nQuality is estimated\
  \ based on quality scores and kmer uniqueness.\nAll reads within a small unit of\
  \ area called a micro-tile are averaged,\nthen the micro-tile is either retained\
  \ or discarded as a unit.\nPlease read bbmap/docs/guides/FilterByTileGuide.txt for\
  \ more information.\n\nUsage:\tfilterbytile.sh in=<input> out=<output>\n\nInput\
  \ parameters:\nin=<file>           Primary input file.\nin2=<file>          Second\
  \ input file for paired reads in two files.\nindump=<file>       Specify an already-made\
  \ dump file to use instead of\n                    analyzing the input reads.\n\
  reads=-1            Process this number of reads, then quit (-1 means all).\ninterleaved=auto\
  \    Set true/false to override autodetection of the\n                    input\
  \ file as paired interleaved.\nseed=-1             Set to a positive numver for\
  \ deterministic output.\n\nOutput parameters:\nout=<file>          Output file for\
  \ filtered reads.\ndump=<file>         Write a summary of quality information by\
  \ coordinates.\n\nTile parameters:\nxsize=500           Initial width of micro-tiles.\n\
  ysize=500           Initial height of micro-tiles.\nsize=               Allows setting\
  \ xsize and ysize tot he same value.\ntarget=800          Iteratively increase the\
  \ size of micro-tiles until they\n                    contain an average of at least\
  \ this number of reads.\n\nA micro-tile is discarded if any of 3 metrics indicate\
  \ a problem.\nThe metrics are kmer uniqueness (u), average quality (q), and probability\n\
  of being error-free (e).  Each has 3 parameters: deviations (d),\nfraction (f),\
  \ and absolute (a).  After calculating the difference (delta)\nbetween a micro-tile\
  \ and average, it is discarded only if all three of these\nconditions are true for\
  \ at least one metric (using quality as the example):\n1) delta is greater than\
  \ (qd) standard deviations.\n2) delta is greater than average times the fraction\
  \ (qf).\n3) delta is greater than the absolute value (qa).\n\nFiltering parameters:\n\
  udeviations=1.5     (ud) Standard deviations for uniqueness discarding.\nqdeviations=2\
  \       (qd) Standard deviations for quality discarding.\nedeviations=2       (ed)\
  \ Standard deviations for error-free probablity \n                    discarding.\n\
  ufraction=0.01      (uf) Min fraction for uniqueness discarding.\nqfraction=0.01\
  \      (qf) Min fraction for quality discarding.\nefraction=0.01      (ef) Min fraction\
  \ for error-free probablity discarding.\nuabsolute=1         (ua) Min absolute value\
  \ for uniqueness discarding.\nqabsolute=1         (qa) Min absolute value for quality\
  \ discarding.\neabsolute=1         (ea) Min absolute value for error-free probablity\
  \ discarding.\n\nOther parameters:\nlowqualityonly=t    (lqo) Only filter low quality\
  \ reads within low quality \n                    micro-tiles, rather than the whole\
  \ micro-tile.\ntrimq=-1            If set to a positive number, trim reads to that\
  \ quality\n                    level instead of filtering them.\nqtrim=r       \
  \      If trimq is positive, to quality trimming on this end\n                 \
  \   of the reads.  Values are r, l, and rl for right,\n                    left,\
  \ and both ends.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx                This will set Java's memory\
  \ usage, overriding autodetection.\n                    -Xmx20g will specify 20\
  \ GB of RAM; -Xmx200m will specify \n                    200 MB.  The max is typically\
  \ 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom               This flag will cause the process\
  \ to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java\
  \ 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
