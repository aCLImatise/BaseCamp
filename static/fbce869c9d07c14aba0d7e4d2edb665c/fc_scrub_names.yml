  \nDescription:\n\nThis code removes \"|arrow\" from the sequence names and creats\
  \ the name \nmapping file for the snakemake pipeline. FALCON-Phase expects the p-contig\
  \ \nnames start with *.F and the h-contigs names follow the *.F_[0-9]+ convention.\
  \ \n\nIf you've modified your contig names in any way this script will run, but\n\
  the output will not work with the pipeline.\n\n"
