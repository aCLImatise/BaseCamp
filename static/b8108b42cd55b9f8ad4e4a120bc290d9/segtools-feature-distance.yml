  description: Strand correct features in the ANNOTATION file. If the feature contains
    strand information, the sign of the distance value is used to portray the relationship
    between the segment and the nearest stranded feature. A negative distance value
    indicates that the segment is nearest the 5' end of the feature, whereas a positive
    value indicates the segment is nearest the 3' end of the feature.

  description: The name of the nearest feature will be printed after each distance
    (with a space separating the two) for features from the ANNOTATION file. If multiple
    features are equally near (or overlap), it is undefined which will be printed

- !Flag
  description: If multiple features in the ANNOTATION file overlap a segment, a separate
    line is printed for each overlapping segment-feature pair. This is most interesting
    with --print-nearest. Otherwise, the first overlapping segment will be used for
    printing.

  description: Number of bins to use in histogram for distances greater than zero
    and less than or equal to N*W. Distances of 0 and greater than N*W are placed
    in additional bins. If --stranded, N more bins are included in the negative direction
    and a bin for distances less than -N*W.

  description: Number of bases in each bin. If --stranded, bins cover distances of
    (-Inf,-N*W), ..., [-W,0), [0], (0,W], ..., (N*W,Inf). Otherwise, the bins cover
    distances of [0], (0,W], (W,2W], ..., (N*W,Inf).
