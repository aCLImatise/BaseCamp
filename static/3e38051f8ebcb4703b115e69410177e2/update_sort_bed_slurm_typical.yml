  \n  The \"update-sort-bed-slurm\" utility applies an updated sort order on BED \n\
  \  files sorted per pre-v2.4.20 sort-bed, using a SLURM job scheduler to \n  coordinate\
  \ resorting each chromosome in \"--input-original\" per post-v2.4.20 \n  sort-bed\
  \ and writing the result to \"--output-final\". \n\n  When migration is finished,\
  \ \"--input-backup\" specifies the new name of the \n  original input.\n\n  As migration\
  \ progresses, intermediate results are written to \"--output-temp\"\n  and then\
  \ written to \"--output-final\" upon completion.\n\n  Each sort task is given 8\
  \ GB of memory and is assigned to the \"queue0\" \n  partition, unless the \"--slurm-memory\"\
  \ and \"--slurm-partition\" options are \n  set. If your input is larger than 8\
  \ GB, you will need to allocate more \n  memory.\n\n  Because this launches all\
  \ work on the specified cluster partition, the paths\n  specified by \"--input-original\"\
  , \"--input-backup\", \"--output-final\", and \n  \"--output-temp\" must be accessible\
  \ to all computational nodes. For example, \n  using /tmp may fail, as the /tmp\
  \ path is almost certainly unique to a node; \n  it is necesssary to use a path\
  \ shared among all nodes.\n\n  Note that this utility will not work on entirely\
  \ unsorted BED files, but only \n  on files with a sort order from pre-v2.4.20 sort-bed,\
  \ where there are ties on \n  the first three columns. \n\n  In fact, until further\
  \ refinements are made, this convenience utility could \n  fail silently on inputs\
  \ which are not BED, or which are not sorted per pre-\n  v2.4.20 order, or which\
  \ do not follow exact specification, all of which can \n  lead a per-chromosome\
  \ resort task to fail.\n"
