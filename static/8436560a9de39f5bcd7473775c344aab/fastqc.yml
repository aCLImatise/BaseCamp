  \ [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam] \n           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1\
  \ .. seqfileN\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n    FastQC reads a set of sequence files and produces\
  \ from each one a quality\n    control report consisting of a number of different\
  \ modules, each one of \n    which will help to identify a different potential type\
  \ of problem in your\n    data.\n    \n    If no files to process are specified\
  \ on the command line then the program\n    will start as an interactive graphical\
  \ application.  If files are provided\n    on the command line then the program\
  \ will run with no user interaction\n    required.  In this mode it is suitable\
  \ for inclusion into a standardised\n    analysis pipeline.\n    \n    The options\
  \ for the program as as follows:\n    \n    -h --help       Print this help file\
  \ and exit\n    \n    -v --version    Print the version of the program and exit\n\
  \    \n    -o --outdir     Create all output files in the specified output directory.\n\
  \                    Please note that this directory must exist as the program\n\
  \                    will not create it.  If this option is not set then the \n\
  \                    output file for each sequence file is created in the same\n\
  \                    directory as the sequence file which was processed.\n     \
  \               \n    --casava        Files come from raw casava output. Files in\
  \ the same sample\n                    group (differing only by the group number)\
  \ will be analysed\n                    as a set rather than individually. Sequences\
  \ with the filter\n                    flag set in the header will be excluded from\

  \ directories and produce\n                    a single output file from the sequences\
  \ found in all files.                    \n                    \n    --nofilter\
  \      If running with --casava then don't remove read flagged by\n            \
  \        casava as poor quality when performing the QC analysis.\n             \
  \      \n    --extract       If set then the zipped output file will be uncompressed\
  \ in\n                    the same directory after it has been created.  By default\n\
  \                    this option will be set if fastqc is run in non-interactive\n\
