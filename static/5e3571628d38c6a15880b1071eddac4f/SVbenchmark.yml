  description: The fasta file that was used as the reference for the two VCF files
    being compared.
  synonyms:
  - --ref
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: path to reference FASTA file
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The file of variants to be compared to the variants in the truth file.
  synonyms:
  - --test
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: path to VCF file of test variants
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The file of variants to which the test variants will be compared.

  - --truth
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: path to VCF file of true variants
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Maximum number of base pairs separating the POS values for two variants
    to be compared. Variants farther than this distance apart will be considered not
    to be matching.
  synonyms:
  - --maxdist
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: maximum distance
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum size of a variant to be included in a benchmarking comparison.
    In calculations of recall/sensitivity, this minimum is applied to the size of
    the "true" variant. In calculations of precision, this minimum is applied to the
    size of the test variant.
  synonyms:
  - --minsize
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: minimum size
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Prefix to be used in the naming of all output files. A directory name
    can be included (e.g., "myresults/sampleA") so long as the directory already exists.
  synonyms:

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: prefix
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: File of regions from which to include variants. Used to filter both
    test and truth variants.
  synonyms:
  - --includebed
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: BED file of regions to include
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: String specifying the value in the test VCF record's "FILTER" field
    in order for a variant to be included in the comparison.
  synonyms:
  - --testfilter
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: filter string
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: String specifying the value in the truth VCF record's "FILTER" field
    in order for a variant to be included in the comparison.
  synonyms:
  - --truthfilter
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: filter string
  optional: true
- !Flag

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: normalized shift value
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Maximum allowable normalized size difference between matching test
    and true variants.
  synonyms:
  - --normsizediff
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: normalized size difference
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Maximum allowable normalized edit distance between matching test and
    true variants.
