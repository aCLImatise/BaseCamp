help_text: "\e[1mNAME\e[0m\n    fu-cat - concatenate FASTA or FASTQ files\n\n\e[1mSYNOPSIS\e\
  [0m\n      fu-cat [options] [FILE1 FILE2 FILE3...]\n\n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n  \
  \  This program parses a list of FASTA/FASTQ and will concatenate them\n    ensuring\
  \ consistent output. Will rename duplicate sequence names. Will try\n    to autodetect\
  \ the format of all files before executing and decide\n    accordingly the output\
  \ format (FASTA if at least one of the files is\n    FASTA, otherwise FASTQ). If\
  \ reading from STDIN the first sequence is in\n    FASTQ format, will skip all the\
  \ sequences without a quality string.\n\n    If no files are provided the program\
  \ will try reading from STDIN,\n    otherwise add a '-' to the list of files to\
  \ also read from STDIN.\n\n\e[1mPARAMETERS\e[0m\n    \e[4m-s\e[0m, \e[4m--separator\e\
  [0m\n        When a second sequence with a name that was already printed is found,\n\
  \        the program will append a progressive number, separated by this\n     \
  \   string. Use `fu-rename` if you need more options. [default: \".\"]\n\n    \e\
  [4m-f\e[0m, \e[4m--fasta\e[0m\n        Force FASTA output\n\n    \e[4m-q\e[0m, \e\
  [4m--fastq\e[0m\n        Force FASTQ output. Will \e[1mnot\e[0m print any sequence\
  \ without quality (they\n        will be skipped)\n\n    \e[4m-l\e[0m, \e[4m--minlen\e\
  [0m INT\n        Do not print sequences shorter (exclusive) than INT\n\n    \e[4m-m\e\
  [0m, \e[4m--maxlen\e[0m INT\n        Do not print sequences longer (exclusive) than\
  \ INT\n\n    \e[4m-u\e[0m, \e[4m--uppercase\e[0m\n        Will print the whole sequence\
  \ in uppercase\n\n    \e[4m-w\e[0m, \e[4m--width\e[0m INT\n        Size of the FASTA\
  \ lines. Specifing 0 will print the whole sequence in\n        the same line (default:\
  \ 0)\n\n    \e[4m--verbose\e[0m\n        Print more details\n\n    \e[4m--help\e\
