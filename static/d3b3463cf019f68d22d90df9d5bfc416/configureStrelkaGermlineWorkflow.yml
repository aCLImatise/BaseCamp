  description: Provide ploidy file in VCF. The VCF should include one sample column
    per input sample labeled with the same sample names found in the input BAM/CRAM
    RG header sections. Ploidy should be provided in records using the FORMAT/CN field,
    which are interpreted to span the range [POS+1, INFO/END]. Any CN value besides
    1 or 0 will be treated as 2. File must be tabix indexed. (no default)

  description: 'Specify a VCF of candidate indel alleles. These alleles are always
    evaluated but only reported in the output when they are inferred to exist in the
    sample. The VCF must be tabix indexed. All indel alleles must be left-shifted/normalized,
    any unnormalized alleles will be ignored. This option may be specified more than
    once, multiple input VCFs will be merged. (default: None)'

  description: 'Specify a VCF of candidate alleles. These alleles are always evaluated
    and reported even if they are unlikely to exist in the sample. The VCF must be
    tabix indexed. All indel alleles must be left- shifted/normalized, any unnormalized
    allele will trigger a runtime error. This option may be specified more than once,
    multiple input VCFs will be merged. Note that for any SNVs provided in the VCF,
    the SNV site will be reported (and for gVCF, excluded from block compression),
    but the specific SNV alleles are ignored. (default: None)'

  description: 'Optionally provide a bgzip-compressed/tabix-indexed BED file containing
    the set of regions to call. No VCF output will be provided outside of these regions.
    The full genome will still be used to estimate statistics from the input (such
