  \n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    Compare the empirical distributioins of weight score\
  \ obtained with\n    different matrices in a given sequence set.\n\n    In order\
  \ to estimate the capability of a PSSM to distinguish bona fide\n    binding sites\
  \ from genome background, we propose a method that relies on\n    the combined analysis\
  \ of theoretical and empirical score distributions\n    in positive and negative\
  \ control sets.\n\n    \e[1mmatrix-quality\e[0m computes the theoretical distribution\
  \ of scores for a\n    PSSM, and compares it to several empirical distributions\
  \ obtained from\n    various sequence sets.\n\n    There might be several PSSMs\
  \ capable to detect similar binding motifs,\n    we can measure their quality independently,\
  \ althougth we would like to\n    detect the one with the best perfromance in orther\
  \ to use only one.\n\n    With the different score distributions obtained with \e\
  [1mmatrix-quality\e[0m it\n    should be possible to compare the detection capability\
  \ of a set of\n    matrices over the same set of sequences.\n\n    This is done\
  \ using the Weight Diference (WD), by default this value is\n    defined as the\
  \ difference between the observed Weigth Score (WS) in all\n    promoters of an\
  \ organism (e.g. Escherichia coli K12) and the expected WS\n    in the theoretical\
  \ distribution of the PSSM for a given P-value (see\n    \e[1mmatrix-distrib\e[0m).\n\
  \n    Information of compared matrices is returned together with the graphic\n \
  \   comparison.\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n    Alejandra Medina-Rivera <amedina@lcg.unam.mx>\n\
