  description: Genome names to 'focus'. You can use this parameter to limit the genomes
    included in your analysis. You can provide these names as a comma-separated list
    of names, or you can put them in a file, where you have a single genome name in
    each line, and provide the file path.

  description: By default, anvi'o attempts to align amino acid sequences in each gene
    cluster using multiple sequnce alignment via muscle. You can use this flag to
    skip that step and be upset later.

  - --skip-alignments
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, anvi'o attempts to calculate homogeneity values for every
    gene cluster, given that they are aligned. You can use this flag to have anvi'o
    skip homogeneity calculations. Anvi'o will ignore this flag if you decide to skip
    alignments
  synonyms:
  - --skip-homogeneity
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, anvi'o will use a homogeneity algorithm that checks for
    horizontal and vertical geometric homogeneity (along with functional). With this
    flag, you can tell anvi'o to skip horizontal geometric homogeneity calculations.
    It will be less accurate but quicker. Anvi'o will ignore this flag if you skip
    homogeneity calculations or alignments all together.
  synonyms:
  - --quick-homogeneity
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true

  description: The multiple sequence alignment program to use when multiple sequence
    alignment is necessary. To see all available options, use the flag `--list-aligners`.

    name: ALIGNER
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, anvi'o includes all partial gene calls from the analysis,
    which, in some cases, may inflate the number of gene clusters identified and introduce
    extra heterogeneity within those gene clusters. Using this flag, you can request
    anvi'o to exclude partial gene calls from the analysis (whether a gene call is
    partial or not is an information that comes directly from the gene caller used
    to identify genes during the generation of the contigs database).
  synonyms:
  - --exclude-partial-gene-calls
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: This program uses DIAMOND by default, however, if you like, you can
    use good ol' blastp from NCBI instead.
  synonyms:
  - --use-ncbi-blast
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The minimum minbit value. The minbit heuristic provides a mean to set
    a to eliminate weak matches between two amino acid sequences. We learned it from
    ITEP (Benedict MN et al, doi:10.1186/1471-2164-15-8), which is a comprehensive
    analysis workflow for pangenomes, and decided to use it in the anvi'o pangenomic
    workflow, as well. Briefly, If you have two amino acid sequences, 'A' and 'B',
    the minbit is defined as 'BITSCORE(A, B) / MIN(BITSCORE(A, A), BITSCORE(B, B))'.
    So the minbit score between two sequences goes to 1 if they are very similar over
    the entire length of the 'shorter' amino acid sequence, and goes to 0 if (1) they
    match over a very short stretch compared even to the length of the shorter amino
    acid sequence or (2) the match betwen sequence identity is low. The default is
    0.5.

  description: Do you not want singletons?\ You don't? Well, this parameter will help
    you get rid of them (along with doubletons, if you want). Anvi'o will remove gene
    clusters that occur less than the number you set using this parameter from the
    analysis. The default is 1, which means everything will be kept. If you want to
    remove singletons, set it to 2, if you want to remove doubletons as well, set
    it to 3, and so on.

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum percent identity between the two amino acid sequences for them
    to have an edge for MCL analysis. This value will be used to filter hits from
    Diamond search results. Because percent identity is not a predictor of a good
    match (since it does not communicate many other important factors such as the
    alignment length between the two sequences and its proportion to the entire length
    of those involved), we suggest you rely on 'minbit' parameter. But you know what?
    Maybe you shouldn't listen to anyone, and experiment on your own! The default
    is 0 percent.

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: PERCENT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: DIAMOND sensitivity. With this flag you can instruct DIAMOND to be
    'sensitive', rather than 'fast' during the search. It is likely the search will
    take remarkably longer. But, hey, if you are doing it for your final analysis,
    maybe it should take longer and be more accurate. This flag is only relevant if
    you are running DIAMOND.

  description: Name of the project. Please choose a short but descriptive name (so
    anvi'o can use it whenever she needs to name an output file, or add a new table
    in a database, or name her first born).

  description: A plain text file that contains some description about the project.

    summary outputs.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: Anvi'o attempts to generate a hierarchical clustering of your gene
    clusters once it identifies them so you can use `anvi-display-pan` to play with
    it. But if you want to skip this step, this is your flag.
  synonyms:

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If you want anvi'o to try to generate a hierarchical clustering of
    your gene clusters even if the number of gene clusters exceeds its suggested limit
    for hierarchical clustering, you can use this flag to enforce it. Are you are
    a rebel of some sorts? Or did computers made you upset? Express your anger towards
    machine using this flag.

  description: The distance metric for the clustering of gene clusters. If you do
