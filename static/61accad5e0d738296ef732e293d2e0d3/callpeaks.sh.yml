help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified December 19, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Calls peaks from a 2-column (x, y) tab-delimited histogram.\n\nUsage:       \
  \ callpeaks.sh in=<histogram file> out=<output file>\n\nPeak-calling parameters:\n\
  in=<file>           'in=stdin.fq' will pipe from standard in.\nout=<file>      \
  \    Write the peaks to this file.  Default is stdout.\nminHeight=2         (h)\
  \ Ignore peaks shorter than this.\nminVolume=5         (v) Ignore peaks with less\
  \ area than this.\nminWidth=3          (w) Ignore peaks narrower than this.\nminPeak=2\
  \           (minp) Ignore peaks with an X-value below this. \n                 \
  \   Useful when low-count kmers are filtered).\nmaxPeak=BIG         (maxp) Ignore\
  \ peaks with an X-value above this.\nmaxPeakCount=10     (maxpc) Print up to this\
  \ many peaks (prioritizing height).\ncountColumn=1       (col) For multi-column\
  \ input, this column, zero-based, \n                    contains the counts.\nploidy=-1\
  \           Specify ploidy; otherwise it will be autodetected.\nlogscale=f     \
  \     Transform to log-scale prior to peak-calling.  Useful\n                  \
  \  for kmer-frequency histograms.\n\nSmoothing parameters:\nsmoothradius=0     \
  \ Integer radius of triangle filter.  Set above zero to \n                    smooth\
  \ data prior to peak-calling.  Higher values are \n                    smoother.\n\
  smoothprogressive=f Set to true to widen the filter as the x-coordinate\n      \
  \              increases.  Useful for kmer-frequency histograms.\nmaxradius=10 \
  \       Maximum radius of progressive smoothing function.\nprogressivemult=2   Increment\
  \ radius each time depth increases by this factor.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
