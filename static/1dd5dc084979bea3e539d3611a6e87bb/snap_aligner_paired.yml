  \ by the\nparameters for the next alignment (including single or paired).  You may\
  \ have as many of these\nas you please.  If two consecutive alignments use the same\
  \ index, it will not be reloaded.\nSo, for example, you could do 'snap-aligner single\
  \ hg19-20 foo.fq -o foo.sam , paired hg19-20 end1.fq end2.fq -o paired.sam'\nand\
  \ it would not reload the index between the single and paired alignments.\nWhen\
  \ specifying an input or output file, you can simply list the filename, in which\
  \ case\nSNAP will infer the type of the file from the file extension (.sam or .bam\
  \ for example),\nor you can explicitly specify the file type by preceding the filename\
  \ with one of the\n following type specifiers (which are case sensitive):\n    -fastq\n\
  \    -compressedFastq\n    -sam\n    -bam\n    -pairedFastq\n    -pairedInterleavedFastq\n\
  \    -pairedCompressedInterleavedFastq\n\nSo, for example, you could specify -bam\
  \ input.file to make SNAP treat input.file as a BAM file,\neven though it would\
  \ ordinarily assume a FASTQ file for input or a SAM file for output when it\ndoesn't\
  \ recoginize the file extension.\nIn order to use a file name that begins with a\
  \ '-' and not have SNAP treat it as a switch, you must\nexplicitly specify the type.\
  \  But really, that's just confusing and you shouldn't do it.\nInput and output\
  \ may also be from/to stdin/stdout. To do that, use a - for the input or output\
  \ file\nname and give an explicit type specifier.  So, for example, \nsnap-aligner\
  \ single myIndex -fastq - -o -sam -\nwould read FASTQ from stdin and write SAM to\
