help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified September 1, 2016\nDescription:\
  \  Shreds sequences into shorter, potentially overlapping sequences.\n\nUsage:\t\
  shred.sh in=<file> out=<file> length=<number> minlength=<number> overlap=<number>\n\
  \nin=<file>       Input sequences.\nout=<file>      Destination of output shreds.\n\
  length=500      Desired length of shreds.\nminlength=1     Shortest allowed shred.\
  \  The last shred of each input sequence may be shorter than desired length.\noverlap=0\
  \       Amount of overlap between successive reads.\nreads=-1        If nonnegative,\
  \ stop after this many input sequences.\nequal=f         Shred each sequence into\
  \ subsequences of equal size of at most 'length', instead of a fixed size.\nmedian=0\
  \        If nonzero, randomly shred reads to a length with this median.\nvariance=0\
  \      If median is nonzero, shred to lengths of median +-variance.\n\nPlease contact\
  \ Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
