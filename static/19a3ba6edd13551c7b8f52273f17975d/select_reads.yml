  \ read messages\n\n. By default, reads are considered independently so you can\n\
  \  print a read, but not its mate. The -N option removes references\n  to unprinted\
  \ mate-pairs in the FRG messages.\n\n. In most cases, you should use -M to automatically\
  \ select mates.\n\nYou must specify included and/or excluded reads. Precedence is:\n\
  1) If a read is excluded by -X or -x, it will not be printed\n  (-M) Mates of excluded\
  \ reads will not be printed either\n\n2) If a read is included by -I or -i, it will\
  \ be printed except if excluded\n  (-M) Mates of included reads will be printed,\
  \ except if either is excluded\n       (Included Reads or mates may be clobbered\
  \ by excluded reads or mates)\n\n3) If no reads are included, all reads except those\
  \ excluded will be printed\n\nExclusion takes precedence over inclusion!\n"
