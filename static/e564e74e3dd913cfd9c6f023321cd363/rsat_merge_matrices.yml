  \n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    This programs takes as input a list of position-specific\
  \ scoring\n    matrices, and merges them by applying a user-selected operator on\
  \ the\n    aligned cell of all matrices.\n\n    Supported operators (option -calc):\
  \ sum, mean, diff.\n\n    The diff operator returns the result of the subtraction\
  \ between the\n    first and the second matrices (if the input file contains more\
  \ than two\n    matrices, a warning message is issued).\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n \

  \ [-v #] [-i inputfile] [-in_format input_format] \\ [-o\n    outputfile] [-out_format\
  \ output_format] [-calc sum|mean|diff]\n\n\e[1mINPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    \e\
  [33mmerge-matrices\e[0m supports the same input and output formats as\n    \e[33mconvert-matrix\e\
  [0m.\n\n  \e[1mConstraint on matrix widths\e[0m\n    The merging operations assume\
  \ that all input matrices have the same\n    width.\n\n\e[1mSEE ALSO\e[0m\n  \e\
  [1mconvert-matrix\e[0m\n  \e[1mmatrix-clustering\e[0m\n    The program \e[33mmatrix-clustering\e\
  [0m uses \e[33mmerge-matrices\e[0m to generate the merged\n    matrices and consensuses\
  \ at each intermediate branch of the matrix tree.\n\n\e[1mWISH LIST\e[0m\n    \e\
  [1m-merged_attr key value\e[0m\n        Impose the value of specific attribtues\
  \ of the merged matrix.\n\n        This option is useful to specify meaningful identifiers\
  \ or names\n        depending on the context of the analysis.\n\n    \e[1m-consensus_name\e\
  [0m\n        Calculate the consensus and use it as name for the merged matrix.\n\
  \n    \e[1mdecimals\e[0m\n        JvH should Fix a bug with the decimals: currently,\
  \ they only apply\n        to frequencies, not to counts.\n\n\e[1mOPTIONS\e[0m\n\
  \    \e[1m-v #\e[0m\n        Level of verbosity (detail in the warning messages\
  \ during execution)\n\n    \e[1m-h\e[0m  Display full help message\n\n    \e[1m-help\e\
  [0m\n        Same as -h\n\n    \e[1m-i inputfile\e[0m\n        If no input file\
  \ is specified, the standard input is used. This\n        allows to use the command\
  \ within a pipe.\n\n    \e[1m-in_format input_formaat\e[0m\n        Input format.\
  \ See \e[33mconvert-matrix\e[0m for a list of supported input\n        formats.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-id matrix_ID\e[0m\n        Specify the ID of the output matrix.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-name matrix_name\e[0m\n        Specify the name of the output matrix.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-calc merging_stat\e[0m\n        Specify the operator used to merge matrices.\n\
  \n        Supported:\n\n        \e[33mmean\e[0m (default)\n            Each cell\
  \ of the output matrix contains the mean of the values\n            found in the\
  \ corresponding cell of the input matrices.\n\n        \e[33msum\e[0m Each cell\
  \ of the output matrix contains the sum of the values\n            found in the\
  \ corresponding cell of the input matrices.\n\n        \e[33mdiff\e[0m\n       \
  \     Each cell of the output matrix contains the difference between\n         \
  \   the two input matrices. \e[1mBeware\e[0m: this option ssumes that the\n    \
  \        input file contains only two matrices.\n\n        If specified, the merged\
  \ matrix (computed with sum or mean) and the\n        sequences are passed to \e\
  [33mrescan-matrix\e[0m in order to build a secondary\n        matrix from binding\
  \ sites foundin the input sequence.\n\n        A typical application is the merging\
  \ of matrices obtained by\n        different motif discovery algorithms in ChIP-seq\
  \ peak sequences.\n        This enables to base the merged matrix on the actual\
  \ (predicted)\n        sites from the sequence rather than summing counts which\
  \ are liely\n        to result from largely overlapping colections of sites. .\n\
  \n    \e[1m-iterations #\e[0m\n        Maximal number of iterations for rescan-matrix\
  \ (useful only if\n        combined with -seq option).\n\n    \e[1m-scan_param scanning_parameters\e\
  [0m\n        Parameters to scan the sites. The argument is passed to\n        rescan-matrix.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-o outputfile\e[0m\n        If no output file is specified, the standard\
  \ output is used. This\n        allows to use the command within a pipe.\n\n   \
  \ \e[1m-out_format output_formaat\e[0m\n        Output format. See \e[33mconvert-matrix\e\
  [0m for a list of supportd output\n        formats.\n\n"
