- id: add
  doc: 'Annotation(s) file you would like to use to complement the reference annotation.
    You can specify as much file you want like so: -a addfile1 -a addfile2 -a addfile3
    /!\ The order you provide these files matter. Once the reference file has been
    complemented by file1, this new annotation becomes the new reference that will
    be complemented by file2 etc. /!\ The result with -a addfile1 -a addfile2 will
    differ to the result from -a addfile2 -a addfile1. So, be aware of what you want
    if you use several addfiles.'

    is over the minimum size defined. Default = 0 that means all of them are kept.
