  description: This file is a subset of the 'input_file'. It only contains the genes/transcripts
    called as differentially expressed (DE). When more than 2 conditions exist, DE
    is defined as not all conditions are equally expressed. Because statistical significance
    does not necessarily mean biological significance, users should also refer to
    the fold changes to decide which genes/transcripts are biologically significant.
    When more than two conditions exist, this file will not contain fold change information
    and users need to calculate it from 'input_file.condmeans' by themselves.
