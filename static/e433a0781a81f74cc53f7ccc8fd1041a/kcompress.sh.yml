help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified July 16, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Compresses sequence data into a fasta file containing each kmer\nexactly once.\
  \  Allows arbitrary kmer set operations via multiple passes.\n\nUsage:  kcompress.sh\
  \ in=<reads> out=<contigs> min=<1> max=<2147483647>\n\nInput parameters:\nin=<file>\
  \           Primary input file for reads to use as kmer data.\nin2=<file>      \
  \    Second input file for paired data.\nreads=-1            Only process this number\
  \ of reads, then quit (-1 means all).\n\nOutput parameters:\nout=<file>        \
  \  Write contigs (in contig mode).\nshowstats=t         Print assembly statistics\
  \ after writing contigs.\nfuse=0              Fuse output sequences into chunks\
  \ at least this long,\n                    padded with 1 N between sequences.\n\n\
  Prefiltering parameters:\nprefilter=0         If set to a positive integer, use\
  \ a countmin sketch\n                    to ignore kmers with depth of that value\
  \ or lower.\nprehashes=2         Number of hashes for prefilter.\nprefiltersize=0.2\
  \   (pff) Fraction of memory to use for prefilter.\nminprobprefilter=t  (mpp) Use\
  \ minprob for the prefilter.\nprepasses=1         Use this many prefiltering passes;\
  \ higher be more thorough\n                    if the filter is very full.  Set\
  \ to 'auto' to iteratively \n                    prefilter until the remaining kmers\
  \ will fit in memory.\n\nHashing parameters:\nk=31                Kmer length (1\
  \ to 31).\nprealloc=t          Pre-allocate memory rather than dynamically growing;\
  \ \n                    faster and more memory-efficient.  A float fraction (0-1)\n\
  \                    may be specified; default is 1.\nminprob=0.5         Ignore\
  \ kmers with overall probability of correctness below this.\nminprobmain=t     \
  \  (mpm) Use minprob for the primary kmer counts.\nthreads=X           Spawn X threads\
  \ (default is number of logical processors).\n\nAssembly parameters:\nmincount=1\
  \          (min) Only retain kmers that occur at least this many times.\nmaxcount=BIG\
  \        (max) Only retain kmers that occur at most this many times.\nrequiresamecount\
  \    (rsc) Only build contigs from kmers with exactly the same count.\nrcomp=t \
  \            Store forward and reverse kmers together.  Setting this to\n      \
  \              false will only use forward kmers.\n\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx  \
  \              This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n  \
  \                  -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify\
  \ 200 megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n\
  -eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n           \
  \         out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da           \
  \      Disable assertions.\n\n"
