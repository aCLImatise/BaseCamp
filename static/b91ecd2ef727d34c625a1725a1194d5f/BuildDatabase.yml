  \ - 2.0.1\nNAME\n    BuildDatabase - Format FASTA files for use with RepeatModeler\n\
  \nSYNOPSIS\n      BuildDatabase [-options] -name \"mydb\" <seqfile(s) in fasta format>\n\
  \     or \n      BuildDatabase [-options] -name \"mydb\" \n                    \
  \              -dir <dir containing fasta files *.fa, *.fasta,\n               \
  \                          *.fast, *.FA, *.FASTA, *.FAST, *.dna,\n             \
  \                            and  *.DNA > \n     or\n      BuildDatabase [-options]\
  \ -name \"mydb\" \n                                  -batch <file containing a list\
  \ of fasta files>\n\nDESCRIPTION\n      This is basically a wrapper around AB-Blast's\
  \ and NCBI Blast's\n      DB formating programs.  It assists in aggregating files\
  \ for processing \n      into a single database.  Source files can be specified\
  \ by:\n\n          - Placing the names of the FASTA files on the command\n     \
  \       line.\n          - Providing the name of a directory containing FASTA files\
  \ \n            with the file suffixes *.fa or *.fasta.\n          - Providing the\
  \ name of a manifest file which contains the \n            names of FASTA files\
  \ ( fully qualified ) one per line.\n\n      NOTE: Sequence identifiers are not\
  \ preserved in this database. Each\n            sequence is assigned a new GI (\
  \ starting from 1 ).  The \n            translation back to the original sequence\
  \ is preserved in the\n            *.translation file.\n\n    The options are:\n\
  \n    -h(elp)\n        Detailed help\n\n    -name <database name>\n        The name\
  \ of the database to create.\n\n    -engine <engine name>\n        The name of the\
  \ search engine we are using. I.e abblast/wublast or\n        rmblast.\n\n    -dir\
  \ <directory>\n        The name of a directory containing fasta files to be processed.\
  \ The\n        files are recognized by their suffix. Only *.fa and *.fasta files\n\
  \        are processed.\n\n    -batch <file>\n        The name of a file which contains\
  \ the names of fasta files to\n        process. The files names are listed one per\
  \ line and should be fully\n        qualified.\n\nSEE ALSO\n        RepeatModeler,\
