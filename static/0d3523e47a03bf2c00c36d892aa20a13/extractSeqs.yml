help_text: "extractSeqs <int: taxonomyID> <filename: input file of sequences> <filename:\
  \ input file of the CLARK/CLARK-S results> <filename: output file to store the extracted\
  \ sequences> <double: minGamma> <double: minConfidence>\n Notes: \n (1) The CLARK/CLARK-S\
  \ results file should be the file produced from the input file of the sequences.\
  \ \n (2) There is no need to put an extension for the output file generated by this\
  \ program. It will be automatically set, it is the same format than the input file\
  \ of the sequences. \n (3) The taxonomyID should make sense for the results file\
  \ with respect to the taxonomy rank used. If the results file was created for example\
  \ at the species level classification then the taxonomyID should be a taxon for\
  \ that same rank (i.e., species).\n"
