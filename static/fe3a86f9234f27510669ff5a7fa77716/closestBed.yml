  description: In addition to the closest feature in B,  report its distance to A
    as an extra column. - The reported distance for overlapping features will be 0.
  synonyms:
  - -d
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Like -d, report the closest feature in B, and its distance to A as
    an extra column. Unlike -d, use negative distances to report upstream features.
    The options for defining which orientation is "upstream" are: - "ref"   Report
    distance with respect to the reference genome.  B features with a lower (start,
    stop) are upstream - "a"     Report distance with respect to A. When A is on the
    - strand, "upstream" means B has a higher (start,stop). - "b"     Report distance
    with respect to B. When B is on the - strand, "upstream" means A has a higher
    (start,stop).'

  - -D
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Ignore features in B that overlap A.  That is, we want close, yet not
    touching features only.
  synonyms:
  - -io
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Ignore features in B that are upstream of features in A. This option
    requires -D and follows its orientation rules for determining what is "upstream".
  synonyms:
  - -iu
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Ignore features in B that are downstream of features in A. This option
    requires -D and follows its orientation rules for determining what is "downstream".
  synonyms:
  - -id
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Choose first from features in B that are upstream of features in A.
    This option requires -D and follows its orientation rules for determining what
    is "upstream".

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true

  description: Choose first from features in B that are downstream of features in
    A. This option requires -D and follows its orientation rules for determining what
    is "downstream".

  - -fd
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'How ties for closest feature are handled.  This occurs when two features
    in B have exactly the same "closeness" with A. By default, all such features in
    B are reported. Here are all the options: - "all"    Report all ties (default).
    - "first"  Report the first tie that occurred in the B file. - "last"   Report
    the last tie that occurred in the B file.'
  synonyms:
  - -t
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: How multiple databases are resolved. - "each"    Report closest records
    for each database (default). - "all"  Report closest records among all databases.
  synonyms:
  - -mdb
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Report the k closest hits. Default is 1. If tieMode = "all",  - all
    ties will still be reported.
  synonyms:
  - -k
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the query and the closest hit have different names. For
    BED, the 4th column is compared.
  synonyms:
  - -N
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to
    strand.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that
    overlap A on the _opposite_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without
    respect to strand.
  synonyms:
  - -S
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  - -F
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B. - In other
    words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90% of A and
    A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.
  synonyms:
  - -r
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B. - In other
    words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires that either 90% of
    A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered. Without -e, both fractions would have to
    be satisfied.

  description: Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order across
    input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.
  synonyms:
  - -g
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming
    conventions for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

  description: When using multiple databases, provide an alias for each that will
    appear instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Print
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line of
    output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved in a buffer. This will
    make printing large output files  noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction
    with other software tools and scripts that need to process one line of bedtools
    output at a time.
