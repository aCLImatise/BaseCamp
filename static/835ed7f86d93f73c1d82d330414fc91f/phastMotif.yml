help_text: "\nPROGRAM:      phastMotif\n\nDESCRIPTION:  Predicts motifs from a set\
  \ of multiple alignments.  Uses\n              an EM algorithm similar to that of\
  \ MEME, but a motif is\n              defined by phylogenetic models rather than\
  \ multinomial\n              distributions.  The specified multiple alignments may\n\
  \              actually be single sequences (see -m).  Various parameters\n    \
  \          control the strategy for initialization (see below).\n              Currently,\
  \ the F81 substitution model is assumed.\n\nUSAGE:        phastMotif [-t <treefile>]\
  \ [OPTIONS] <msa_list>\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -t <file> (Required unless -m or -p) Use\
  \ specified tree topology for\n              all phylogenetic models (Newick format).\n\
  \n    -i <fmt>  Input format for alignment.  May be FASTA, PHYLIP, MPM, SS,\n  \

  \n    -n <n>    Perform <n> random restarts and report the motif with highest\n\
