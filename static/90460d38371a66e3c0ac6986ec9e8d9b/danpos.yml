help_text: "\ndanpos version 2.2.2\nFor help information for each function, try:\n\
  python danpos.py <function> -h\n\nFunctions:\n\tdpos:\n\t\tanalyze each protein-binding\
  \ position (~100\n\t\tto ~200bp wide) across the whole genome,\n\t\te.g. nucleosome\
  \ positions.\n\tdpeak:\n\t\tanalyze each protein-binding peak (~1 to ~1kb\n\t\t\
  wide) across the whole genome, e.g. protein\n\t\tthat binds accruately to some specific\
  \ motifs.\n\tdregion:\n\t\tanalyze each protein-binding region (~1 to\n\t\t~10kb\
  \ wide) across the whole genome, e.g.\n\t\tsome histone modifications.\n\tdtriple:\n\
  \t\tDo analysis at all three levels including each\n\t\tregion, peak, and position.\
  \ Would be useful\n\t\twhen little is known about the potential binding\n\t\tpattern.\n\
  \tprofile:\n\t\tanalyze wiggle format occupancy or differential\n\t\tsignal profile\
  \ relative to gene structures or\n\t\tbed format genomic regions.\n\twiq:\n\t\t\
  normalize wiggle files to have the same quantiles (Quantile normalization).\n\t\
  wig2wiq:\n\t\tconvert wiggle format file to wiq format.\n\tstat:\n\t\tsome statistics\
  \ for positions, peaks, or regions.\n\tselector:\n\t\tselect a subset of positions,\
  \ peaks, or regions\n\t\tby value ranges or gene structures neighboring.\n\tvaluesAtRanks:\n\
  \t\tretrieve position, peak, or region values by ranks.\n\nKaifu Chen, et al. chenkaifu@gmail.com,\
