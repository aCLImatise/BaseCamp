help_text: "CONVERTS PHASED BEAGLE OUTPUT TO CHROMOPAINTER-STYLE INPUT FILES\nusage:\
  \   perl beagle2chromopainter.pl <options> beagle_phased_output_file output_filename_prefix\n\
  where:\n        (i) beagle_phased_output_file = filename of BEAGLE v3 or less (not\
  \ vcf!) phased file (unzipped) that contains phased haplotypes\n        (ii) output_filename_prefix\
  \ = filename prefix for chromopainter input file(s). The suffixes \".phase\" amd\
  \ \".ids\" are added\n\nThe output, by default, is in CHROMOPAINTER v2 input format.\
  \ NOTE THAT ONLY BIALLELIC SNPS ARE RETAINED, i.e. we omit triallelic and non-polymorphic\
  \ sites.\n<options>:\n-J:                 Jitter (add 1) to snp locations if snps\
  \ are not strictly ascending. Otherwise an error is produced.\n<further options>\
  \   NOTE: YOU ONLY NEED THESE OPTIONS FOR BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY!\n-v1:       \
  \         Produce output compatible with CHROMOPAINTER v1, i.e. include the line\
  \ of \"S\" for each SNP. \n-f:                 By default, this script produces\
  \ PHASE-style output, which differs from \n\t\t\t   ChromoPainter input which requires\
  \ an additional first line.  This option creates the correct\n\t\t           first\
  \ line for standard fineSTRUCTURE usage (i.e. the first line is \"0\", all other\
  \ lines are appended)\n\n !!! WARNING:  THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY CHECK\
  \ FOR MISSPECIFIED FILES. WE ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS RUNNING INCORRECTLY !!!\n\
  NOTE: TO USE IN CHROMOPAINTER: You also need a recombination map. Create this with\
  \ the \"convertrecfile.pl\" or \"makeuniformrecfile.pl\" scripts provided.\n\n"
