  description: By default we predict protein in UTR3 and UTR5 and in both direction.
    The fusion assumed can be between gene in same direction and in opposite direction.
    If RNAseq data used during the annotation was stranded, only fusion of close genes
    oriented in same direction are expected. In that case this option should be activated.
    When activated, we will try to predict protein in UTR3 and UTR5 only in the same
    orientation than the gene investigated.
