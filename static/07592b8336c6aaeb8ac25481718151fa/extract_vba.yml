help_text: "NAME\n    extract_vba - A utility to extract a VBA project from an Excel\
  \ 2007+\n    xlsm file.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    This utility is used to extract the\
  \ VBA project binary from an Excel\n    2007+ xlsm file. The VBA project can then\
  \ be added to an\n    Excel::Writer::XLSX file to enable it to have macros.\n\n\
  \    An \"xlsm\" file is a version of an Excel \"xlsx\" file that contains an\n\
  \    additional VBA project binary file. The \"xlsm\" file format is a\n    collection\
  \ of mainly XML files in a ZIP container.\n\n    The extracted VBA project is an\
  \ OLE Compound Document in binary format.\n    It is named \"vbaProject.bin\" and\
  \ is generally located in the \"xl\"\n    directory of the \"xlsm\" file.\n\n  \
  \  See the \"add_vba_project()\" section of the Excel::Writer::XLSX\n    documentation\
  \ for more details.\n\n    Note: you can also extract the VBA project from an \"\
  xlsm\" file using the\n    standard Linux \"unzip\" command:\n\n        unzip -j\
  \ macro01.xlsm xl/vbaProject.bin\n\n    On Windows you can use any suitable Unzip\
  \ application.\n\nSYNOPSIS\n        $ extract_vba file.xlsm\n        Extracted 'vbaProject.bin'\
  \ successfully\n\n        $ extract_vba -h # For help.\n\nOPTIONS\n    --help or\
  \ -h\n        Print the help documentation.\n\nAUTHOR\n    John McNamara jmcnamara@cpan.org\n\
