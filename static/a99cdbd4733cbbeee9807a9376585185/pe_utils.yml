  description: Compute insert length for given sample. Takes as input (1) a comma-separated
    list of sorted, indexed BAM files with headers (or a single BAM filename), (2)
    a GFF file with constitutive exons. Outputs the insert length distribution into
    the output directory.

  - --compute-insert-len
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: COMPUTE_INSERT_LEN
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If provided, this ignores the BAM file flags that state whether the
    read was paired or not, and instead uses only the read IDs to pair up the mates.
    Use this if your paired-end BAM was the result of a samtools merge operation.
  synonyms:
  - --no-bam-filter
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum size of constitutive exon (in nucleotides) that should be used
    in the computation. Default is 500 bp.
  synonyms:
  - --min-exon-size
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: MIN_EXON_SIZE
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Number of standard deviations used to define outliers. By default,
    set to 2, meaning that any points at least 2*sigma away from the mean of the insert
    length distribution will be discarded.

  - --sd-max
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: SD_MAX
  optional: true
