  description: 'blockcountsplit Split XMFA of 2 genomes into 3 XMFA files: blocks
    with both genomes and genome-specific blocks for each genome. extract        Extract
    sequence for whole genome or genomic interval. join           Join LCBs from 2
    XMFA files, assigning genome_ids as in first XMFA file (-x). maf            Write
    MAF file from XMFA file. map            Map positions/coordinates from consensus
    to sequences, between sequences, ... merge          Add small LCBs to end or beginning
    of surrounding LCBs. Can only be used with two aligned sequences. realign        Realign
    sequences of LCBs around consecutive gaps. Can only be used with two aligned sequences.
    reconstruct    Build alignment of all genomes from .XMFA file with new genome
    aligned to consensus sequence. remove         Remove a genome from all LCBs in
    alignment. resolve        Resolve LCBs stretching over delimiter sequences. separate       Separate
    small multi-sequence LCBs to form genome specific entries. split          Split
    LCBs according to chromosome annotation. xmfa           Write XMFA file from XMFA
    file (for reordering or checking validity).'
