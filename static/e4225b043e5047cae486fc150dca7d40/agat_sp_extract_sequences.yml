  description: This option allows dealing with multifeature like cds or exon, to extract
    the full sequence from start extremity to the end extremity, i.e with introns.
    Use of that option with exon will give the same result as extract the mrna sequence
    (-t mRNA) and corresponds to the cdna*. (To actually extract an mRNA as it is
    defined biologicaly you need to use the -t exon option wihtout the --full option
    and wihtout the --split option) Use of that option on cds will give the cdna*
    wihtout the untraslated sequences. *Not a real cdna because it is not reversed
  synonyms:
  - --full

  optional: true

  description: ", -5, --five or -upstream Integer. It will take that number of nucleotide\
    \ in more at the 5' extremity. /!\\ You must activate the option \"--full\" if\
    \ you with to extract only the most upstream part of certain feature (exon,cds,utr)\
    \ otherwise you will extract each upstream parts of the subfeatures (e.g many\
    \ cds parts may be needed to shape a cds in its whole)."
  synonyms:
  - --up
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: ", -3, --three, -down or -downstream Integer. It will take that number\
    \ of nucleotide in more at the 3' extremity. /!\\ You must activate the option\
    \ \"--full\" if you with to extract only the most downstream part of certain feature\
    \ (exon,cds,utr) otherwise you will extract each downstream parts of the subfeatures\
    \ (e.g many cds parts may be needed to shape a cds in its whole)."

  description: This extract the cdna* sequence (i.e transcribed sequence (devoid of
    introns, but containing untranslated exons)). It corresponds to extract the exons
    sequences. *Not a real cdna because it is not reversed

    a space < > but can be modified by any String or character using this option.

  description: The Clean Internal Stop option allows replacing the translation of
    the stop codons present among the sequence that is represented by the <*> character
    by <X>. Indeed the <*> character can be disturbing for many programs (e.g interproscan)
  synonyms:
  - --clean_internal_stop
  - --cis
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: or
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The Clean Final Stop option allows removing the translation of the
    final stop codons that is represented by the <*> character. This character can
    be disturbing for many programs (e.g interproscan)
  synonyms:
  - --clean_final_stop
  - --cfs
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: or
  optional: true

  description: CDS can start with a phase different from 0 when a gene model is fragmented.
    When asking for protein translation this (start) offset is trimmed out automatically.
    But when you extract CDS dna sequences, this (start) offset is not removed by
    default. To remove it activate this option. If --up or --do option are used too,
    the (start) offset is trimmed first, then is added the piece of sequence asked
    for.
