help_text: "\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThis script is supposed to convert a specified reference\
  \ genome into two different bisulfite\nconverted versions and index them for alignments\
  \ with Bowtie 2 (default), or HISAT2. The first\nbisulfite genome will have all\
  \ Cs converted to Ts (C->T), and the other one will have all Gs\nconverted to As\
  \ (G->A). Both bisulfite genomes will be stored in subfolders within the reference\n\
  genome folder. Once the bisulfite conversion has been completed, the program will\
  \ fork and launch\ntwo simultaneous instances of the Bowtie 2 or HISAT2 indexer\
  \ (bowtie2-build or hisat2-build,\nresepctively). Be aware that the indexing process\
  \ can take up to several hours; this will mainly\ndepend on genome size and system\
  \ resources.\n\nThe new, and still experimental, --slam mode will produce T->C and\
  \ A->G converted genomes instead.\nThe structure of the genome folder will remain\
  \ the same as for BS-Seq data. This might, or might not,\nchange in a future release.\n\
