  description: Use the frequencies of mutations when performing the subtraction. Normally
    an input mutation is removed if it appears at any frequency in a subtracted file.
    In this mode its frequency is reduced by the frequency in each subtracted file.
    If the resulting frequency is zero or below, then the mutation is removed.
