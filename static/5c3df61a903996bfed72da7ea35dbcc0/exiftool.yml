  \ the EXAMPLES sections below.\n\n    This documentation is displayed if exiftool\
  \ is run without an input\n    \e[4mFILE\e[0m when one is expected.\n\n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e\
  [0m\n    A command-line interface to Image::ExifTool, used for reading and writing\n\
  \    meta information in a variety of file types. \e[4mFILE\e[0m is one or more\
  \ source\n    file names, directory names, or \"-\" for the standard input. Metadata\
  \ is\n    read from source files and printed in readable form to the console (or\n\
  \    written to output text files with \e[1m-w\e[0m).\n\n    To write or delete\
  \ metadata, tag values are assigned using -\e[4mTAG\e[0m=[\e[4mVALUE\e[0m],\n  \
  \  and/or the \e[1m-geotag\e[0m, \e[1m-csv=\e[0m or \e[1m-json=\e[0m options. To\
  \ copy or move metadata, the\n    \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m feature is used. By default\
  \ the original files are preserved\n    with \"_original\" appended to their names\
  \ -- be sure to verify that the new\n    files are OK before erasing the originals.\
  \ Once in write mode, exiftool\n    will ignore any read-specific options.\n\n \
  \   Note: If \e[4mFILE\e[0m is a directory name then only supported file types in\
  \ the\n    directory are processed (in write mode only writable types are processed).\n\
  \    However, files may be specified by name, or the \e[1m-ext\e[0m option may be\
  \ used to\n    force processing of files with any extension. Hidden files in the\n\
  \    directory are also processed. Adding the \e[1m-r\e[0m option causes subdirectories\n\
  \    to be processed recursively, but those with names beginning with \".\" are\n\
  \    skipped unless \e[1m-r.\e[0m is used.\n\n    Below is a list of file types\
  \ and meta information formats currently\n    supported by ExifTool (r = read, w\
  \ = write, c = create):\n\n      File Types\n      ------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+------------\n\

  \ Tag operations\n    \e[1m-\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m Extract information for the specified\
  \ tag (eg. \"-CreateDate\").\n         Multiple tags may be specified in a single\
  \ command. A tag name is the\n         handle by which a piece of information is\
  \ referenced. See\n         Image::ExifTool::TagNames for documentation on available\
  \ tag names. A\n         tag name may include leading group names separated by colons\
  \ (eg.\n         \"-EXIF:CreateDate\", or \"-Doc1:XMP:Creator\"), and each group\
  \ name may\n         be prefixed by a digit to specify family number (eg. \"-1IPTC:City\"\
  ).\n         Use the \e[1m-listg\e[0m option to list available group names by family.\n\
  \n         A special tag name of \"All\" may be used to indicate all meta\n    \
  \     information (ie. \e[1m-All\e[0m). This is particularly useful when a group\
  \ name\n         is specified to extract all information in a group (but beware\
  \ that\n         unless the \e[1m-a\e[0m option is also used, some tags in the group\
  \ may be\n         suppressed by same-named tags in other groups). The wildcard\n\
  \         characters \"?\" and \"*\" may be used in a tag name to match any single\n\
  \         character and zero or more characters respectively. These may not be\n\
  \         used in a group name, with the exception that a group name of \"*\" (or\n\
  \         \"All\") may be used to extract all instances of a tag (as if \e[1m-a\e\
  [0m was\n         used). Note that arguments containing wildcards must be quoted\
  \ on the\n         command line of most systems to prevent shell globbing.\n\n \
  \        A \"#\" may be appended to the tag name to disable the print conversion\n\
  \         on a per-tag basis (see the \e[1m-n\e[0m option). This may also be used\
  \ when\n         writing or copying tags.\n\n         If no tags are specified,\
  \ all available information is extracted (as\n         if \"-All\" had been specified).\n\
  \n         Note: Descriptions, not tag names, are shown by default when\n      \
  \   extracting information. Use the \e[1m-s\e[0m option to see the tag names\n \
  \        instead.\n\n    \e[1m--\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m\n         Exclude specified tag\
  \ from extracted information. Same as the \e[1m-x\e[0m\n         option. Group names\
  \ and wildcards are permitted as described above\n         for \e[1m-TAG\e[0m. Once\
  \ excluded from the output, a tag may not be re-included\n         by a subsequent\
  \ option. May also be used following a\n         \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m option\
  \ to exclude tags from being copied (when\n         redirecting to another tag,\
  \ it is the source tag that should be\n         excluded), or to exclude groups\
  \ from being deleted when deleting all\n         information (eg. \"-all= --exif:all\"\
  \ deletes all but EXIF\n         information). But note that this will not exclude\
  \ individual tags\n         from a group delete (unless a family 2 group is specified,\
  \ see note 4\n         below). Instead, individual tags may be recovered using the\n\
  \         \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m option (eg. \"-all= -tagsfromfile @ -artist\"\
  ).\n\n    \e[1m-\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m[+-^]\e[1m=\e[0m[\e[4mVALUE\e[0m]\n         Write\
  \ a new value for the specified tag (eg. \"-comment=wow\"), or\n         delete\
  \ the tag if no \e[4mVALUE\e[0m is given (eg. \"-comment=\"). \"+=\" and \"-=\"\n\
  \         are used to add or remove existing entries from a list, or to shift\n\
  \         date/time values (see Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl and note 6 below for\n\
  \         more details). \"+=\" may also be used to increment numerical values\n\
  \         (or decrement if \e[4mVALUE\e[0m is negative), and \"-=\" may be used\
  \ to\n         conditionally delete or replace a tag (see \"WRITING EXAMPLES\" for\n\
  \         examples). \"^=\" is used to write an empty string instead of deleting\n\
  \         the tag when no \e[4mVALUE\e[0m is given, but otherwise it is equivalent\
  \ to\n         \"=\".\n\n         \e[4mTAG\e[0m may contain one or more leading\
  \ family 0, 1 or 2 group names,\n         prefixed by optional family numbers, and\
  \ separated colons. If no\n         group name is specified, the tag is created\
  \ in the preferred group,\n         and updated in any other location where a same-named\
  \ tag already\n         exists. The preferred group is the first group in the following\
  \ list\n         where \e[4mTAG\e[0m is valid: 1) EXIF, 2) IPTC, 3) XMP.\n\n   \
  \      The wildcards \"*\" and \"?\" may be used in tag names to assign the same\n\
  \         value to multiple tags. When specified with wildcards, \"unsafe\" tags\n\
  \         are not written. A tag name of \"All\" is equivalent to \"*\" (except\n\
  \         that it doesn't require quoting, while arguments with wildcards do on\n\
  \         systems with shell globbing), and is often used when deleting all\n  \
  \       metadata (ie. \"-All=\") or an entire group (eg. \"-XMP-dc:All=\", see\n\
  \         note 4 below). Note that not all groups are deletable, and that the\n\
  \         JPEG APP14 \"Adobe\" group is not removed by default with \"-All=\"\n\
  \         because it may affect the appearance of the image. However, color\n  \
  \       space information is removed, so the colors may be affected (but this\n\
  \         may be avoided by copying back the tags defined by the ColorSpaceTags\n\
  \         shortcut). Use the \e[1m-listd\e[0m option for a complete list of deletable\n\
  \         groups, and see note 5 below regarding the \"APP\" groups. Also, within\n\
  \         an image some groups may be contained within others, and these groups\n\
  \         are removed if the containing group is deleted:\n\n           JPEG Image:\n\
  \           - Deleting EXIF or IFD0 also deletes ExifIFD, GlobParamIFD,\n      \
  \       GPS, IFD1, InteropIFD, MakerNotes, PrintIM and SubIFD.\n           - Deleting\
  \ ExifIFD also deletes InteropIFD and MakerNotes.\n           - Deleting Photoshop\
  \ also deletes IPTC.\n\n           TIFF Image:\n           - Deleting EXIF only\
  \ removes ExifIFD which also deletes\n             InteropIFD and MakerNotes.\n\n\
  \         Notes:\n\n         1) \e[1mMany tag values may be assigned in a single\
  \ command\e[0m. If two\n         assignments affect the same tag, the latter takes\
  \ precedence (except\n         for list-type tags, for which both values are written).\n\
  \n         2) In general, MakerNotes tags are considered \"Permanent\", and may\
  \ be\n         edited but not created or deleted individually. This avoids many\n\
  \         potential problems, including the inevitable compatibility problems\n\
  \         with OEM software which may be very inflexible about the information\n\
  \         it expects to find in the maker notes.\n\n         3) Changes to PDF files\
  \ by ExifTool are reversible (by deleting the\n         update with \"-PDF-update:all=\"\
  ) because the original information is\n         never actually deleted from the\
  \ file. So ExifTool alone may not be\n         used to securely edit metadata in\
  \ PDF files.\n\n         4) Specifying \"-GROUP:all=\" deletes the entire group\
  \ as a block only\n         if a single family 0 or 1 group is specified. Otherwise\
  \ all deletable\n         tags in the specified group(s) are removed individually,\
  \ and in this\n         case is it possible to exclude individual tags from a mass\
  \ delete.\n         For example, \"-time:all --Exif:Time:All\" removes all deletable\
  \ Time\n         tags except those in the EXIF. This difference also applies if\
  \ family\n         2 is specified when deleting all groups. For example, \"-2all:all=\"\
  \n         deletes tags individually, while \"-all:all=\" deletes entire blocks.\n\
  \n         5) The \"APP\" group names (\"APP0\" through \"APP15\") are used to delete\n\
  \         JPEG application segments which are not associated with another\n    \
  \     deletable group. For example, specifying \"-APP14:All=\" will NOT\n      \
  \   delete the APP14 \"Adobe\" segment because this is accomplished with\n     \
  \    \"-Adobe:All\".\n\n         6) When shifting a value, the shift is applied\
  \ to the original value\n         of the tag, overriding any other values previously\
  \ assigned to the\n         tag on the same command line. To shift a date/time value\
  \ and copy it\n         to another tag in the same operation, use the \e[1m-globalTimeShift\e\
  [0m\n         option.\n\n         Special feature: Integer values may be specified\
  \ in hexadecimal with\n         a leading \"0x\", and simple rational values may\
  \ be specified as\n         fractions.\n\n    \e[1m-\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m<=\e[4mDATFILE\e\
  [0m or \e[1m-\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m<=\e[4mFMT\e[0m\n         Set the value of a tag\
  \ from the contents of file \e[4mDATFILE\e[0m. The file\n         name may also\
  \ be given by a \e[4mFMT\e[0m string where %d, %f and %e represent\n         the\
  \ directory, file name and extension of the original \e[4mFILE\e[0m (see the\n \
  \        \e[1m-w\e[0m option for more details). Note that quotes are required around\n\
  \         this argument to prevent shell redirection since it contains a \"<\"\n\
  \         symbol. If \e[4mDATFILE\e[0m/\e[4mFMT\e[0m is not provided, the effect\
  \ is the same as\n         \"-TAG=\", and the tag is simply deleted. \"+<=\" or\
  \ \"-<=\" may also be\n         used to add or delete specific list entries, or\
  \ to shift date/time\n         values.\n\n    \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m \e[4mSRCFILE\e\
  [0m or \e[4mFMT\e[0m\n         Copy tag values from \e[4mSRCFILE\e[0m to \e[4mFILE\e\
  [0m. Tag names on the command line\n         after this option specify the tags\
  \ to be copied, or excluded from the\n         copy. Wildcards are permitted in\
  \ these tag names. If no tags are\n         specified, then all possible tags (see\
  \ note 1 below) from the source\n         file are copied to same-named tags in\
  \ the preferred location of the\n         output file (the same as specifying \"\
  -all\"). More than one\n         \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m option may be used to copy\
  \ tags from multiple files.\n\n         By default, this option will update any\
  \ existing and writable\n         same-named tags in the output \e[4mFILE\e[0m,\
  \ but will create new tags only in\n         their preferred groups. This allows\
  \ some information to be\n         automatically transferred to the appropriate\
  \ group when copying\n         between images of different formats. However, if\
  \ a group name is\n         specified for a tag then the information is written\
  \ only to this\n         group (unless redirected to another group, see below).\
  \ If \"All\" is\n         used as a group name, then the specified tag(s) are written\
  \ to the\n         same family 1 group they had in the source file (ie. the same\n\
  \         specific location, like ExifIFD or XMP-dc). For example, the common\n\
  \         operation of copying all writable tags to the same specific locations\n\
  \         in the output \e[4mFILE\e[0m is achieved by adding \"-all:all\". A different\n\
  \         family may be specified by adding a leading family number to the\n   \
  \      group name (eg. \"-0all:all\" preserves the same general location, like\n\
  \         EXIF or XMP).\n\n         \e[4mSRCFILE\e[0m may be the same as \e[4mFILE\e\
  [0m to move information around within a\n         single file. In this case, \"\
  @\" may be used to represent the source\n         file (ie. \"-tagsFromFile @\"\
  ), permitting this feature to be used for\n         batch processing multiple files.\
  \ Specified tags are then copied from\n         each file in turn as it is rewritten.\
  \ For advanced batch use, the\n         source file name may also be specified using\
  \ a \e[4mFMT\e[0m string in which\n         %d, %f and %e represent the directory,\
  \ file name and extension of\n         \e[4mFILE\e[0m. (eg. the current \e[4mFILE\e\
  [0m would be represented by \"%d%f.%e\", with\n         the same effect as \"@\"\
  ). See the \e[1m-w\e[0m option for \e[4mFMT\e[0m string examples.\n\n         A\
  \ powerful redirection feature allows a destination tag to be\n         specified\
  \ for each copied tag. With this feature, information may be\n         written to\
  \ a tag with a different name or group. This is done using\n         \"'-\e[4mDSTTAG\e\
  [0m<\e[4mSRCTAG\e[0m'\" or \"'-\e[4mSRCTAG\e[0m>\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m'\" on the command\
  \ line after\n         \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m, and causes the value of \e[4mSRCTAG\e\
  [0m to be copied from\n         \e[4mSRCFILE\e[0m and written to \e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m\
  \ in \e[4mFILE\e[0m. Has no effect unless\n         \e[4mSRCTAG\e[0m exists in \e\
  [4mSRCFILE\e[0m. Note that this argument must be quoted to\n         prevent shell\
  \ redirection, and there is no \"=\" sign as when assigning\n         new values.\
  \ Source and/or destination tags may be prefixed by a group\n         name and/or\
  \ suffixed by \"#\". Wildcards are allowed in both the source\n         and destination\
  \ tag names. A destination group and/or tag name of\n         \"All\" or \"*\" writes\
  \ to the same family 1 group and/or tag name as the\n         source. If no destination\
  \ group is specified, the information is\n         written to the preferred group.\
  \ Whitespace around the \">\" or \"<\" is\n         ignored. As a convenience, \"\
  -tagsFromFile @\" is assumed for any\n         redirected tags which are specified\
  \ without a prior \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m\n         option. Copied tags may also\
  \ be added or deleted from a list with\n         arguments of the form \"'-\e[4mSRCTAG\e\
  [0m+<\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m'\" or \"'-\e[4mSRCTAG\e[0m-<\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m'\" (but\n   \
  \      see Note 5 below).\n\n         An extension of the redirection feature allows\
  \ strings involving tag\n         names to be used on the right hand side of the\
  \ \"<\" symbol with the\n         syntax \"'-\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m<\e[4mSTR\e[0m'\",\
  \ where tag names in \e[4mSTR\e[0m are prefixed with a\n         \"$\" symbol. See\
  \ the \e[1m-p\e[0m option and the \"Advanced formatting feature\"\n         section\
  \ for more details about this syntax. Strings starting with a\n         \"=\" sign\
  \ must insert a single space after the \"<\" to avoid confusion\n         with the\
  \ \"<=\" operator which sets the tag value from the contents of\n         a file.\
  \ A single space at the start of the string is removed if it\n         exists, but\
  \ all other whitespace in the string is preserved. See note\n         8 below about\
  \ using the redirection feature with list-type stags,\n         shortcuts or when\
  \ using wildcards in tag names.\n\n         See \"COPYING EXAMPLES\" for examples\
  \ using \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m.\n\n         Notes:\n\n         1) Some tags (generally\
  \ tags which may affect the appearance of the\n         image) are considered \"\
  unsafe\" to write, and are only copied if\n         specified explicitly (ie. no\
  \ wildcards). See the tag name\n         documentation for more details about \"\
  unsafe\" tags.\n\n         2) Be aware of the difference between excluding a tag\
  \ from being\n         copied (--\e[4mTAG\e[0m), and deleting a tag (-\e[4mTAG\e\
  [0m=). Excluding a tag prevents\n         it from being copied to the destination\
  \ image, but deleting will\n         remove a pre-existing tag from the image.\n\
  \n         3) The maker note information is copied as a block, so it isn't\n   \
  \      affected like other information by subsequent tag assignments on the\n  \
  \       command line, and individual makernote tags may not be excluded from\n \
  \        a block copy. Also, since the PreviewImage referenced from the maker\n\
  \         notes may be rather large, it is not copied, and must be transferred\n\
  \         separately if desired.\n\n         4) The order of operations is to copy\
  \ all specified tags at the point\n         of the \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m option\
  \ in the command line. Any tag assignment\n         to the right of the \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e\
  [0m option is made after all tags are\n         copied. For example, new tag values\
  \ are set in the order One, Two,\n         Three then Four with this command:\n\n\
  \             exiftool -One=1 -tagsFromFile s.jpg -Two -Four=4 -Three d.jpg\n\n\
  \         This is significant in the case where an overlap exists between the\n\
  \         copied and assigned tags because later operations may override\n     \
  \    earlier ones.\n\n         5) The normal behaviour of copied tags differs from\
  \ that of assigned\n         tags for list-type tags and conditional replacements\
  \ because each\n         copy operation on a tag overrides any previous operations.\
  \ While this\n         avoids duplicate list items when copying groups of tags from\
  \ a file\n         containing redundant information, it also prevents values of\n\
  \         different tags from being copied into the same list when this is the\n\
  \         intent. So a \e[1m-addTagsFromFile\e[0m option is provided which allows\
  \ copying\n         of multiple tags into the same list. eg)\n\n             exiftool\
  \ -addtagsfromfile @ '-subject<make' '-subject<model' ...\n\n         Similarly,\
  \ \e[1m-addTagsFromFile\e[0m must be used when conditionally replacing\n       \
  \  a tag to prevent overriding earlier conditions.\n\n         Other than these\
  \ differences, the \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m and\n         \e[1m-addTagsFromFile\e\
  [0m options are equivalent.\n\n         6) The \e[1m-a\e[0m option (allow duplicate\
  \ tags) is always in effect when\n         copying tags from \e[4mSRCFILE\e[0m.\n\
  \n         7) Structured tags are copied by default when copying tags. See the\n\
  \         \e[1m-struct\e[0m option for details.\n\n         8) With the redirection\
  \ feature, copying a tag directly (ie.\n         \"'-\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m<\e[4mSRCTAG\e\
  [0m'\") is not the same as interpolating its value inside\n         a string (ie.\
  \ \"'-\e[4mDSTTAG\e[0m<$\e[4mSRCTAG\e[0m'\") for list-type tags, shortcut tags,\n\
  \         tag names containing wildcards, or UserParam variables. When copying\n\
  \         directly, the values of each matching source tag are copied\n        \
  \ individually to the destination tag (as if they were separate\n         assignments).\
  \ However, when interpolated inside a string, list items\n         and the values\
  \ of shortcut tags are concatenated (with a separator\n         set by the \e[1m-sep\e\
  [0m option), and wildcards are not allowed. Also,\n         UserParam variables\
  \ are available only when interpolated in a string.\n\n    \e[1m-x\e[0m \e[4mTAG\e\
  [0m (\e[1m-exclude\e[0m)\n         Exclude the specified tag. There may be multiple\
  \ \e[1m-x\e[0m options. This has\n         the same effect as --\e[4mTAG\e[0m on\
  \ the command line. See the --\e[4mTAG\e[0m\n         documentation above for a\
  \ complete description.\n\n   Input-output text formatting\n    Note that trailing\
  \ spaces are removed from extracted values for most\n    output text formats. The\
  \ exceptions are \"-b\", \"-csv\", \"-j\" and \"-X\".\n\n    \e[1m-args\e[0m (\e\
  [1m-argFormat\e[0m)\n         Output information in the form of exiftool arguments,\
  \ suitable for\n         use with the \e[1m-@\e[0m option when writing. May be combined\
  \ with the \e[1m-G\e[0m\n         option to include group names. This feature may\
  \ be used to\n         effectively copy tags between images, but allows the metadata\
  \ to be\n         altered by editing the intermediate file (\"out.args\" in this\n\
  \         example):\n\n             exiftool -args -G1 --filename --directory src.jpg\
  \ > out.args\n             exiftool -@ out.args -sep \", \" dst.jpg\n\n        \
  \ Note: Be careful when copying information with this technique since\n        \
  \ it is easy to write tags which are normally considered \"unsafe\". For\n     \
  \    instance, the FileName and Directory tags are excluded in the example\n   \
  \      above to avoid renaming and moving the destination file. Also note\n    \
  \     that the second command above will produce warning messages for any\n    \
  \     tags which are not writable.\n\n         As well, the \e[1m-sep\e[0m option\
  \ should be used as in the second command\n         above to maintain separate list\
  \ items when writing metadata back to\n         image files, and the \e[1m-struct\e\
  [0m option may be used when extracting to\n         preserve structured XMP information.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-b\e[0m (\e[1m-binary\e[0m)\n         Output requested metadata in binary\
  \ format without tag names or\n         descriptions. This option is mainly used\
  \ for extracting embedded\n         images or other binary data, but it may also\
  \ be useful for some text\n         strings since control characters (such as newlines)\
  \ are not replaced\n         by '.' as they are in the default output. By default,\
  \ list items are\n         separated by a newline when extracted with the \e[1m-b\e\
  [0m option, but this\n         may be changed (see the \e[1m-sep\e[0m option for\
  \ details). May be combined\n         with \"-j\", \"-php\" or \"-X\" to extract\
  \ binary data in JSON, PHP or XML\n         format, but note that \"unsafe\" tags\
  \ must be specified explicitly to\n         be extracted as binary in these formats.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-c\e[0m \e[4mFMT\e[0m (\e[1m-coordFormat\e[0m)\n         Set the print\
  \ format for GPS coordinates. \e[4mFMT\e[0m uses the same syntax as\n         a\
  \ \"printf\" format string. The specifiers correspond to degrees,\n         minutes\
  \ and seconds in that order, but minutes and seconds are\n         optional. For\
  \ example, the following table gives the output for the\n         same coordinate\
  \ using various formats:\n\n                     FMT                  Output\n \
  \            -------------------    ------------------\n             \"%d deg %d'\
  \ %.2f\"\\\"    54 deg 59' 22.80\"  (default for reading)\n             \"%d %d\
  \ %.8f\"           54 59 22.80000000  (default for copying)\n             \"%d deg\

  \ degrees\n\n         Notes:\n\n         1) To avoid loss of precision, the default\
  \ coordinate format is\n         different when copying tags using the \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e\
  [0m option.\n\n         2) If the hemisphere is known, a reference direction (N,\
  \ S, E or W)\n         is appended to each printed coordinate, but adding a \"+\"\
  \ to the\n         format specifier (eg. \"%+.6f\") prints a signed coordinate instead.\n\
  \n         3) This print formatting may be disabled with the \e[1m-n\e[0m option\
  \ to\n         extract coordinates as signed decimal degrees.\n\n    \e[1m-charset\e\

  \      demonstrate basic use of this option:\n\n             # generate CSV file\
  \ with common tags from all images in a directory\n             exiftool -common\
  \ -csv dir > out.csv\n\n             # update metadata for all images in a directory\
  \ from CSV file\n             exiftool -csv=a.csv dir\n\n         Empty values are\
  \ ignored when importing (unless the \e[1m-f\e[0m option is used\n         and the\
  \ API MissingTagValue is set to an empty string, in which case\n         the tag\
  \ is deleted). Also, FileName and Directory columns are ignored\n         if they\
  \ exist (ie. ExifTool will not attempt to write these tags with\n         a CSV\
  \ import). To force a tag to be deleted, use the \e[1m-f\e[0m option and\n     \
  \    set the value to \"-\" in the CSV file (or to the MissingTagValue if\n    \
  \     this API option was used). Multiple databases may be imported in a\n     \
  \    single command.\n\n         When exporting a CSV file, the \e[1m-g\e[0m or\
  \ \e[1m-G\e[0m option adds group names to\n         the tag headings. If the \e\
  [1m-a\e[0m option is used to allow duplicate tag\n         names, the duplicate\
  \ tags are only included in the CSV output if the\n         column headings are\
  \ unique. Adding the \e[1m-G4\e[0m option ensures a unique\n         column heading\
  \ for each tag. The \e[1m-b\e[0m option may be added to output\n         binary\
  \ data, encoded in base64 if necessary (indicated by ASCII\n         \"base64:\"\
  \ as the first 7 bytes of the value). Values may also be\n         encoded in base64\
  \ if the \e[1m-charset\e[0m option is used and the value\n         contains invalid\
  \ characters.\n\n         When exporting specific tags, the CSV columns are arranged\
  \ in the\n         same order as the specified tags provided the column headings\
  \ exactly\n         match the specified tag names, otherwise the columns are sorted\
  \ in\n         alphabetical order.\n\n         When importing from a CSV file, only\
  \ files specified on the command\n         line are processed. Any extra entries\
  \ in the CSV file are ignored.\n\n         List-type tags are stored as simple strings\
  \ in a CSV file, but the\n         \e[1m-sep\e[0m option may be used to split them\
  \ back into separate items when\n         importing.\n\n         Special feature:\
  \ \e[1m-csv\e[0m+=\e[4mCSVFILE\e[0m may be used to add items to existing\n     \
  \    lists. This affects only list-type tags. Also applies to the \e[1m-j\e[0m\n\
  \         option.\n\n         Note that this option is fundamentally different than\
  \ all other\n         output format options because it requires information from\
  \ all input\n         files to be buffered in memory before the output is written.\
  \ This may\n         result in excessive memory usage when processing a very large\
  \ number\n         of files with a single command. Also, it makes this option\n\
  \         incompatible with the \e[1m-w\e[0m option. When processing a large number\
  \ of\n         files, it is recommended to either use the JSON (\e[1m-j\e[0m) or\
  \ XML (\e[1m-X\e[0m)\n         output format, or use \e[1m-p\e[0m to generate a\
  \ fixed-column CSV file instead\n         of using the \e[1m-csv\e[0m option.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-d\e[0m \e[4mFMT\e[0m (\e[1m-dateFormat\e[0m)\n         Set the format\
  \ for date/time tag values. The \e[4mFMT\e[0m string may contain\n         formatting\
  \ codes beginning with a percent character (\"%\") to\n         represent the various\
  \ components of a date/time value. The specifics\n         of the \e[4mFMT\e[0m\
  \ syntax are system dependent -- consult the \"strftime\" man\n         page on\
  \ your system for details. The default format is equivalent to\n         \"%Y:%m:%d\
  \ %H:%M:%S\". This option has no effect on date-only or\n         time-only tags\
  \ and ignores timezone information if present. Only one\n         \e[1m-d\e[0m option\
  \ may be used per command. Requires POSIX::strptime or\n         Time::Piece for\
  \ the inversion conversion when writing.\n\n    \e[1m-D\e[0m (\e[1m-decimal\e[0m)\n\
  \         Show tag ID number in decimal when extracting information.\n\n    \e[1m-E\e\
  [0m, \e[1m-ex\e[0m (\e[1m-escapeHTML\e[0m, \e[1m-escapeXML\e[0m)\n         Escape\
  \ characters in output values for HTML (\e[1m-E\e[0m) or XML (\e[1m-ex\e[0m). For\n\
  \         HTML, all characters with Unicode code points above U+007F are\n     \
  \    escaped as well as the following 5 characters: & (&amp;) ' (&#39;) \"\n   \
  \      (&quot;) > (&gt;) and < (&lt;). For XML, only these 5 characters are\n  \
  \       escaped. The \e[1m-E\e[0m option is implied with \e[1m-h\e[0m, and \e[1m-ex\e\
  [0m is implied with\n         \e[1m-X\e[0m. The inverse conversion is applied when\
  \ writing tags.\n\n    \e[1m-f\e[0m (\e[1m-forcePrint\e[0m)\n         Force printing\
  \ of tags even if their values are not found. This\n         option only applies\
  \ when specific tags are requested on the command\n         line (ie. not with wildcards\
  \ or by \"-all\"). With this option, a dash\n         (\"-\") is printed for the\
  \ value of any missing tag, but the dash may\n         be changed via the API MissingTagValue\
  \ option. May also be used to\n         add a 'flags' attribute to the \e[1m-listx\e\
  [0m output, or to allow tags to be\n         deleted when writing with the \e[1m-csv\e\
  [0m=\e[4mCSVFILE\e[0m feature.\n\n    \e[1m-g\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m][:\e[4mNUM\e[0m...]\
  \ (\e[1m-groupHeadings\e[0m)\n         Organize output by tag group. \e[4mNUM\e\
  [0m specifies a group family number,\n         and may be 0 (general location),\
  \ 1 (specific location), 2 (category),\n         3 (document number) or 4 (instance\
  \ number). \e[1m-g0\e[0m is assumed if a\n         family number is not specified,\
  \ and family numbers may be added\n         wherever \e[1m-g\e[0m is mentioned in\
  \ the documentation. Multiple families may\n         be specified by separating\
  \ them with colons. By default the resulting\n         group name is simplified\
  \ by removing any leading \"Main:\" and\n         collapsing adjacent identical\
  \ group names, but this can be avoided by\n         placing a colon before the first\
  \ family number (eg. \e[1m-g:3:1\e[0m). Use the\n         \e[1m-listg\e[0m option\
  \ to list group names for a specified family.\n\n    \e[1m-G\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m][:\e\
  [4mNUM\e[0m...] (\e[1m-groupNames\e[0m)\n         Same as \e[1m-g\e[0m but print\
  \ group name for each tag. \e[1m-G0\e[0m is assumed if\n         \e[4mNUM\e[0m is\
  \ not specified. May be combined with a number of other options\n         to add\
  \ group names to the output. Note that \e[4mNUM\e[0m may be added wherever\n   \
  \      \e[1m-G\e[0m is mentioned in the documentation. See the \e[1m-g\e[0m option\
  \ above for\n         details.\n\n    \e[1m-h\e[0m (\e[1m-htmlFormat\e[0m)\n   \
  \      Use HTML table formatting for output. Implies the \e[1m-E\e[0m option. The\n\
  \         formatting options \e[1m-D\e[0m, \e[1m-H\e[0m, \e[1m-g\e[0m, \e[1m-G\e\
  [0m, \e[1m-l\e[0m and \e[1m-s\e[0m may be used in\n         combination with \e\
  [1m-h\e[0m to influence the HTML format.\n\n    \e[1m-H\e[0m (\e[1m-hex\e[0m)\n\
  \         Show tag ID number in hexadecimal when extracting information.\n\n   \
  \ \e[1m-htmlDump\e[0m[\e[4mOFFSET\e[0m]\n         Generate a dynamic web page containing\
  \ a hex dump of the EXIF\n         information. This can be a very powerful tool\
  \ for low-level analysis\n         of EXIF information. The \e[1m-htmlDump\e[0m\
  \ option is also invoked if the\n         \e[1m-v\e[0m and \e[1m-h\e[0m options\
  \ are used together. The verbose level controls the\n         maximum length of\
  \ the blocks dumped. An \e[4mOFFSET\e[0m may be given to\n         specify the base\
  \ for displayed offsets. If not provided, the\n         EXIF/TIFF base offset is\
  \ used. Use \e[1m-htmlDump0\e[0m for absolute offsets.\n         Currently only\
  \ EXIF/TIFF and JPEG information is dumped, but the -u\n         option can be used\
  \ to give a raw hex dump of other file formats.\n\n    \e[1m-j\e[0m[[+]=\e[4mJSONFILE\e\
  [0m] (\e[1m-json\e[0m)\n         Use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatting\
  \ for console output,\n         or import JSON file if \e[4mJSONFILE\e[0m is specified.\
  \ This option may be\n         combined with \e[1m-g\e[0m to organize the output\
  \ into objects by group, or\n         \e[1m-G\e[0m to add group names to each tag.\
  \ List-type tags with multiple items\n         are output as JSON arrays unless\
  \ \e[1m-sep\e[0m is used. By default XMP\n         structures are flattened into\
  \ individual tags in the JSON output, but\n         the original structure may be\
  \ preserved with the \e[1m-struct\e[0m option (this\n         also causes all list-type\
  \ XMP tags to be output as JSON arrays,\n         otherwise single-item lists would\
  \ be output as simple strings). The\n         \e[1m-a\e[0m option is implied if\
  \ the \e[1m-g\e[0m or \e[1m-G\e[0m options are used, otherwise it\n         is ignored\
  \ and tags with identical JSON names are suppressed.\n         (\e[1m-g4\e[0m may\
  \ be used to ensure that all tags have unique JSON names.)\n         Adding the\
  \ \e[1m-D\e[0m or \e[1m-H\e[0m option changes tag values to JSON objects with\n\
  \         \"val\" and \"id\" fields, and adding \e[1m-l\e[0m adds a \"desc\" field,\
  \ and a \"num\"\n         field if the numerical value is different from the converted\
  \ \"val\".\n         The \e[1m-b\e[0m option may be added to output binary data,\
  \ encoded in base64\n         if necessary (indicated by ASCII \"base64:\" as the\
  \ first 7 bytes of\n         the value), and \e[1m-t\e[0m may be added to include\
  \ tag table information (see\n         \e[1m-t\e[0m for details). The JSON output\
  \ is UTF-8 regardless of any \e[1m-L\e[0m or\n         \e[1m-charset\e[0m option\
  \ setting, but the UTF-8 validation is disabled if a\n         character set other\
  \ than UTF-8 is specified.\n\n         If \e[4mJSONFILE\e[0m is specified, the file\
  \ is imported and the tag\n         definitions from the file are used to set tag\
  \ values on a per-file\n         basis. The special \"SourceFile\" entry in each\
  \ JSON object associates\n         the information with a specific target file.\
  \ An object with a missing\n         SourceFile or a SourceFile of \"*\" defines\
  \ default tags for all target\n         files which are combined with any tags specified\
  \ for the specific\n         SourceFile processed. The imported JSON file must have\
  \ the same\n         format as the exported JSON files with the exception that the\
  \ \e[1m-g\e[0m\n         option is not compatible with the import file format (use\
  \ \e[1m-G\e[0m\n         instead). Additionally, tag names in the input JSON file\
  \ may be\n         suffixed with a \"#\" to disable print conversion.\n\n      \
  \   Unlike CSV import, empty values are not ignored, and will cause an\n       \
  \  empty value to be written if supported by the specific metadata type.\n     \
  \    Tags are deleted by using the \e[1m-f\e[0m option and setting the tag value\
  \ to\n         \"-\" (or to the MissingTagValue setting if this API option was used).\n\
  \         Importing with \e[1m-j\e[0m+=\e[4mJSONFILE\e[0m causes new values to be\
  \ added to existing\n         lists.\n\n    \e[1m-l\e[0m (\e[1m-long\e[0m)\n   \
  \      Use long 2-line Canon-style output format. Adds a description and\n     \
  \    unconverted value (if it is different from the converted value) to\n      \
  \   the XML, JSON or PHP output when \e[1m-X\e[0m, \e[1m-j\e[0m or \e[1m-php\e[0m\
  \ is used. May also be\n         combined with \e[1m-listf\e[0m, \e[1m-listr\e[0m\
  \ or \e[1m-listwf\e[0m to add descriptions of the\n         file types.\n\n    \e\
  [1m-L\e[0m (\e[1m-latin\e[0m)\n         Use Windows Latin1 encoding (cp1252) for\
  \ output tag values instead of\n         the default UTF-8. When writing, \e[1m-L\e\
  [0m specifies that input text values\n         are Latin1 instead of UTF-8. Equivalent\
  \ to \"-charset latin\".\n\n    \e[1m-lang\e[0m [\e[4mLANG\e[0m]\n         Set current\
  \ language for tag descriptions and converted values.\n         \e[4mLANG\e[0m is\
  \ \"de\", \"fr\", \"ja\", etc. Use \e[1m-lang\e[0m with no other arguments to\n\
  \         get a list of available languages. The default language is \"en\" if\n\
  \         \e[1m-lang\e[0m is not specified. Note that tag/group names are always\
  \ English,\n         independent of the \e[1m-lang\e[0m setting, and translation\
  \ of warning/error\n         messages has not yet been implemented. May also be\
  \ combined with\n         \e[1m-listx\e[0m to output descriptions in one language\
  \ only.\n\n         By default, ExifTool uses UTF-8 encoding for special characters,\
  \ but\n         the the \e[1m-L\e[0m or \e[1m-charset\e[0m option may be used to\
  \ invoke other encodings.\n\n         Currently, the language support is not complete,\
  \ but users are\n         welcome to help improve this by submitting their own translations.\
  \ To\n         submit a set of translations, first use the \e[1m-listx\e[0m option\
  \ and\n         redirect the output to a file to generate an XML tag database, then\n\
  \         add entries for other languages, zip this file, and email it to phil\n\
  \         at owl.phy.queensu.ca for inclusion in ExifTool.\n\n         Note: ExifTool\
  \ uses Unicode::LineBreak if available to help preserve\n         the column alignment\
  \ of the plain text output for languages with a\n         variable-width character\
  \ set.\n\n    \e[1m-listItem\e[0m \e[4mINDEX\e[0m\n         For list-type tags,\
  \ this causes only the item with the specified\n         index to be extracted.\
  \ \e[4mINDEX\e[0m is 0 for the first item in the list.\n         Negative indices\
  \ may also be used to reference items from the end of\n         the list. Has no\
  \ effect on single-valued tags. Also applies to tag\n         values when copying\
  \ from a tag, and in \e[1m-if\e[0m conditions.\n\n    \e[1m-n\e[0m (\e[1m--printConv\e\
  [0m)\n         Disable print conversion for all tags. By default, extracted values\n\
  \         are converted to a more human-readable format, but the \e[1m-n\e[0m option\n\
  \         disables this conversion, revealing the machine-readable values. For\n\
  \         example:\n\n             > exiftool -Orientation -S a.jpg\n          \
  \   Orientation: Rotate 90 CW\n             > exiftool -Orientation -S -n a.jpg\n\
  \             Orientation: 6\n\n         The print conversion may also be disabled\
  \ on a per-tag basis by\n         suffixing the tag name with a \"#\" character:\n\
  \n             > exiftool -Orientation# -Orientation -S a.jpg\n             Orientation:\
  \ 6\n             Orientation: Rotate 90 CW\n\n         These techniques may also\
  \ be used to disable the inverse print\n         conversion when writing. For example,\
  \ the following commands all have\n         the same effect:\n\n             > exiftool\
  \ -Orientation='Rotate 90 CW' a.jpg\n             > exiftool -Orientation=6 -n a.jpg\n\
  \             > exiftool -Orientation#=6 a.jpg\n\n    \e[1m-p\e[0m \e[4mFMTFILE\e\
  [0m or \e[4mSTR\e[0m (\e[1m-printFormat\e[0m)\n         Print output in the format\
  \ specified by the given file or string. The\n         argument is interpreted as\
  \ a string unless a file of that name\n         exists, in which case the string\
  \ is loaded from the contents of the\n         file. Tag names in the format file\
  \ or string begin with a \"$\" symbol\n         and may contain a leading group\
  \ names and/or a trailing \"#\". Case is\n         not significant. Braces \"{}\"\
  \ may be used around the tag name to\n         separate it from subsequent text.\
  \ Use $$ to represent a \"$\" symbol,\n         and $/ for a newline.\n\n      \
  \   Multiple \e[1m-p\e[0m options may be used, each contributing a line (or more)\n\
  \         of text to the output. Lines beginning with \"#[HEAD]\" and \"#[TAIL]\"\
  \n         are output before the first processed file and after the last\n     \
  \    processed file respectively. Lines beginning with \"#[SECT]\" and\n       \
  \  \"#[ENDS]\" are output around each section of files. A section is\n         defined\
  \ as a group of consecutive files with the same section header\n         (eg. files\
  \ are grouped by directory if \"#[SECT]\" contains\n         $directory). Lines\
  \ beginning with \"#[BODY]\" and lines not beginning\n         with \"#\" are output\
  \ for each processed file. Lines beginning with\n         \"#[IF]\" are not output,\
  \ but all BODY lines are skipped if any tag on\n         an IF line doesn't exist.\
  \ Other lines beginning with \"#\" are ignored.\n         For example, this format\
  \ file:\n\n             # this is a comment line\n             #[HEAD]-- Generated\

  \ tags to '-' (but this may be\n         configured via the MissingTagValue API\
  \ option), or the \e[1m-m\e[0m option may\n         be used to ignore minor warnings\
  \ and leave the missing values empty.\n         Alternatively, \e[1m-q -q\e[0m may\
  \ be used to simply suppress the warning\n         messages.\n\n         The \"\
  Advanced formatting feature\" may be used to modify the values of\n         individual\
  \ tags with the \e[1m-p\e[0m option.\n\n    \e[1m-php\e[0m Format output as a PHP\
  \ Array. The \e[1m-g\e[0m, \e[1m-G\e[0m, \e[1m-D\e[0m, \e[1m-H\e[0m, \e[1m-l\e[0m,\
  \ \e[1m-sep\e[0m and\n         \e[1m-struct\e[0m options combine with \e[1m-php\e\
  [0m, and duplicate tags are handled in\n         the same way as with the \e[1m-json\e\
  [0m option. As well, the \e[1m-b\e[0m option may be\n         added to output binary\
  \ data, and \e[1m-t\e[0m may be added to include tag table\n         information\
  \ (see \e[1m-t\e[0m for details). Here is a simple example showing\n         how\
  \ this could be used in a PHP script:\n\n             <?php\n             eval('$array='\
  \ . `exiftool -php -q image.jpg`);\n             print_r($array);\n            \
  \ ?>\n\n    \e[1m-s\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m] (\e[1m-short\e[0m)\n         Short output\
  \ format. Prints tag names instead of descriptions. Add\n         \e[4mNUM\e[0m\
  \ or up to 3 \e[1m-s\e[0m options for even shorter formats:\n\n             -s1\
  \ or -s        - print tag names instead of descriptions\n             -s2 or -s\
  \ -s     - no extra spaces to column-align values\n             -s3 or -s -s -s\
  \  - print values only (no tag names)\n\n         Also effective when combined with\
  \ \e[1m-t\e[0m, \e[1m-h\e[0m, \e[1m-X\e[0m or \e[1m-listx\e[0m options.\n\n    \e\
  [1m-S\e[0m (\e[1m-veryShort\e[0m)\n         Very short format. The same as \e[1m-s2\e\
  [0m or two \e[1m-s\e[0m options. Tag names are\n         printed instead of descriptions,\
  \ and no extra spaces are added to\n         column-align values.\n\n    \e[1m-sep\e\
  [0m \e[4mSTR\e[0m (\e[1m-separator\e[0m)\n         Specify separator string for\
  \ items in list-type tags. When reading,\n         the default is to join list items\
  \ with \", \". When writing, this\n         option causes values assigned to list-type\
  \ tags to be split into\n         individual items at each substring matching \e\
  [4mSTR\e[0m (otherwise they are\n         not split by default). Space characters\
  \ in \e[4mSTR\e[0m match zero or more\n         whitespace characters in the value.\n\
  \n         Note that an empty separator (\"\") is allowed, and will join items\n\
  \         with no separator when reading, or split the value into individual\n \
  \        characters when writing.\n\n         For pure binary output (\e[1m-b\e\
  [0m used without \e[1m-j\e[0m, \e[1m-php\e[0m or \e[1m-X\e[0m), the first\n    \
  \     \e[1m-sep\e[0m option specifies a list-item separator, and a second \e[1m-sep\e\
  [0m option\n         specifies a terminator for the end of the list (or after each\
  \ value\n         if not a list). In these strings, \"\\n\", \"\\r\" and \"\\t\"\
  \ may be used to\n         represent a newline, carriage return and tab respectively.\
  \ By\n         default, binary list items are separated by a newline, and no\n \
  \        terminator is added.\n\n    \e[1m-sort\e[0m, \e[1m--sort\e[0m\n       \
  \  Sort output by tag description, or by tag name if the \e[1m-s\e[0m option is\n\
  \         used. When sorting by description, the sort order will depend on the\n\
  \         \e[1m-lang\e[0m option setting. Without the \e[1m-sort\e[0m option, tags\
  \ appear in the\n         order they were specified on the command line, or if not\
  \ specified,\n         the order they were extracted from the file. By default,\
  \ tags are\n         organized by groups when combined with the \e[1m-g\e[0m or\
  \ \e[1m-G\e[0m option, but this\n         grouping may be disabled with \e[1m--sort\e\
  [0m.\n\n    \e[1m-struct\e[0m, \e[1m--struct\e[0m\n         Output structured XMP\
  \ information instead of flattening to individual\n         tags. This option works\
  \ well when combined with the XML (\e[1m-X\e[0m) and JSON\n         (\e[1m-j\e[0m)\
  \ output formats. For other output formats, XMP structures and\n         lists are\
  \ serialized into the same format as when writing structured\n         information\
  \ (see\n         <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/struct.html> for details).\n\
  \         When copying, structured tags are copied by default unless\n         \e\
  [1m--struct\e[0m is used to disable this feature (although flattened tags may\n\
  \         still be copied by specifying them individually unless \e[1m-struct\e\
  [0m is\n         used). These options have no effect when assigning new values since\n\
  \         both flattened and structured tags may always be used when writing.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-t\e[0m (\e[1m-tab\e[0m)\n         Output a tab-delimited list of description/values\
  \ (useful for\n         database import). May be combined with \e[1m-s\e[0m to print\
  \ tag names instead\n         of descriptions, or \e[1m-S\e[0m to print tag values\
  \ only, tab-delimited on a\n         single line. The \e[1m-t\e[0m option may be\
  \ combined with \e[1m-j\e[0m, \e[1m-php\e[0m or \e[1m-X\e[0m to add\n         tag\
  \ table information (\"table\", tag \"id\", and \"index\" for cases where\n    \
  \     multiple conditional tags exist with the same ID).\n\n    \e[1m-T\e[0m (\e\
  [1m-table\e[0m)\n         Output tag values in table form. Equivalent to \e[1m-t\
  \ -S -q -f\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-v\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m] (\e[1m-verbose\e[0m)\n     \
  \    Print verbose messages. \e[4mNUM\e[0m specifies the level of verbosity in the\n\
  \         range 0-5, with higher numbers being more verbose. If \e[4mNUM\e[0m is\
  \ not\n         given, then each \e[1m-v\e[0m option increases the level of verbosity\
  \ by 1.\n         With any level greater than 0, most other options are ignored\
  \ and\n         normal console output is suppressed unless specific tags are\n \
  \        extracted. Using \e[1m-v0\e[0m causes the console output buffer to be flushed\n\
  \         after each line (which may be useful to avoid delays when piping\n   \
  \      exiftool output), and prints the name of each processed file when\n     \
  \    writing. Also see the \e[1m-progress\e[0m option.\n\n    \e[1m-w\e[0m[+|!]\
  \ \e[4mEXT\e[0m or \e[4mFMT\e[0m (\e[1m-textOut\e[0m)\n         Write console output\
  \ to files with names ending in \e[4mEXT\e[0m, one for each\n         source file.\
  \ The output file name is obtained by replacing the source\n         file extension\
  \ (including the '.') with the specified extension (and\n         a '.' is added\
  \ to the start of \e[4mEXT\e[0m if it doesn't already contain\n         one). Alternatively,\
  \ a \e[4mFMT\e[0m string may be used to give more control\n         over the output\
  \ file name and directory. In the format string, %d, %f\n         and %e represent\
  \ the directory, filename and extension of the source\n         file, and %c represents\
  \ a copy number which is automatically\n         incremented if the file already\
  \ exists. %d includes the trailing '/'\n         if necessary, but %e does not include\
  \ the leading '.'. For example:\n\n             -w %d%f.txt       # same effect\
  \ as \"-w txt\"\n             -w dir/%f_%e.out  # write files to \"dir\" as \"FILE_EXT.out\"\
  \n             -w dir2/%d%f.txt  # write to \"dir2\", keeping dir structure\n  \
  \           -w a%c.txt        # write to \"a.txt\" or \"a1.txt\" or \"a2.txt\"...\n\
  \n         Existing files will not be changed unless an exclamation point is\n \
  \        added to the option name (ie. \e[1m-w!\e[0m or \e[1m-textOut!\e[0m) to\
  \ overwrite the\n         file, or a plus sign (ie. \e[1m-w+\e[0m or \e[1m-textOut+\e\
  [0m) to append to the existing\n         file. Both may be used (ie. \e[1m-w+!\e\
  [0m or \e[1m-textOut+!\e[0m) to overwrite output\n         files that didn't exist\
  \ before the command was run, and append the\n         output from multiple source\
  \ files. For example, to write one output\n         file for all source files in\
  \ each directory:\n\n             exiftool -filename -createdate -T -w+! %d/out.txt\
  \ -r DIR\n\n         Capitalized format codes %D, %F, %E and %C provide slightly\
  \ different\n         alternatives to the lower case versions. %D does not include\
  \ the\n         trailing '/', %F is the full filename including extension, %E\n\
  \         includes the leading '.', and %C increments the count for each\n     \
  \    processed file (see below).\n\n         Notes:\n\n         1) In a Windows\
  \ BAT file the \"%\" character is represented by \"%%\", so\n         an argument\
  \ like \"%d%f.txt\" is written as \"%%d%%f.txt\".\n\n         2) If the argument\
  \ for \e[1m-w\e[0m does not contain a valid format code (eg.\n         %f), then\
  \ it is interpreted as a file extension. It is not possible\n         to specify\
  \ a simple filename as an argument -- creating a single\n         output file from\
  \ multiple source files is typically done by shell\n         redirection, ie)\n\n\
  \             exiftool FILE1 FILE2 ... > out.txt\n\n         But if necessary, an\
  \ empty format code may be used to force the\n         argument to be interpreted\
  \ as a format string, and the same result\n         may be obtained without the\
  \ use of shell redirection:\n\n             exiftool -w+! %0fout.txt FILE1 FILE2\
  \ ...\n\n         Advanced features:\n\n         A substring of the original file\
  \ name, directory or extension may be\n         taken by specifying a field width\
  \ immediately following the '%'\n         character. If the width is negative, the\
  \ substring is taken from the\n         end. The substring position (characters\
  \ to ignore at the start or end\n         of the string) may be given by a second\
  \ optional value after a\n         decimal point. For example:\n\n             Input\
  \ File Name     Format Specifier    Output File Name\n             ----------------\
  \    ----------------    ----------------\n             Picture-123.jpg     %7f.txt\
  \             Picture.txt\n             Picture-123.jpg     %-.4f.out          \
  \ Picture.out\n             Picture-123.jpg     %7f.%-3f            Picture.123\n\
  \             Picture-123a.jpg    Meta%-3.1f.txt      Meta123.txt\n\n         (Note\
  \ that special characters may have a width of greater than one.)\n\n         For\
  \ %d and %D, the field width/position specifiers may be applied to\n         the\
  \ directory levels instead of substring position by using a colon\n         instead\
  \ of a decimal point in the format specifier. For example:\n\n             Source\
  \ Dir     Format   Result       Notes\n             ------------   ------   ----------\
  \   ------------------\n             pics/2012/02   %2:d     pics/2012/   take top\
  \ 2 levels\n             pics/2012/02   %-:1d    pics/2012/   up one directory level\n\
  \             pics/2012/02   %:1d     2012/02/     ignore top level\n          \
  \   pics/2012/02   %1:1d    2012/        take 1 level after top\n             pics/2012/02\
  \   %-1:D    02           bottom level folder name\n             /Users/phil   \
  \ %:2d     phil/        ignore top 2 levels\n\n         (Note that the root directory\
  \ counts as one level when an absolute\n         path is used as in the last example\
  \ above.)\n\n         For %c, these modifiers have a different effects. If a field\
  \ width is\n         given, the copy number is padded with zeros to the specified\
  \ width. A\n         leading '-' adds a dash before the copy number, and a '+' adds\
  \ an\n         underline. By default, the copy number is omitted from the first\
  \ file\n         of a given name, but this can be changed by adding a decimal point\
  \ to\n         the modifier. For example:\n\n             -w A%-cZ.txt      # AZ.txt,\
  \ A-1Z.txt, A-2Z.txt ...\n             -w B%5c.txt       # B.txt, B00001.txt, B00002.txt\
  \ ...\n             -w C%.c.txt       # C0.txt, C1.txt, C2.txt ...\n           \
  \  -w D%-.c.txt      # D-0.txt, D-1.txt, D-2.txt ...\n             -w E%-.4c.txt\
  \     # E-0000.txt, E-0001.txt, E-0002.txt ...\n             -w F%-.4nc.txt    #\
  \ F-0001.txt, F-0002.txt, F-0003.txt ...\n             -w G%+c.txt       # G.txt,\
  \ G_1.txt G_2.txt ...\n             -w H%-lc.txt      # H.txt, H-b.txt, H-c.txt\
  \ ...\n             -w I.%.3uc.txt    # I.AAA.txt, I.AAB.txt, I.AAC.txt ...\n\n\
  \         A special feature allows the copy number to be incremented for each\n\
  \         processed file by using %C (upper case) instead of %c. This allows a\n\
  \         sequential number to be added to output file names, even if the names\n\
  \         are different. For %C, a copy number of zero is not omitted as it is\n\
  \         with %c. A leading '-' causes the number to be reset at the start of\n\
  \         each new directory, and '+' has no effect. The number before the\n   \
  \      decimal place gives the starting index, the number after the decimal\n  \
  \       place gives the field width. The following examples show the output\n  \
  \       filenames when used with the command \"exiftool rose.jpg star.jpg\n    \
  \     jet.jpg ...\":\n\n             -w %C%f.txt       # 0rose.txt, 1star.txt, 2jet.txt\n\
  \             -w %f-%10C.txt    # rose-10.txt, star-11.txt, jet-12.txt\n       \
  \      -w %.3C-%f.txt    # 000-rose.txt, 001-star.txt, 002-jet.txt\n           \
  \  -w %57.4C%f.txt   # 0057rose.txt, 0058star.txt, 0059jet.txt\n\n         All format\
  \ codes may be modified by 'l' or 'u' to specify lower or\n         upper case respectively\
  \ (ie. %le for a lower case file extension).\n         When used to modify %c or\
  \ %C, the numbers are changed to an\n         alphabetical base (see example H above).\
  \ Also, %c and %C may be\n         modified by 'n' to count using natural numbers\
  \ starting from 1,\n         instead of 0 (see example F above).\n\n         This\
  \ same \e[4mFMT\e[0m syntax is used with the \e[1m-o\e[0m and \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e\
  [0m options,\n         although %c and %C are only valid for output file names.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-W\e[0m[+|!] \e[4mFMT\e[0m (\e[1m-tagOut\e[0m)\n         This enhanced\
  \ version of the \e[1m-w\e[0m option allows a separate output file\n         to\
  \ be created for each extracted tag. See the \e[1m-w\e[0m option documentation\n\
  \         above for details of the basic functionality. Listed here are the\n  \
  \       differences between \e[1m-W\e[0m and \e[1m-w\e[0m:\n\n         1) With \e\
  [1m-W\e[0m, a new output file is created for each extracted tag.\n\n         2)\
  \ \e[1m-W\e[0m supports three additional format codes: %t, %g and %s represent\n\
  \         the tag name, group name, and suggested extension for the output file\n\
  \         (based on the format of the data). The %g code may be followed by a\n\
  \         single digit to specify the group family number (eg. %g1), otherwise\n\
  \         family 0 is assumed. The substring width/position/case specifiers may\n\
  \         be used with these format codes in exactly the same way as with %f\n \
  \        and %e.\n\n         3) The argument for \e[1m-W\e[0m is interpreted as\
  \ a file name if it contains\n         no format codes. (For \e[1m-w\e[0m, this\
  \ would be a file extension.) This\n         change allows a simple file name to\
  \ be specified, which, when\n         combined with the append feature, provides\
  \ a method to write metadata\n         from multiple source files to a single output\
  \ file without the need\n         for shell redirection. For example, the following\
  \ pairs of commands\n         give the same result:\n\n             # overwriting\
  \ existing text file\n             exiftool test.jpg > out.txt     # shell redirection\n\
  \             exiftool test.jpg -W+! out.txt  # equivalent -W option\n\n       \
  \      # append to existing text file\n             exiftool test.jpg >> out.txt\
  \    # shell redirection\n             exiftool test.jpg -W+ out.txt   # equivalent\
  \ -W option\n\n         4) Adding the \e[1m-v\e[0m option to \e[1m-W\e[0m sends\
  \ a list of the tags and output\n         file names to the console instead of giving\
  \ a verbose dump of the\n         entire file. (Unless appending all output to one\
  \ file for each source\n         file by using \e[1m-W+\e[0m with an output file\
  \ \e[4mFMT\e[0m that does not contain %t,\n         $g or %s.)\n\n         5) Individual\
  \ list items are stored in separate files when \e[1m-W\e[0m is\n         combined\
  \ with \e[1m-b\e[0m, but note that for separate files to be created %c\n       \
  \  or %C must be used in \e[4mFMT\e[0m to give the files unique names.\n\n    \e\
  [1m-Wext\e[0m \e[4mEXT\e[0m, \e[1m--Wext\e[0m \e[4mEXT\e[0m (\e[1m-tagOutExt\e[0m)\n\
  \         This option is used to specify the type of output file(s) written by\n\
  \         the \e[1m-W\e[0m option. An output file is written only if the suggested\n\
  \         extension matches \e[4mEXT\e[0m. Multiple \e[1m-Wext\e[0m options may\
  \ be used to write\n         more than one type of file. Use \e[1m--Wext\e[0m to\

  [0m)\n         Use ExifTool-specific RDF/XML formatting for console output. Implies\n\
  \         the \e[1m-a\e[0m option, so duplicate tags are extracted. The formatting\n\
  \         options \e[1m-b\e[0m, \e[1m-D\e[0m, \e[1m-H\e[0m, \e[1m-l\e[0m, \e[1m-s\e\
  [0m, \e[1m-sep\e[0m, \e[1m-struct\e[0m and \e[1m-t\e[0m may be used in\n       \
  \  combination with \e[1m-X\e[0m to affect the output, but note that the tag ID\n\
  \         (\e[1m-D\e[0m, \e[1m-H\e[0m and \e[1m-t\e[0m), binary data (\e[1m-b\e\
  [0m) and structured output (\e[1m-struct\e[0m)\n         options are not effective\
  \ for the short output (\e[1m-s\e[0m). Another\n         restriction of \e[1m-s\e\
  [0m is that only one tag with a given group and name\n         may appear in the\
  \ output. Note that the tag ID options (\e[1m-D\e[0m, \e[1m-H\e[0m and\n       \
  \  \e[1m-t\e[0m) will produce non-standard RDF/XML unless the \e[1m-l\e[0m option\
  \ is also\n         used.\n\n         By default, \e[1m-X\e[0m outputs flattened\
  \ tags, so \e[1m-struct\e[0m should be added if\n         required to preserve XMP\
  \ structures. List-type tags with multiple\n         values are formatted as an\
  \ RDF Bag, but they are combined into a\n         single string when \e[1m-s\e[0m\
  \ or \e[1m-sep\e[0m is used. Using \e[1m-L\e[0m changes the XML\n         encoding\
  \ from \"UTF-8\" to \"windows-1252\". Other \e[1m-charset\e[0m settings\n      \
  \   change the encoding only if there is a corresponding standard XML\n        \
  \ character set. The \e[1m-b\e[0m option causes binary data values to be written,\n\
  \         encoded in base64 if necessary. The \e[1m-t\e[0m option adds tag table\n\
  \         information to the output (see \e[1m-t\e[0m for details).\n\n        \
  \ Note: This output is NOT the same as XMP because it uses\n         dynamically-generated\
  \ property names corresponding to the ExifTool\n         tag names, and not the\
  \ standard XMP properties. To write XMP instead,\n         use the \e[1m-o\e[0m\
  \ option with an XMP extension for the output file.\n\n   Processing control\n \

  [0m to identify the originating document for extracted\n         information. Embedded\

  \ \e[4mEXT\e[0m\n    (\e[1m-extension\e[0m)\n         Process only files with (\e\
  [1m-ext\e[0m) or without (\e[1m--ext\e[0m) a specified\n         extension. There\
  \ may be multiple \e[1m-ext\e[0m and \e[1m--ext\e[0m options. A plus sign\n    \
  \     may be added (ie. \e[1m-ext+\e[0m) to add the specified extension to the\n\
  \         normally processed files. EXT may begin with a leading '.', which is\n\
  \         ignored. Case is not significant. \"*\" may be used to process files\n\
  \         with any extension (or none at all), as in the last three examples:\n\n\
  \             exiftool -ext JPG DIR             # process only JPG files\n     \
  \        exiftool --ext cr2 --ext dng DIR  # supported files but CR2/DNG\n     \
  \        exiftool -ext+ txt DIR            # supported files plus TXT\n        \
  \     exiftool -ext \"*\" DIR             # process all files\n             exiftool\
  \ -ext \"*\" --ext xml DIR   # process all but XML files\n             exiftool\
  \ -ext \"*\" --ext . DIR     # all but those with no ext\n\n         Using this\
  \ option has two main advantages over specifying \"*.\e[4mEXT\e[0m\" on\n      \
  \   the command line: 1) It applies to files in subdirectories when\n         combined\
  \ with the \e[1m-r\e[0m option. 2) The \e[1m-ext\e[0m option is case-insensitive,\n\
  \         which is useful when processing files on case-sensitive filesystems.\n\
  \n         Note that all files specified on the command line will be processed\n\
  \         regardless of extension unless the \e[1m-ext\e[0m option is used.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-F\e[0m[\e[4mOFFSET\e[0m] (\e[1m-fixBase\e[0m)\n         Fix the base\
  \ for maker notes offsets. A common problem with some\n         image editors is\
  \ that offsets in the maker notes are not adjusted\n         properly when the file\
  \ is modified. This may cause the wrong values\n         to be extracted for some\
  \ maker note entries when reading the edited\n         file. This option allows\
  \ an integer \e[4mOFFSET\e[0m to be specified for\n         adjusting the maker\
  \ notes base offset. If no \e[4mOFFSET\e[0m is given,\n         ExifTool takes its\
  \ best guess at the correct base. Note that exiftool\n         will automatically\
  \ fix the offsets for images which store original\n         offset information (eg.\
  \ newer Canon models). Offsets are fixed\n         permanently if \e[1m-F\e[0m is\
  \ used when writing EXIF to an image. eg)\n\n             exiftool -F -exif:resolutionunit=inches\
  \ image.jpg\n\n    \e[1m-fast\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m]\n         Increase speed of extracting\
  \ information. With this option, ExifTool\n         will not scan to the end of\
  \ a JPEG image to check for an AFCP or\n         PreviewImage trailer, or past the\
  \ first comment in GIF images or the\n         audio/video data in WAV/AVI files\
  \ to search for additional metadata.\n         These speed benefits are small when\
  \ reading images directly from\n         disk, but can be substantial if piping\
  \ images through a network\n         connection. For more substantial speed benefits,\
  \ \e[1m-fast2\e[0m also causes\n         exiftool to avoid extracting any EXIF MakerNote\
  \ information.\n         \e[1m-fast3\e[0m avoids extracting metadata from the file,\
  \ and returns only\n         pseudo System tags, but still reads the file header\
  \ to obtain an\n         educated guess at FileType. \e[1m-fast4\e[0m doesn't even\
  \ read the file header,\n         and determines FileType based only on the file\
  \ extension. Has no\n         effect when writing.\n\n    \e[1m-fileOrder\e[0m [-]\e\
  [4mTAG\e[0m\n         Set file processing order according to the sorted value of\
  \ the\n         specified \e[4mTAG\e[0m. For example, to process files in order\
  \ of date:\n\n             exiftool -fileOrder DateTimeOriginal DIR\n\n        \
  \ Additional \e[1m-fileOrder\e[0m options may be added for secondary sort keys.\n\
  \         Numbers are sorted numerically, and all other values are sorted\n    \
  \     alphabetically. The sort order may be reversed by prefixing the tag\n    \
  \     name with a \"-\" (eg. \"-fileOrder -createdate\"). Print conversion of\n\
  \         the sorted values is disabled with the \e[1m-n\e[0m option, or a \"#\"\
  \ appended\n         to the tag name. Other formatting options (eg. \e[1m-d\e[0m)\
  \ have no effect on\n         the sorted values. Note that the \e[1m-fileOrder\e\
  [0m option has a large\n         performance impact since it involves an additional\
  \ processing pass of\n         each file.\n\n    \e[1m-i\e[0m \e[4mDIR\e[0m (\e\
  [1m-ignore\e[0m)\n         Ignore specified directory name. \e[4mDIR\e[0m may be\
  \ either an individual\n         folder name, or a full path. If a full path is\
  \ specified, it must\n         match the Directory tag exactly to be ignored. Use\
  \ multiple \e[1m-i\e[0m\n         options to ignore more than one directory name.\
  \ A special \e[4mDIR\e[0m value\n         of \"SYMLINKS\" (case sensitive) may be\
  \ specified to ignore symbolic\n         links when the \e[1m-r\e[0m option is used.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-if\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m] \e[4mEXPR\e[0m\n         Specify a condition\
  \ to be evaluated before processing each \e[4mFILE\e[0m.\n         \e[4mEXPR\e[0m\
  \ is a Perl-like logic expression containing tag names prefixed by\n         \"\
  $\" symbols. It is evaluated with the tags from each \e[4mFILE\e[0m in turn,\n \
  \        and the file is processed only if the expression returns true. Unlike\n\
  \         Perl variable names, tag names are not case sensitive and may contain\n\
  \         a hyphen. As well, tag names may have a leading group names separated\n\
  \         by colons, and/or a trailing \"#\" character to disable print\n      \
  \   conversion. The expression $GROUP:all evaluates to 1 if any tag\n         exists\
  \ in the specified \"GROUP\", or 0 otherwise (see note 2 below).\n         When\
  \ multiple \e[1m-if\e[0m options are used, all conditions must be satisfied\n  \
  \       to process the file. Returns an exit status of 2 if all files fail\n   \
  \      the condition. Below are a few examples:\n\n             # extract shutterspeed\
  \ from all Canon images in a directory\n             exiftool -shutterspeed -if\
  \ '$make eq \"Canon\"' dir\n\n             # add one hour to all images created\
  \ on or after Apr. 2, 2006\n             exiftool -alldates+=1 -if '$CreateDate\
  \ ge \"2006:04:02\"' dir\n\n             # set EXIF ISO value if possible, unless\
  \ it is set already\n             exiftool '-exif:iso<iso' -if 'not $exif:iso' dir\n\
  \n             # find images containing a specific keyword (case insensitive)\n\
  \             exiftool -if '$keywords =~ /harvey/i' -filename dir\n\n         Adding\
  \ \e[4mNUM\e[0m to the \e[1m-if\e[0m option causes a separate processing pass to\
  \ be\n         executed for evaluating \e[4mEXPR\e[0m at a \e[1m-fast\e[0m level\
  \ given by \e[4mNUM\e[0m (see the\n         \e[1m-fast\e[0m option documentation\
  \ for details). Without \e[4mNUM\e[0m, only one\n         processing pass is done\
  \ at the level specified by the \e[1m-fast\e[0m option.\n         For example, using\
  \ \e[1m-if4\e[0m is possible if \e[4mEXPR\e[0m uses only pseudo System\n       \
  \  tags, and may significantly speed processing if enough files fail the\n     \
  \    condition.\n\n         Notes:\n\n         1) The \e[1m-n\e[0m and \e[1m-b\e\
  [0m options also apply to tags used in \e[4mEXPR\e[0m.\n\n         2) Some binary\
  \ data blocks are not extracted unless specified\n         explicitly. These tags\
  \ are not available for use in the \e[1m-if\e[0m condition\n         unless they\
  \ are also specified on the command line. The alternative\n         is to use the\
  \ $GROUP:all syntax. (eg. Use $exif:all instead of $exif\n         in \e[4mEXPR\e\
  [0m to test for the existence of EXIF tags.)\n\n         3) Tags in the string are\
  \ interpolated the same way as with \e[1m-p\e[0m before\n         the expression\
  \ is evaluated. In this interpolation, $/ is converted\n         to a newline and\
  \ $$ represents a single \"$\" symbol (so Perl\n         variables, if used, require\
  \ a double \"$\").\n\n         4) The condition may only test tags from the file\
  \ being processed. To\n         process one file based on tags from another, two\
  \ steps are required.\n         For example, to process XMP sidecar files in directory\
  \ \"DIR\" based on\n         tags from the associated NEF:\n\n             exiftool\
  \ -if EXPR -p '$directory/$filename' -ext nef DIR > nef.txt\n             exiftool\
  \ -@ nef.txt -srcfile %d%f.xmp ...\n\n         5) The \e[1m-a\e[0m option has no\
  \ effect on the evaluation of the expression,\n         and the values of duplicate\
  \ tags are accessible only by specifying a\n         group name (such as a family\
  \ 4 instance number, eg. $Copy1:TAG,\n         $Copy2:TAG, etc).\n\n         6)\
  \ A special \"OK\" UserParam is available to test the success of the\n         previous\
  \ command when \e[1m-execute\e[0m was used, and may be used like any\n         other\
  \ tag in the condition (ie. \"$OK\").\n\n    \e[1m-m\e[0m (\e[1m-ignoreMinorErrors\e\
  [0m)\n         Ignore minor errors and warnings. This enables writing to files with\n\
  \         minor errors and disables some validation checks which could result\n\
  \         in minor warnings. Generally, minor errors/warnings indicate a\n     \
  \    problem which usually won't result in loss of metadata if ignored.\n      \
  \   However, there are exceptions, so ExifTool leaves it up to you to\n        \
  \ make the final decision. Minor errors and warnings are indicated by\n        \
  \ \"[minor]\" at the start of the message. Warnings which affect\n         processing\
  \ when ignored are indicated by \"[Minor]\" (with a capital\n         \"M\"). Note\
  \ that this causes missing values in \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m, \e[1m-p\e[0m and\n\
  \         \e[1m-if\e[0m strings to be set to an empty string rather than an undefined\n\
  \         value.\n\n    \e[1m-o\e[0m \e[4mOUTFILE\e[0m or \e[4mFMT\e[0m (\e[1m-out\e\
  [0m)\n         Set the output file or directory name when writing information.\n\
  \         Without this option, when any \"real\" tags are written the original\n\
  \         file is renamed to \"FILE_original\" and output is written to \e[4mFILE\e\
  [0m.\n         When writing only FileName and/or Directory \"pseudo\" tags, \e[1m-o\e\
  [0m causes\n         the file to be copied instead of moved, but directories specified\
  \ for\n         either of these tags take precedence over that specified by the\n\
  \         \e[1m-o\e[0m option.\n\n         \e[4mOUTFILE\e[0m may be \"-\" to write\
  \ to stdout. The output file name may also\n         be specified using a \e[4mFMT\e\
  [0m string in which %d, %f and %e represent the\n         directory, file name and\
  \ extension of \e[4mFILE\e[0m. Also, %c may be used to\n         add a copy number.\
  \ See the \e[1m-w\e[0m option for \e[4mFMT\e[0m string examples.\n\n         The\
  \ output file is taken to be a directory name if it already exists\n         as\
  \ a directory or if the name ends with '/'. Output directories are\n         created\
  \ if necessary. Existing files will not be overwritten.\n         Combining the\
  \ \e[1m-overwrite_original\e[0m option with \e[1m-o\e[0m causes the original\n \
  \        source file to be erased after the output file is successfully\n      \
  \   written.\n\n         A special feature of this option allows the creation of\
  \ certain types\n         of files from scratch, or with the metadata from another\
  \ type of\n         file. The following file types may be created using this technique:\n\
  \n             XMP, EXIF, EXV, MIE, ICC/ICM, VRD, DR4\n\n         The output file\
  \ type is determined by the extension of \e[4mOUTFILE\e[0m\n         (specified\
  \ as \"-.EXT\" when writing to stdout). The output file is\n         then created\
  \ from a combination of information in \e[4mFILE\e[0m (as if the\n         \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e\
  [0m option was used), and tag values assigned on the\n         command line. If\
  \ no \e[4mFILE\e[0m is specified, the output file may be created\n         from\
  \ scratch using only tags assigned on the command line.\n\n    \e[1m-overwrite_original\e\
  [0m\n         Overwrite the original \e[4mFILE\e[0m (instead of preserving it by\
  \ adding\n         \"_original\" to the file name) when writing information to an\
  \ image.\n         Caution: This option should only be used if you already have\
  \ separate\n         backup copies of your image files. The overwrite is implemented\
  \ by\n         renaming a temporary file to replace the original. This deletes the\n\
  \         original file and replaces it with the edited version in a single\n  \
  \       operation. When combined with \e[1m-o\e[0m, this option causes the original\n\
  \         file to be deleted if the output file was successfully written (ie.\n\
  \         the file is moved instead of copied).\n\n    \e[1m-overwrite_original_in_place\e\
  [0m\n         Similar to \e[1m-overwrite_original\e[0m except that an extra step\
  \ is added to\n         allow the original file attributes to be preserved. For\
  \ example, on a\n         Mac this causes the original file creation date, type,\
  \ creator, label\n         color, icon, Finder tags, other extended attributes and\
  \ hard links to\n         the file to be preserved (but note that the Mac OS resource\
  \ fork is\n         always preserved unless specifically deleted with \"-rsrc:all=\"\
  ). This\n         is implemented by opening the original file in update mode and\n\
  \         replacing its data with a copy of a temporary file before deleting\n \
  \        the temporary. The extra step results in slower performance, so the\n \
  \        \e[1m-overwrite_original\e[0m option should be used instead unless necessary.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-P\e[0m (\e[1m-preserve\e[0m)\n         Preserve the filesystem modification\
  \ date/time (\"FileModifyDate\") of\n         the original file when writing. Note\
  \ that some filesystems store a\n         creation date (Windows \"FileCreateDate\"\
  \ or Mac\n         \"MDItemFSCreationDate\") which is not affected by this option.\
  \ The\n         creation date is preserved on Windows systems where Win32API::File\n\
  \         and Win32::API are available regardless of this setting. For other\n \
  \        systems, the \e[1m-overwrite_original_in_place\e[0m option may be used\
  \ if\n         necessary to preserve the creation date. This option is superseded\
  \ by\n         any value written to the FileModifyDate tag.\n\n    \e[1m-password\e\
  [0m \e[4mPASSWD\e[0m\n         Specify password to allow processing of password-protected\
  \ PDF\n         documents. If a password is required but not given, a warning is\n\
  \         issued and the document is not processed. This option is ignored if a\n\
  \         password is not required.\n\n    \e[1m-progress\e[0m[:[\e[4mTITLE\e[0m]]\n\
  \         Show the progress when processing files. Without a colon, the\n      \
  \   \e[1m-progress\e[0m option adds a progress count in brackets after the name\
  \ of\n         each processed file, giving the current file number and the total\n\
  \         number of files to be processed. Implies the \e[1m-v0\e[0m option, causing\
  \ the\n         names of processed files to also be printed when writing. When\n\
  \         combined with the \e[1m-if\e[0m option, the total count includes all files\n\
  \         before the condition is applied, but files that fail the condition\n \
  \        will not have their names printed.\n\n         If followed by a colon (ie.\
  \ \e[1m-progress:\e[0m), the console window title is\n         set according to\
  \ the specified \e[4mTITLE\e[0m string. If no \e[4mTITLE\e[0m is given, a\n    \
  \     default \e[4mTITLE\e[0m string of \"ExifTool %p%%\" is assumed. In the string,\
  \ %f\n         represents the file name, %p is the progress as a percent, %r is\
  \ the\n         progress as a ratio, %##b is a progress bar of width \"##\" (20\n\
  \         characters if \"##\" is omitted), and %% is a % character. May be\n  \
  \       combined with the normal \e[1m-progress\e[0m option to also show the progress\n\
  \         count in console messages. (Note: For this feature to function\n     \
  \    correctly on Mac/Linux, stderr must go to the console.)\n\n    \e[1m-q\e[0m\
  \ (\e[1m-quiet\e[0m)\n         Quiet processing. One \e[1m-q\e[0m suppresses normal\
  \ informational messages,\n         and a second \e[1m-q\e[0m suppresses warnings\
  \ as well. Error messages can not\n         be suppressed, although minor errors\
  \ may be downgraded to warnings\n         with the \e[1m-m\e[0m option, which may\
  \ then be suppressed with \"-q -q\".\n\n    \e[1m-r\e[0m[.] (\e[1m-recurse\e[0m)\n\
  \         Recursively process files in subdirectories. Only meaningful if\n    \
  \     \e[4mFILE\e[0m is a directory name. Subdirectories with names beginning with\n\
  \         \".\" are not processed unless \".\" is added to the option name (ie.\n\
  \         \e[1m-r.\e[0m or \e[1m-recurse.\e[0m). By default, exiftool will also\
  \ follow symbolic\n         links to directories if supported by the system, but\
  \ this may be\n         disabled with \"-i SYMLINKS\" (see the \e[1m-i\e[0m option\
  \ for details). Combine\n         this with \e[1m-ext\e[0m options to control the\
  \ types of files processed.\n\n    \e[1m-scanForXMP\e[0m\n         Scan all files\
  \ (even unsupported formats) for XMP information unless\n         found already.\
  \ When combined with the \e[1m-fast\e[0m option, only unsupported\n         file\
  \ types are scanned. Warning: It can be time consuming to scan\n         large files.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-u\e[0m (\e[1m-unknown\e[0m)\n         Extract values of unknown tags.\
  \ Add another \e[1m-u\e[0m to also extract\n         unknown information from binary\
  \ data blocks. This option applies to\n         tags with numerical tag ID's, and\
  \ causes tag names like \"Exif_0xc5d9\"\n         to be generated for unknown information.\
  \ It has no effect on\n         information types which have human-readable tag\
  \ ID's (such as XMP),\n         since unknown tags are extracted automatically from\
  \ these formats.\n\n    \e[1m-U\e[0m (\e[1m-unknown2\e[0m)\n         Extract values\
  \ of unknown tags as well as unknown information from\n         some binary data\
  \ blocks. This is the same as two \e[1m-u\e[0m options.\n\n    \e[1m-wm\e[0m \e\
  [4mMODE\e[0m (\e[1m-writeMode\e[0m)\n         Set mode for writing/creating tags.\
  \ \e[4mMODE\e[0m is a string of one or more\n         characters from the list below.\
  \ The default write mode is \"wcg\".\n\n             w - Write existing tags\n \
  \            c - Create new tags\n             g - create new Groups as necessary\n\
  \n         For example, use \"-wm cg\" to only create new tags (and avoid editing\n\
  \         existing ones).\n\n         The level of the group is the SubDirectory\
  \ level in the metadata\n         structure. For XMP or IPTC this is the full XMP/IPTC\
  \ block (the\n         family 0 group), but for EXIF this is the individual IFD\
  \ (the family\n         1 group).\n\n    \e[1m-z\e[0m (\e[1m-zip\e[0m)\n       \
  \  When reading, causes information to be extracted from .gz and .bz2\n        \
  \ compressed images (only one image per archive; requires gzip and\n         bzip2\
  \ to be available). When writing, causes compressed information\n         to be\
  \ written if supported by the metadata format (eg. compressed\n         textual\
  \ metadata in PNG), disables the recommended padding in\n         embedded XMP (saving\
  \ 2424 bytes when writing XMP in a file), and\n         writes XMP in shorthand\
  \ format -- the equivalent of setting the API\n         Compress, Compact and XMPShorthand\
  \ options to 1.\n\n   Other options\n    \e[1m-@\e[0m \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m\n      \
  \   Read command-line arguments from the specified file. The file\n         contains\
  \ one argument per line (NOT one option per line -- some\n         options require\
  \ additional arguments, and all arguments must be\n         placed on separate lines).\
  \ Blank lines and lines beginning with \"#\"\n         are ignored (unless they\
  \ start with \"#[CSTR]\", in which case the rest\n         of the line is treated\
  \ as a C string, allowing standard C escape\n         sequences such as \"\\n\"\
  \ for a newline). White space at the start of a\n         line is removed. Normal\
  \ shell processing of arguments is not\n         performed, which among other things\
  \ means that arguments should not\n         be quoted and spaces are treated as\
  \ any other character. \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m may\n         exist relative to either\
  \ the current directory or the exiftool\n         directory unless an absolute pathname\
  \ is given.\n\n         For example, the following \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m will set the\
  \ value of Copyright to\n         \"Copyright YYYY, Phil Harvey\", where \"YYYY\"\
  \ is the year of\n         CreateDate:\n\n             -d\n             %Y\n   \
  \          -copyright<Copyright $createdate, Phil Harvey\n\n         Arguments in\
  \ \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m behave exactly the same as if they were entered\n         at\
  \ the location of the \e[1m-@\e[0m option on the command line, with the\n      \
  \   exception that the \e[1m-config\e[0m and \e[1m-common_args\e[0m options may\
  \ not be used\n         in an \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-k\e[0m (\e[1m-pause\e\
  [0m)\n         Pause with the message \"-- press any key --\" or \"-- press RETURN\
  \ --\"\n         (depending on your system) before terminating. This option is used\
  \ to\n         prevent the command window from closing when run as a Windows drag\n\
  \         and drop application.\n\n    \e[1m-list\e[0m, \e[1m-listw\e[0m, \e[1m-listf\e\
  [0m, \e[1m-listr\e[0m, \e[1m-listwf\e[0m, \e[1m-listg\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m], \e[1m-listd\e\
  [0m,\n    \e[1m-listx\e[0m\n         Print a list of all valid tag names (\e[1m-list\e\
  [0m), all writable tag names\n         (\e[1m-listw\e[0m), all supported file extensions\
  \ (\e[1m-listf\e[0m), all recognized file\n         extensions (\e[1m-listr\e[0m),\
  \ all writable file extensions (\e[1m-listwf\e[0m), all tag\n         groups [in\
  \ a specified family] (\e[1m-listg\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e[0m]), all deletable tag\n   \
  \      groups (\e[1m-listd\e[0m), or an XML database of tag details including language\n\
  \         translations (\e[1m-listx\e[0m). The \e[1m-list\e[0m, \e[1m-listw\e[0m\
  \ and \e[1m-listx\e[0m options may be\n         followed by an additional argument\
  \ of the form \"-GROUP:All\" to list\n         only tags in a specific group, where\
  \ \"GROUP\" is one or more family\n         0-2 group names (excepting EXIF IFD\
  \ groups) separated by colons. With\n         \e[1m-listg\e[0m, \e[4mNUM\e[0m may\
  \ be given to specify the group family, otherwise\n         family 0 is assumed.\
  \ The \e[1m-l\e[0m option may be combined with \e[1m-listf\e[0m,\n         \e[1m-listr\e\
  [0m or \e[1m-listwf\e[0m to add file descriptions to the list. The \e[1m-lang\e\
  [0m\n         option may be combined with \e[1m-listx\e[0m to output descriptions\
  \ in a single\n         language. Here are some examples:\n\n             -list\
  \               # list all tag names\n             -list -EXIF:All     # list all\
  \ EXIF tags\n             -list -xmp:time:all # list all XMP tags relating to time\n\
  \             -listw -XMP-dc:All  # list all writable XMP-dc tags\n            \
  \ -listf              # list all supported file extensions\n             -listr\
  \              # list all recognized file extensions\n             -listwf     \
  \        # list all writable file extensions\n             -listg1             #\
  \ list all groups in family 1\n             -listd              # list all deletable\
  \ groups\n             -listx -EXIF:All    # list database of EXIF tags in XML format\n\
  \             -listx -XMP:All -s  # list short XML database of XMP tags\n\n    \
  \     When combined with \e[1m-listx\e[0m, the \e[1m-s\e[0m option shortens the\
  \ output by\n         omitting the descriptions and values (as in the last example\
  \ above),\n         and \e[1m-f\e[0m adds a 'flags' attribute if applicable. The\
  \ flags are\n         formatted as a comma-separated list of the following possible\
  \ values:\n         Avoid, Binary, List, Mandatory, Permanent, Protected, Unknown\
  \ and\n         Unsafe (see the Tag Name documentation). For XMP List tags, the\
  \ list\n         type (Alt, Bag or Seq) is added to the flags, and flattened structure\n\
  \         tags are indicated by a Flattened flag.\n\n         Note that none of\
  \ the \e[1m-list\e[0m options require an input \e[4mFILE\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1m-ver\e\
  [0m Print exiftool version number. The \e[1m-v\e[0m option may be added to print\n\
  \         addition system information (see the README file of the full\n       \
  \  distribution for more details about optional libraries), or \e[1m-v2\e[0m to\n\
  \         also list the Perl include directories.\n\n   Special features\n    \e\
  [1m-geotag\e[0m \e[4mTRKFILE\e[0m\n         Geotag images from the specified GPS\
  \ track log file. Using the\n         \e[1m-geotag\e[0m option is equivalent to\
  \ writing a value to the \"Geotag\" tag.\n         After the \e[1m-geotag\e[0m option\
  \ has been specified, the value of the\n         \"Geotime\" tag is written to define\
  \ a date/time for the position\n         interpolation. If \"Geotime\" is not specified,\
  \ the value is copied\n         from \"DateTimeOriginal#\" (the \"#\" is added to\
  \ copy the unformatted\n         value, avoiding potential conflicts with the \e\
  [1m-d\e[0m option). For example,\n         the following two commands are equivalent:\n\
  \n             exiftool -geotag trk.log image.jpg\n             exiftool -geotag\
  \ trk.log \"-Geotime<DateTimeOriginal#\" image.jpg\n\n         When the \"Geotime\"\
  \ value is converted to UTC, the local system\n         timezone is assumed unless\
  \ the date/time value contains a timezone.\n         Writing \"Geotime\" causes\
  \ the following tags to be written (provided\n         they can be calculated from\
  \ the track log, and they are supported by\n         the destination metadata format):\
  \ GPSLatitude, GPSLatitudeRef,\n         GPSLongitude, GPSLongitudeRef, GPSAltitude,\
  \ GPSAltitudeRef,\n         GPSDateStamp, GPSTimeStamp, GPSDateTime, GPSTrack, GPSTrackRef,\n\
  \         GPSSpeed, GPSSpeedRef, GPSImgDirection, GPSImgDirectionRef, GPSPitch\n\
  \         and GPSRoll. By default, tags are created in EXIF, and updated in XMP\n\
  \         only if they already exist. However, \"EXIF:Geotime\" or \"XMP:Geotime\"\
  \n         may be specified to write only EXIF or XMP tags respectively. Note\n\
  \         that GPSPitch and GPSRoll are non-standard, and require user-defined\n\
  \         tags in order to be written.\n\n         The \"Geosync\" tag may be used\
  \ to specify a time correction which is\n         applied to each \"Geotime\" value\
  \ for synchronization with GPS time.\n         For example, the following command\
  \ compensates for image times which\n         are 1 minute and 20 seconds behind\
  \ GPS:\n\n             exiftool -geosync=+1:20 -geotag a.log DIR\n\n         \"\
  Geosync\" must be set before \"Geotime\" (if specified) to be\n         effective.\
  \ Advanced \"Geosync\" features allow a linear time drift\n         correction and\
  \ synchronization from previously geotagged images. See\n         \"geotag.html\"\
  \ in the full ExifTool distribution for more information.\n\n         Multiple \e\
  [1m-geotag\e[0m options may be used to concatenate GPS track log\n         data.\
  \ Also, a single \e[1m-geotag\e[0m option may be used to load multiple\n       \
  \  track log files by using wildcards in the \e[4mTRKFILE\e[0m name, but note that\n\
  \         in this case \e[4mTRKFILE\e[0m must be quoted on most systems (with the\
  \ notable\n         exception of Windows) to prevent filename expansion. For example:\n\
  \n             exiftool -geotag \"TRACKDIR/*.log\" IMAGEDIR\n\n         Currently\
  \ supported track file formats are GPX, NMEA RMC/GGA/GLL,\n         KML, IGC, Garmin\
  \ XML and TCX, Magellan PMGNTRK, Honeywell PTNTHPR,\n         Winplus Beacon text,\
  \ and Bramor gEO log files. See \"GEOTAGGING\n         EXAMPLES\" for examples.\
  \ Also see \"geotag.html\" in the full ExifTool\n         distribution and the Image::ExifTool\
  \ Options for more details and for\n         information about geotag configuration\
  \ options.\n\n    \e[1m-globalTimeShift\e[0m \e[4mSHIFT\e[0m\n         Shift all\
  \ formatted date/time values by the specified amount when\n         reading. Does\
  \ not apply to unformatted (\e[1m-n\e[0m) output. \e[4mSHIFT\e[0m takes the\n  \
  \       same form as the date/time shift when writing (see\n         Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl\
  \ for details), with a negative shift being\n         indicated with a minus sign\
  \ (\"-\") at the start of the \e[4mSHIFT\e[0m string.\n         For example:\n\n\
  \             # return all date/times, shifted back by 1 hour\n             exiftool\
  \ -globalTimeShift -1 -time:all a.jpg\n\n             # set the file name from the\
  \ shifted CreateDate (-1 day) for\n             # all images in a directory\n  \
  \           exiftool \"-filename<createdate\" -globaltimeshift \"-0:0:1 0:0:0\"\
  \ \\\n                 -d %Y%m%d-%H%M%S.%%e dir\n\n    \e[1m-use\e[0m \e[4mMODULE\e\
  [0m\n         Add features from specified plug-in \e[4mMODULE\e[0m. Currently, the\
  \ MWG module\n         is the only plug-in module distributed with exiftool. This\
  \ module\n         adds read/write support for tags as recommended by the Metadata\n\
  \         Working Group. To save typing, \"-use MWG\" is assumed if the \"MWG\"\n\
  \         group is specified for any tag on the command line. See the MWG Tags\n\
  \         documentation for more details. Note that this option is not\n       \
  \  reversible, and remains in effect until the application terminates,\n       \
  \  even across the \"-execute\" option.\n\n   Utilities\n    \e[1m-restore_original\e\
  [0m\n    \e[1m-delete_original\e[0m[!]\n         These utility options automate\
  \ the maintenance of the \"_original\"\n         files created by exiftool. They\
  \ have no effect on files without an\n         \"_original\" copy. The \e[1m-restore_original\e\
  [0m option restores the specified\n         files from their original copies by\
  \ renaming the \"_original\" files to\n         replace the edited versions. For\
  \ example, the following command\n         restores the originals of all JPG images\
  \ in directory \"DIR\":\n\n             exiftool -restore_original -ext jpg DIR\n\
  \n         The \e[1m-delete_original\e[0m option deletes the \"_original\" copies\
  \ of all\n         files specified on the command line. Without a trailing \"!\"\
  \ this\n         option prompts for confirmation before continuing. For example,\
  \ the\n         following command deletes \"a.jpg_original\" if it exists, after\
  \ asking\n         \"Are you sure?\":\n\n             exiftool -delete_original\
  \ a.jpg\n\n         These options may not be used with other options to read or\
  \ write tag\n         values in the same command, but may be combined with options\
  \ such\n         \e[1m-ext\e[0m, \e[1m-if\e[0m, \e[1m-r\e[0m, \e[1m-q\e[0m and \e\
  [1m-v\e[0m.\n\n   Advanced options\n    Among other things, the advanced options\
  \ allow complex processing to be\n    performed from a single command without the\
  \ need for additional scripting.\n    This may be particularly useful for implementations\
  \ such as Windows\n    drag-and-drop applications. These options may also be used\
  \ to improve\n    performance in multi-pass processing by reducing the overhead\
  \ required to\n    load exiftool for each invocation.\n\n    \e[1m-api\e[0m \e[4mOPT[[^]=[VAL]]\e\
  [0m\n         Set ExifTool API option. \e[4mOPT\e[0m is an API option name. The\
  \ option value\n         is set to 1 if \e[4m=VAL\e[0m is omitted. If \e[4mVAL\e\
  [0m is omitted, the option value\n         is set to undef if \"=\" is used, or\
  \ an empty string with \"^=\". See\n         Image::ExifTool Options for a list\
  \ of available API options. This\n         overrides API options set via the config\
  \ file.\n\n    \e[1m-common_args\e[0m\n         Specifies that all arguments following\
  \ this option are common to all\n         executed commands when \e[1m-execute\e\
  [0m is used. This and the \e[1m-config\e[0m option\n         are the only options\
  \ that may not be used inside a \e[1m-@\e[0m \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m. Note\n         that\
  \ by definition this option and its arguments MUST come after all\n         other\
  \ options on the command line.\n\n    \e[1m-config\e[0m \e[4mCFGFILE\e[0m\n    \
  \     Load specified configuration file instead of the default\n         \".ExifTool_config\"\
  . If used, this option must come before all other\n         arguments on the command\
  \ line and applies to all \e[1m-execute\e[0m'd commands.\n         The \e[4mCFGFILE\e\
  [0m must exist relative to the current working directory or\n         the exiftool\
  \ application directory unless an absolute path is\n         specified. Loading\
  \ of the default config file may be disabled by\n         setting \e[4mCFGFILE\e\
  [0m to an empty string (ie. \"\"). See\n         <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/config.html>\
  \ and\n         config_files/example.config in the full ExifTool distribution for\n\
  \         details about the configuration file syntax.\n\n    \e[1m-echo\e[0m[\e\
  [4mNUM\e[0m] \e[4mTEXT\e[0m\n         Echo \e[4mTEXT\e[0m to stdout (\e[1m-echo\e\
  [0m or \e[1m-echo1\e[0m) or stderr (\e[1m-echo2\e[0m). Text is\n         output\
  \ as the command line is parsed, before the processing of any\n         input files.\
  \ \e[4mNUM\e[0m may also be 3 or 4 to output text (to stdout or\n         stderr\
  \ respectively) after processing is complete.\n\n    \e[1m-execute\e[0m[\e[4mNUM\e\
  [0m]\n         Execute command for all arguments up to this point on the command\n\
  \         line (plus any arguments specified by \e[1m-common_args\e[0m). The result\
  \ is as\n         if the commands were executed as separate command lines (with\
  \ the\n         exception of the \e[1m-config\e[0m and \e[1m-use\e[0m options which\
  \ remain in effect for\n         subsequent commands). Allows multiple commands\
  \ to be executed from a\n         single command line. \e[4mNUM\e[0m is an optional\
  \ number that is echoed in the\n         \"{ready}\" message when using the \e[1m-stay_open\e\
  [0m feature.\n\n    \e[1m-srcfile\e[0m \e[4mFMT\e[0m\n         Specify a different\
  \ source file to be processed based on the name of\n         the original \e[4mFILE\e\
  [0m. This may be useful in some special situations for\n         processing related\
  \ preview images or sidecar files. See the \e[1m-w\e[0m option\n         for a description\
  \ of the \e[4mFMT\e[0m syntax. Note that file name \e[4mFMT\e[0m strings\n     \
  \    for all options are based on the original \e[4mFILE\e[0m specified from the\n\
  \         command line, not the name of the source file specified by \e[1m-srcfile\e\
  [0m.\n\n         For example, to copy metadata from NEF files to the corresponding\
  \ JPG\n         previews in a directory where other JPG images may exist:\n\n  \
  \           exiftool -ext nef -tagsfromfile @ -srcfile %d%f.jpg dir\n\n        \
  \ If than one \e[1m-srcfile\e[0m option is specified, the files are tested in\n\
  \         order and the first existing source file is processed. If none of the\n\
  \         source files already exist, then exiftool uses the first \e[1m-srcfile\e\
  [0m\n         specified.\n\n         A \e[4mFMT\e[0m of \"@\" may be used to represent\
  \ the original \e[4mFILE\e[0m, which may be\n         useful when specifying multiple\
  \ \e[1m-srcfile\e[0m options (eg. to fall back to\n         processing the original\
  \ \e[4mFILE\e[0m if no sidecar exists).\n\n    \e[1m-stay_open\e[0m \e[4mFLAG\e\
  [0m\n         If \e[4mFLAG\e[0m is 1 or \"True\", causes exiftool keep reading from\
  \ the \e[1m-@\e[0m\n         \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m even after reaching the end of file.\
  \ This feature allows\n         calling applications to pre-load exiftool, thus\
  \ avoiding the overhead\n         of loading exiftool for each command. The procedure\
  \ is as follows:\n\n         1) Execute \"exiftool -stay_open True -@ \e[4mARGFILE\e\
  [0m\", where \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m is\n         the name of an existing (possibly empty)\
  \ argument file or \"-\" to pipe\n         arguments from the standard input.\n\n\
  \         2) Write exiftool command-line arguments to \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m, one argument\
  \ per\n         line (see the \e[1m-@\e[0m option for details).\n\n         3) Write\
  \ \"-execute\\n\" to \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m, where \"\\n\" represents a newline\n   \
  \      sequence. (Note: You may need to flush your write buffers here if\n     \
  \    using buffered output.) Exiftool will then execute the command with\n     \
  \    the arguments received up to this point, send a \"{ready}\" message to\n  \
  \       stdout when done (unless the \e[1m-q\e[0m or \e[1m-T\e[0m option is used),\
  \ and continue\n         trying to read arguments for the next command from \e[4mARGFILE\e\
  [0m. To aid in\n         command/response synchronization, any number appended to\
  \ the\n         \"-execute\" option is echoed in the \"{ready}\" message. For example,\n\
  \         \"-execute613\" results in \"{ready613}\".\n\n         4) Repeat steps\
  \ 2 and 3 for each command.\n\n         5) Write \"-stay_open\\nFalse\\n\" to \e\
  [4mARGFILE\e[0m when done. This will cause\n         exiftool to process any remaining\
  \ command-line arguments then exit\n         normally.\n\n         The input \e\
  [4mARGFILE\e[0m may be changed at any time before step 5 above by\n         writing\
  \ the following lines to the currently open \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m:\n\n             -stay_open\n\
  \             True\n             -@\n             NEWARGFILE\n\n         This causes\
  \ \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m to be closed, and \e[4mNEWARGFILE\e[0m to be kept open.\n  \
  \       (Without the \e[1m-stay_open\e[0m here, exiftool would have returned to\
  \ reading\n         arguments from \e[4mARGFILE\e[0m after reaching the end of \e\
  [4mNEWARGFILE\e[0m.)\n\n         Note: When writing arguments to a disk file there\
  \ is a delay of up to\n         0.01 seconds after writing \"-execute\\n\" before\
  \ exiftool starts\n         processing the command. This delay may be avoided by\
  \ sending a CONT\n         signal to the exiftool process immediately after writing\n\
  \         \"-execute\\n\". (There is no associated delay when writing arguments\n\
  \         via a pipe with \"-@ -\", so the signal is not necessary when using\n\
  \         this technique.)\n\n    \e[1m-userParam\e[0m \e[4mPARAM[[^]=[VAL]]\e[0m\n\
  \         Set user parameter. \e[4mPARAM\e[0m is an arbitrary user parameter name.\
  \ This\n         is an interface to the API UserParam option (see the Image::ExifTool\n\
  \         Options documentation), and provides a method to access user-defined\n\
  \         parameters from inside tag name expressions (as if it were any other\n\
  \         tag, see example below), and from PrintConv/ValueConv logic (via the\n\
  \         ExifTool Options function). Similar to the \e[1m-api\e[0m option, the\
  \ parameter\n         value is set to 1 if \e[4m=VAL\e[0m is omitted, undef if just\
  \ \e[4mVAL\e[0m is omitted\n         with \"=\", or an empty string if \e[4mVAL\e\
  [0m is omitted with \"^=\".\n\n             exiftool -p '$test from $filename' -userparam\
  \ test=Hello FILE\n\n   Advanced formatting feature\n    An advanced formatting\
  \ feature allows modification of the value of any tag\n    interpolated within a\
  \ \e[1m-if\e[0m or \e[1m-p\e[0m option argument, or a \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m\n\
  \    redirection string. Tag names within these strings are prefixed by a \"$\"\n\
  \    symbol, and an arbitrary Perl expression may be applied to the tag value\n\
  \    by placing braces around the tag name and inserting the expression after\n\
  \    the name, separated by a semicolon (ie. \"${TAG;EXPR}\"). The expression\n\
  \    acts on the value of the tag through the default input variable ($_), and\n\
  \    has access to the full ExifTool API through the current ExifTool object\n \
  \   ($self) and the tag key ($tag). It may contain any valid Perl code,\n    including\
  \ translation (\"tr///\") and substitution (\"s///\") operations, but\n    note\
  \ that braces within the expression must be balanced. The example below\n    prints\
  \ the camera Make with spaces translated to underlines, and multiple\n    consecutive\
  \ underlines replaced by a single underline:\n\n        exiftool -p '${make;tr/\
  \ /_/;s/__+/_/g}' image.jpg\n\n    An \"@\" may be added after the tag name to make\
  \ the expression act on\n    individual list items for list-type tags, simplifying\
  \ list processing. Set\n    $_ to undef to remove an item from the list. As an example,\
  \ the following\n    command returns all subjects not containing the string \"xxx\"\
  :\n\n        exiftool -p '${subject@;$_=undef if /xxx/}' image.jpg\n\n    A default\
  \ expression of \"tr(/\\\\?*:|\"<>\\0)()d\" is assumed if the expression\n    is\
  \ empty (ie. \"${TAG;}\"). This removes the characters / \\ ? * : | < > and\n  \
  \  null from the printed value. (These characters are illegal in Windows file\n\
  \    names, so this feature is useful if tag values are used in file names.)\n\n\
  \   Helper functions\n    \"DateFmt\"\n\n    Simplifies reformatting of individual\
  \ date/time values. This function acts\n    on a standard EXIF-formatted date/time\
  \ value in $_ and formats it\n    according to the specified format string (see\
  \ the \e[1m-d\e[0m option). To avoid\n    trying to reformat an already-formatted\
  \ date/time value, a \"#\" must be\n    added to the tag name (as in the example\
  \ below) if the \e[1m-d\e[0m option is also\n    used. For example:\n\n        exiftool\
  \ -p '${createdate#;DateFmt(\"%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S\")}' a.jpg\n\n    \"ShiftTime\"\n\n\
  \    Shifts EXIF-formatted date/time string by a specified amount. Start with a\n\
  \    leading minus sign to shift backwards in time. See\n    Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl\
  \ for details about shift syntax. For example, to\n    shift a date/time value back\
  \ by one year:\n\n        exiftool -p '${createdate;ShiftTime(\"-1:0:0 0\")}' a.jpg\n\
  \n    \"NoDups\"\n\n    Removes duplicate items from a list with a separator specified\
  \ by the\n    \e[1m-sep\e[0m option. This function is most useful when copying list-type\
  \ tags. For\n    example, the following command may be used to remove duplicate\
  \ Keywords:\n\n        exiftool -sep '##' '-keywords<${keywords;NoDups}' a.jpg\n\
  \n    The \e[1m-sep\e[0m option is necessary to split the string back into individual\
  \ list\n    items when writing to a list-type tag.\n\n    An optional flag argument\
  \ may be set to 1 to cause \"NoDups\" to return\n    undef if no duplicates existed,\
  \ thus preventing the file from being\n    rewritten unnecessarily:\n\n        exiftool\
  \ -sep '##' '-keywords<${keywords;NoDups(1)}' a.jpg\n\n    Note that function names\
  \ are case sensitive.\n\n\e[1mWINDOWS UNICODE FILE NAMES\e[0m\n    In Windows, command-line\
  \ arguments are specified using the current code\n    page and are recoded automatically\
  \ to the system code page. This recoding\n    is not done for arguments in ExifTool\
  \ arg files, so by default filenames\n    in arg files use the system code page.\
  \ Unfortunately, these code pages are\n    not complete character sets, so not all\
  \ file names may be represented.\n\n    ExifTool 9.79 and later allow the file name\
  \ encoding to be specified with\n    \"-charset filename=CHARSET\", where \"CHARSET\"\
  \ is the name of a valid\n    ExifTool character set, preferably \"UTF8\" (see the\
  \ \e[1m-charset\e[0m option for a\n    complete list). Setting this triggers the\
  \ use of Windows wide-character\n    i/o routines, thus providing support for most\
  \ Unicode file names (see note\n    4). But note that it is not trivial to pass\
  \ properly encoded file names on\n    the Windows command line (see\n    <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/faq.html#Q18>\
  \ for details), so\n    placing them in a UTF-8 encoded \e[1m-@\e[0m argfile and\
  \ using \"-charset\n    filename=utf8\" is recommended if possible.\n\n    A warning\
  \ is issued if a specified filename contains special characters\n    and the filename\
  \ character set was not provided. However, the warning may\n    be disabled by setting\
  \ \"-charset filename=\"\"\", and ExifTool may still\n    function correctly if\
  \ the system code page matches the character set used\n    for the file names.\n\
  \n    When a directory name is provided, the file name encoding need not be\n  \
  \  specified (unless the directory name contains special characters), and\n    ExifTool\
  \ will automatically use wide-character routines to scan the\n    directory.\n\n\
  \    The filename character set applies to the \e[4mFILE\e[0m arguments as well\
  \ as\n    filename arguments of \e[1m-@\e[0m, \e[1m-geotag\e[0m, \e[1m-o\e[0m, \e\
  [1m-p\e[0m, \e[1m-srcfile\e[0m, \e[1m-tagsFromFile\e[0m, \e[1m-csv\e[0m=,\n    \e\
  [1m-j\e[0m= and \e[1m-\e[0m\e[4mTAG\e[0m<=. However, it does not apply to the \e\
  [1m-config\e[0m filename, which\n    always uses the system character set. The \"\
  -charset filename=\" option must\n    come before the \e[1m-@\e[0m option to be\
  \ effective, but the order doesn't matter\n    with respect to other options.\n\n\
  \    Notes:\n\n    1) FileName and Directory tag values still use the same encoding\
  \ as other\n    tag values, and are converted to/from the filename character set\
  \ when\n    writing/reading if specified.\n\n    2) Unicode support is not yet implemented\
  \ for other Windows-based systems\n    like Cygwin.\n\n    3) See \"WRITING READ-ONLY\
  \ FILES\" below for a note about editing read-only\n    files with Unicode names.\n\
  \n    4) Unicode file names with surrogate pairs (code points over U+FFFF) still\n\
  \    cause problems.\n\n\e[1mWRITING READ-ONLY FILES\e[0m\n    In general, ExifTool\
  \ may be used to write metadata to read-only files\n    provided that the user has\
  \ write permission in the directory. However,\n    there are three cases where file\
  \ write permission is also required:\n\n    1) When using the \e[1m-overwrite_original_in_place\e\
  [0m option.\n\n    2) When writing only pseudo System tags (eg. FileModifyDate).\n\
  \n    3) On Windows if the file has Unicode characters in its name, and a) the\n\
  \    \e[1m-overwrite_original\e[0m option is used, or b) the \"_original\" backup\
  \ already\n    exists.\n\n\e[1mREADING EXAMPLES\e[0m\n    \e[1mNote\e[0m: Beware\
  \ when cutting and pasting these examples into your terminal!\n    Some characters\
  \ such as single and double quotes and hyphens may have been\n    changed into similar-looking\
  \ yet functionally-different characters by the\n    text formatter used to display\
  \ this documentation. Also note that Windows\n    users must use double quotes instead\
  \ of single quotes as below around\n    arguments containing special characters.\n\

  \e[1mWRITING EXAMPLES\e[0m\n    Note that quotes are necessary around arguments\
  \ which contain certain\n    special characters such as \">\", \"<\" or any white\
  \ space. These quoting\n    techniques are shell dependent, but the examples below\
  \ will work for most\n    Unix shells. With the Windows cmd shell however, double\
  \ quotes should be\n    used (eg. -Comment=\"This is a new comment\").\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -Comment='This is a new comment' dst.jpg\n         Write new comment to a JPG\
  \ image (replaces any existing comment).\n\n    exiftool -comment= -o newdir -ext\
  \ jpg .\n         Remove comment from all JPG images in the current directory, writing\n\
  \         the modified images to a new directory.\n\n    exiftool -keywords=EXIF\
  \ -keywords=editor dst.jpg\n         Replace existing keyword list with two new\
  \ keywords (\"EXIF\" and\n         \"editor\").\n\n    exiftool -Keywords+=word\
  \ -o newfile.jpg src.jpg\n         Copy a source image to a new file, and add a\
  \ keyword (\"word\") to the\n         current list of keywords.\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -exposurecompensation+=-0.5 a.jpg\n         Decrement the value of ExposureCompensation\
  \ by 0.5 EV. Note that +=\n         with a negative value is used for decrementing\
  \ because the -=\n         operator is used for conditional deletion (see next example).\n\
  \n    exiftool -credit-=xxx dir\n         Delete Credit information from all files\
  \ in a directory where the\n         Credit value was \"xxx\".\n\n    exiftool -xmp:description-de='k&uuml;hl'\

  \ character\n         escaping to input special characters.\n\n    exiftool -all=\
  \ dst.jpg\n         Delete all meta information from an image. Note: You should\
  \ NOT do\n         this to RAW images (except DNG) since proprietary RAW image formats\n\

  \ -ext NEF -r .\n         Recursively write JPEG images with filenames ending in\
  \ \"_JFR.JPG\" to\n         the JpgFromRaw tag of like-named files with extension\
  \ \".NEF\" in the\n         current directory. (This is the inverse of the \"-JpgFromRaw\"\
  \ command\n         of the \"READING EXAMPLES\" section above.)\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -DateTimeOriginal-='0:0:0 1:30:0' dir\n         Adjust original date/time of all\
  \ images in directory \"dir\" by\n         subtracting one hour and 30 minutes.\
  \ (This is equivalent to\n         \"-DateTimeOriginal-=1.5\". See Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl\
  \ for details.)\n\n    exiftool -createdate+=3 -modifydate+=3 a.jpg b.jpg\n    \
  \     Add 3 hours to the CreateDate and ModifyDate timestamps of two\n         images.\n\
  \n    exiftool -AllDates+=1:30 -if '$make eq \"Canon\"' dir\n         Shift the\
  \ values of DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate and ModifyDate\n         forward by 1 hour\
  \ and 30 minutes for all Canon images in a directory.\n         (The AllDates tag\
  \ is provided as a shortcut for these three tags,\n         allowing them to be\
  \ accessed via a single tag.)\n\n    exiftool -xmp:city=Kingston image1.jpg image2.nef\n\
  \         Write a tag to the XMP group of two images. (Without the \"xmp:\" this\n\
  \         tag would get written to the IPTC group since \"City\" exists in both,\n\
  \         and IPTC is preferred by default.)\n\n    exiftool -LightSource-='Unknown\

  \ Delete any trailer found after the end of image (EOI) in a JPEG file.\n      \
  \   A number of digital cameras store a large PreviewImage after the JPEG\n    \
  \     EOI, and the file size may be reduced significantly by deleting this\n   \
  \      trailer. See the JPEG Tags documentation for a list of recognized\n     \
  \    JPEG trailers.\n\n\e[1mCOPYING EXAMPLES\e[0m\n    These examples demonstrate\
  \ the ability to copy tag values between files.\n\n    exiftool -tagsFromFile src.cr2\
  \ dst.jpg\n         Copy the values of all writable tags from \"src.cr2\" to \"\
  dst.jpg\",\n         writing the information to same-named tags in the preferred\
  \ groups.\n\n    exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -all:all dst.jpg\n         Copy\
  \ the values of all writable tags from \"src.jpg\" to \"dst.jpg\",\n         preserving\
  \ the original tag groups.\n\n    exiftool -all= -tagsfromfile src.jpg -exif:all\
  \ dst.jpg\n         Erase all meta information from \"dst.jpg\" image, then copy\
  \ EXIF tags\n         from \"src.jpg\".\n\n    exiftool -exif:all= -tagsfromfile\
  \ @ -all:all -unsafe bad.jpg\n         Rebuild all EXIF meta information from scratch\
  \ in an image. This\n         technique can be used in JPEG images to repair corrupted\
  \ EXIF\n         information which otherwise could not be written due to errors.\
  \ The\n         \"Unsafe\" tag is a shortcut for unsafe EXIF tags in JPEG images\
  \ which\n         are not normally copied. See the tag name documentation for more\n\
  \         details about unsafe tags.\n\n    exiftool -Tagsfromfile a.jpg out.xmp\n\
  \         Copy meta information from \"a.jpg\" to an XMP data file. If the XMP\n\
  \         data file \"out.xmp\" already exists, it will be updated with the new\n\
  \         information. Otherwise the XMP data file will be created. Only\n     \
  \    metadata-only files may be created like this (files containing images\n   \
  \      may be edited but not created). See \"WRITING EXAMPLES\" above for\n    \
  \     another technique to generate XMP files.\n\n    exiftool -tagsFromFile a.jpg\
  \ -XMP:All= -ThumbnailImage= -m b.jpg\n         Copy all meta information from \"\
  a.jpg\" to \"b.jpg\", deleting all XMP\n         information and the thumbnail image\
  \ from the destination.\n\n    exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -title -author=Phil\
  \ dst.jpg\n         Copy title from one image to another and set a new author name.\n\
  \n    exiftool -TagsFromFile a.jpg -ISO -TagsFromFile b.jpg -comment dst.jpg\n \
  \        Copy ISO from one image and Comment from another image to a\n         destination\
  \ image.\n\n    exiftool -tagsfromfile src.jpg -exif:all --subifd:all dst.jpg\n\
  \         Copy only the EXIF information from one image to another, excluding\n\
  \         SubIFD tags.\n\n    exiftool '-FileModifyDate<DateTimeOriginal' dir\n\
  \         Use the original date from the meta information to set the same\n    \
  \     file's filesystem modification date for all images in a directory.\n     \
  \    (Note that \"-TagsFromFile @\" is assumed if no other \e[1m-TagsFromFile\e\
  [0m is\n         specified when redirecting information as in this example.)\n\n\
  \    exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg '-xmp:all<all' dst.jpg\n         Copy all possible\
  \ information from \"src.jpg\" and write in XMP format\n         to \"dst.jpg\"\
  .\n\n    exiftool '-Description<${FileName;s/\\.[^.]*$//}' dir\n         Set the\
  \ image Description from the file name after removing the\n         extension. This\
  \ example uses the \"Advanced formatting feature\" to\n         perform a substitution\
  \ operation to remove the last dot and\n         subsequent characters from the\
  \ file name.\n\n    exiftool -@ iptc2xmp.args -iptc:all= a.jpg\n         Translate\
  \ IPTC information to XMP with appropriate tag name\n         conversions, and delete\
  \ the original IPTC information from an image.\n         This example uses iptc2xmp.args,\
  \ which is a file included with the\n         ExifTool distribution that contains\
  \ the required arguments to convert\n         IPTC information to XMP format. Also\
  \ included with the distribution\n         are xmp2iptc.args (which performs the\
  \ inverse conversion) and a few\n         more .args files for other conversions\
  \ between EXIF, IPTC and XMP.\n\n    exiftool -tagsfromfile %d%f.CR2 -r -ext JPG\
  \ dir\n         Recursively rewrite all \"JPG\" images in \"dir\" with information\
  \ copied\n         from the corresponding \"CR2\" images in the same directories.\n\
  \n    exiftool '-keywords+<make' image.jpg\n         Add camera make to list of\
  \ keywords.\n\n    exiftool '-comment<ISO=$exif:iso Exposure=${shutterspeed}' dir\n\
  \         Set the Comment tag of all images in \"dir\" from the values of the\n\
  \         EXIF:ISO and ShutterSpeed tags. The resulting comment will be in the\n\
  \         form \"ISO=100 Exposure=1/60\".\n\n    exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg\
  \ -icc_profile dst.jpg\n         Copy ICC_Profile from one image to another.\n\n\
  \    exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -all:all dst.mie\n         Copy all meta information\
  \ in its original form from a JPEG image to a\n         MIE file. The MIE file will\
  \ be created if it doesn't exist. This\n         technique can be used to store\
  \ the metadata of an image so it can be\n         inserted back into the image (with\
  \ the inverse command) later in a\n         workflow.\n\n    exiftool -o dst.mie\
  \ -all:all src.jpg\n         This command performs exactly the same task as the\
  \ command above,\n         except that the \e[1m-o\e[0m option will not write to\
  \ an output file that\n         already exists.\n\n    exiftool -b -jpgfromraw -w\
  \ %d%f_%ue.jpg -execute -b -previewimage -w\n    %d%f_%ue.jpg -execute -tagsfromfile\
  \ @ -srcfile %d%f_%ue.jpg\n    -overwrite_original -common_args --ext jpg DIR\n\
  \         [Advanced] Extract JpgFromRaw or PreviewImage from all but JPG files\n\
  \         in DIR, saving them with file names like \"image_EXT.jpg\", then add\n\
  \         all meta information from the original files to the extracted images.\n\
  \         Here, the command line is broken into three sections (separated by\n \
  \        \e[1m-execute\e[0m options), and each is executed as if it were a separate\n\
  \         command. The \e[1m-common_args\e[0m option causes the \"--ext jpg DIR\"\
  \ arguments\n         to be applied to all three commands, and the \e[1m-srcfile\e\
  [0m option allows\n         the extracted JPG image to be the source file for the\
  \ third command\n         (whereas the RAW files are the source files for the other\
  \ two\n         commands).\n\n\e[1mRENAMING EXAMPLES\e[0m\n    By writing the \"\
  FileName\" and \"Directory\" tags, files are renamed and/or\n    moved to new directories.\
  \ This can be particularly useful and powerful for\n    organizing files by date\
  \ when combined with the \e[1m-d\e[0m option. New directories\n    are created as\
  \ necessary, but existing files will not be overwritten. The\n    format codes %d,\
  \ %f and %e may be used in the new file name to represent\n    the directory, name\
  \ and extension of the original file, and %c may be used\n    to add a copy number\
  \ if the file already exists (see the \e[1m-w\e[0m option for\n    details). Note\
  \ that if used within a date format string, an extra '%' must\n    be added to pass\
  \ these codes through the date/time parser. (And further\n    note that in a Windows\
  \ batch file, all '%' characters must also be\n    escaped, so in this extreme case\
  \ '%%%%f' is necessary to pass a simple\n    '%f' through the two levels of parsing.)\
  \ See\n    <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/filename.html> for additional\n\
  \    documentation and examples.\n\n    exiftool -filename=new.jpg dir/old.jpg\n\
  \         Rename \"old.jpg\" to \"new.jpg\" in directory \"dir\".\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -directory=%e dir\n         Move all files from directory \"dir\" into directories\
  \ named by the\n         original file extensions.\n\n    exiftool '-Directory<DateTimeOriginal'\
  \ -d %Y/%m/%d dir\n         Move all files in \"dir\" into a directory hierarchy\
  \ based on year,\n         month and day of \"DateTimeOriginal\". eg) This command\
  \ would move the\n         file \"dir/image.jpg\" with a \"DateTimeOriginal\" of\
  \ \"2005:10:12\n         16:05:56\" to \"2005/10/12/image.jpg\".\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -o . '-Directory<DateTimeOriginal' -d %Y/%m/%d dir\n         Same effect as above\
  \ except files are copied instead of moved.\n\n    exiftool '-filename<%f_${model;}.%e'\
  \ dir\n         Rename all files in \"dir\" by adding the camera model name to the\
  \ file\n         name. The semicolon after the tag name inside the braces causes\n\
  \         characters which are invalid in Windows file names to be deleted from\n\
  \         the tag value (see the \"Advanced formatting feature\" for an\n      \
  \   explanation).\n\n    exiftool '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S%%-c.%%e\
  \ dir\n         Rename all images in \"dir\" according to the \"CreateDate\" date\
  \ and\n         time, adding a copy number with leading '-' if the file already\n\
  \         exists (\"%-c\"), and preserving the original file extension (%e). Note\n\
  \         the extra '%' necessary to escape the filename codes (%c and %e) in\n\
  \         the date format string.\n\n    exiftool -r '-FileName<CreateDate' -d %Y-%m-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e\
  \ dir\n         Both the directory and the filename may be changed together via\
  \ the\n         \"FileName\" tag if the new \"FileName\" contains a '/'. The example\n\
  \         above recursively renames all images in a directory by adding a\n    \
  \     \"CreateDate\" timestamp to the start of the filename, then moves them\n \
  \        into new directories named by date.\n\n    exiftool '-FileName<${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg'\
  \ -d %Y%m%d -ext jpg .\n         Set the filename of all JPG images in the current\
  \ directory from the\n         CreateDate and FileNumber tags, in the form \"20060507_118-1861.jpg\"\
  .\n\n\e[1mGEOTAGGING EXAMPLES\e[0m\n    ExifTool implements geotagging via 3 special\
  \ tags: Geotag (which for\n    convenience is also implemented as an exiftool option),\
  \ Geosync and\n    Geotime. The examples below highlight some geotagging features.\
  \ See\n    <http://owl.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/geotag.html> for additional\n\
  \    documentation.\n\n    exiftool -geotag track.log a.jpg\n         Geotag an\
  \ image (\"a.jpg\") from position information in a GPS track\n         log (\"track.log\"\
  ). Since the \"Geotime\" tag is not specified, the\n         value of DateTimeOriginal\
  \ is used for geotagging. Local system time\n         is assumed unless DateTimeOriginal\
  \ contains a timezone.\n\n    exiftool -geotag t.log -geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12-05:00'\
  \ a.jpg\n         Geotag an image with the GPS position for a specific time.\n\n\
  \    exiftool -geotag log.gpx '-xmp:geotime<createdate' dir\n         Geotag all\
  \ images in directory \"dir\" with XMP tags instead of EXIF\n         tags, based\
  \ on the image CreateDate.\n\n    exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=-20 dir\n    \
  \     Geotag images in directory \"dir\", accounting for image timestamps\n    \
  \     which were 20 seconds ahead of GPS.\n\n    exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=1.jpg\
  \ -geosync=2.jpg dir\n         Geotag images using time synchronization from two\
  \ previously\n         geotagged images (1.jpg and 2.jpg), synchronizing the image\
  \ and GPS\n         times using a linear time drift correction.\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -geotag a.log '-geotime<${createdate}+01:00' dir\n         Geotag images in \"\
  dir\" using CreateDate with the specified timezone.\n         If CreateDate already\
  \ contained a timezone, then the timezone\n         specified on the command line\
  \ is ignored.\n\n    exiftool -geotag= a.jpg\n         Delete GPS tags which may\
  \ have been added by the geotag feature. Note\n         that this does not remove\
  \ all GPS tags -- to do this instead use\n         \"-gps:all=\".\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -xmp:geotag= a.jpg\n         Delete XMP GPS tags which were added by the geotag\
  \ feature.\n\n    exiftool -xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg\n         Geotag an image\
  \ with XMP tags, using the time from DateTimeOriginal.\n\n    exiftool -geotag a.log\
  \ -geotag b.log -r dir\n         Combine multiple track logs and geotag an entire\
  \ directory tree of\n         images.\n\n    exiftool -geotag 'tracks/*.log' -r\
  \ dir\n         Read all track logs from the \"tracks\" directory.\n\n    exiftool\
  \ -p gpx.fmt -d %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ dir > out.gpx\n         Generate a GPX track\
  \ log from all images in directory \"dir\". This\n         example uses the \"gpx.fmt\"\
  \ file included in the full ExifTool\n         distribution package and assumes\
  \ that the images in \"dir\" have all\n         been previously geotagged.\n\n\e\
