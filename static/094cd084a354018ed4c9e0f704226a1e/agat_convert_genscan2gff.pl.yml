  \n\nName:\n    agat_convert_genscan2gff.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script takes\
  \ a genscan file as input, and will translate it in gff\n    format. The genscan\
  \ format is described here:\n    http://genome.crg.es/courses/Bioinformatics2003_genefinding/results/gens\n\
  \    can.html /!\\ vvv Known problem vvv /!\\ You must have submited only DNA\n\
  \    sequence, wihtout any header!! Indeed the tool expects only DNA\n    sequences\
  \ and does not crash/warn if an header is submited along the\n    sequence. e.g\
  \ If you have an header \">seq\" s-e-q are seen as the 3 first\n    nucleotides\
  \ of the sequence. Then all prediction location are shifted\n    accordingly. (checked\
  \ only on the online version\n    http://argonaute.mit.edu/GENSCAN.html. I don't\
  \ know if there is the same\n    pronlem elsewhere.) /!\\ ^^^ Known problem ^^^^\

  \ -g\n            Input bed file that will be convert.\n\n    --source\n       \
  \     The source informs about the tool used to produce the data and\n         \
  \   is stored in 2nd field of a gff file. Example:\n            Stringtie,Maker,Augustus,etc.\
  \ [default: data]\n\n    --primary_tag\n            The primary_tag corresponf to\
  \ the data type and is stored in 3rd\n            field of a gff file. Example:\
  \ gene,mRNA,CDS,etc. [default: gene]\n\n    --inflate_off\n            By default\
