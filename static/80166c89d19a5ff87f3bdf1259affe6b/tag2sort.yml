help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\n  This script processes allele tagged input files produced\
  \ by SNPsplit and sorts the 'allele_tagged.bam'\n  file into several sub-files,\
  \ depending on the experiment type and options selected. By default reads are\n\
  \  written to the following files:\n\n   ... _genome1.bam\n   ... _genome2.bam\n\
  \   ... _unassigned.bam\n\n  For more information on sorting options pelase refer\
  \ to the SNPsplit documentation.\n\n\n  USAGE: tag2sort [options] [SNPsplit tagged\
  \ input file(s)]\n\nSNPsplit tagged input file(s): These files are required to be\
  \ SAM/BAM files that contain the\noptional field XX:Z: produced by the SNPsplit-flag\
  \ module. The tags indicate if a read could\nbe assigned to a specific allele, and\
  \ they are one of the following:\n\n                             XX:Z:UA - Unassigned\n\
  \                             XX:Z:G1 - Genome 1-specific\n                    \
  \         XX:Z:G2 - Genome 2-specific\n                             XX:Z:CF - Conflicting\n\
  \n--paired               Paired-end mode. (Default: OFF).\n\n-o/--outdir <dir> \
  \     Write all output files into this directory. By default the output files will\
  \ be written into\n                       the same folder as the input file(s).\n\
  \n--singletons           If the allele-tagged paired-end file also contains singleton\
  \ alignments (which is the\n                       default for e.g. TopHat), these\
  \ will be written out to extra files (ending in _st.bam)\n                     \

  \n--conflicting/--weird  Reads or read pairs that were classified as 'Conflicting'\
