  ______________________________________/ KronaTools 2.7.1 - ktImportTaxonomy \\___\n\
  \nCreates a Krona chart based on taxonomy IDs and, optionally, magnitudes and\n\
  scores. Taxonomy IDs corresponding to a rank of \"no rank\" in the database will\n\
  be assigned to their parents to make the hierarchy less cluttered (e.g.\n\"Cellular\
  \ organisms\" will be assigned to \"root\").\n                                 \

  \ Options \\___\n\n   [-o <string>]    Output file name. [Default: 'taxonomy.krona.html']\n\
  \n   [-n <string>]    Name of the highest level. [Default: 'Root']\n\n   [-i]  \
  \           Include a wedge for queries with no hits.\n\n   [-c]             Combine\
  \ data from each file, rather than creating separate\n                    datasets\
  \ within the chart.\n\n   [-q <integer>]   Column of input files to use as query\
  \ ID. Required if\n                    magnitude files are specified. [Default:\
  \ '1']\n\n   [-t <integer>]   Column of input files to use as taxonomy ID. [Default:\n\

  \ those\n                    in this column.\n\n   [-d <integer>]   Maximum depth\
  \ of wedges to include in the chart.\n\n   [-k]             Show the \"cellular\
  \ organisms\" taxon (collapsed by\n                    default).\n\n   [-K]    \
  \         Collapse assignments to taxa with ranks labeled \"no rank\"\n        \

  \ [Default: '120']\n\n   [-u <string>]    URL of Krona resources to use instead\
  \ of bundling them\n                    with the chart (e.g. \"http://krona.sourceforge.net\"\
  ).\n                    Reduces size of charts and allows updates, though charts\n\
  \                    will not work without access to this URL.\n\n   [-qp <string>]\
  \   Url to send query IDs to (instead of listing them) for\n                   \
  \ each wedge. The query IDs will be sent as a comma separated\n                \
