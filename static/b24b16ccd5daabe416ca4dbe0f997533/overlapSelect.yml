help_text: "wrong # args:  overlapSelect [options] selectFile inFile outFile\n\nSelect\
  \ records based on overlapping chromosome ranges.  The ranges are\nspecified in\
  \ the selectFile, with each block specifying a range.\nRecords are copied from the\
  \ inFile to outFile based on the selection\ncriteria.  Selection is based on blocks\
  \ or exons rather than entire\nrange.\n\nOptions starting with -select* apply to\
  \ selectFile and those starting\nwith -in* apply to inFile.\n\nOptions:\n  -selectFmt=fmt\
  \ - specify selectFile format:\n          psl - PSL format (default for *.psl files).\n\
  \          pslq - PSL format, using query instead of target\n          genePred\
  \ - genePred format (default for *.gp or\n                     *.genePred files).\n\
  \          bed - BED format (default for *.bed files).\n                If BED doesn't\
  \ have blocks, the bed range is used. \n          chain - chain file format (default\
  \ from .chain files)\n          chainq - chain file format, using query instead\
  \ of target\n  -selectCoordCols=spec - selectFile is tab-separate with coordinates\n\
  \       as described by spec, which is one of:\n            o chromCol - chrom in\
  \ this column followed by start and end.\n            o chromCol,startCol,endCol,strandCol,name\
  \ - chrom, start, end, and\n              strand in specified columns. Columns can\
  \ be omitted from the end\n              or left empty to not specify.\n       \
  \   NOTE: column numbers are zero-based\n  -selectCds - Use only CDS in the selectFile\n\
  \  -selectRange - Use entire range instead of blocks from records in\n         \
  \ the selectFile.\n  -inFmt=fmt - specify inFile format, same values as -selectFmt.\n\
  \  -inCoordCols=spec - inFile is tab-separate with coordinates specified by\n  \
  \    spec, in format described above.\n  -inCds - Use only CDS in the inFile\n \
  \ -inRange - Use entire range instead of blocks of records in the inFile.\n  -nonOverlapping\
  \ - select non-overlapping instead of overlapping records\n  -strand - must be on\
  \ the same strand to be considered overlapping\n  -oppositeStrand - must be on the\
  \ opposite strand to be considered overlapping\n  -excludeSelf - don't compare records\
  \ with the same coordinates and name.\n      Warning: using only one of -inCds or\
  \ -selectCds will result in different\n      coordinates for the same record.\n\
  \  -idMatch - only select overlapping records if they have the same id\n  -aggregate\
  \ - instead of computing overlap bases on individual select entries, \n      compute\
  \ it based on the total number of inFile bases overlap by selectFile\n      records.\
  \ -overlapSimilarity and -mergeOutput will not work with\n      this option.\n \
  \ -overlapThreshold=0.0 - minimum fraction of an inFile record that\n      must\
  \ be overlapped by a single select record to be considered\n      overlapping. \
  \ Note that this is only coverage by a single select\n      record, not total coverage.\n\
  \  -overlapThresholdCeil=1.1 - select only inFile records with less than\n     \
  \ this amount of overlap with a single record, provided they are selected\n    \
  \  by other criteria.\n  -overlapSimilarity=0.0 - minimum fraction bases in inFile\
  \ and selectFile\n      records that overlap the same genomic locations.  This is\
  \ computed\n      by (2*overlapBase)/(inFileBase+selectFileBases).\n      Note that\
  \ this is only coverage by a single select record and this\n      is bidirectional\
  \ inFile and selectFile must overlap by this\n      amount.  A value of 1.0 will\
  \ select identical records (or CDS if\n      both CDS options are specified.  Not\
  \ currently supported with\n      -aggregate.\n  -overlapSimilarityCeil=1.1 - select\
  \ only inFile records with less than this\n      amount of similarity with a single\
  \ record. provided they are selected by\n      other criteria.\n  -overlapBases=-1\
  \ - minimum number of bases of overlap, < 0 disables.\n  -statsOutput - output overlap\
  \ statistics instead of selected records. \n      If no overlap criteria is specified,\
  \ all overlapping entries are\n      reported, Otherwise only the pairs passing\
  \ the criteria are\n      reported. This results in a tab-separated file with the\
  \ columns:\n         inId selectId inOverlap selectOverlap overBases\n      Where\
  \ inOverlap is the fraction of the inFile record overlapped by\n      the selectFile\
  \ record and selectOverlap is the fraction of the\n      select record overlap by\
  \ inFile records.  With -aggregate, output\n      is:\n         inId inOverlap inOverBases\
  \ inBases\n  -statsOutputAll - like -statsOutput, however output all inFile records,\n\
  \      including those that are not overlapped.\n  -statsOutputBoth - like -statsOutput,\
  \ however output all selectFile and\n      inFile records, including those that\
  \ are not overlapped.\n  -mergeOutput - output file with be a merge of the input\
  \ file with the\n      selectFile records that selected it.  The format is\n   \
  \      inRec<tab>selectRec.\n      if multiple select records hit, inRec is repeated.\
  \ This will increase\n      the memory required. Not supported with -nonOverlapping\
  \ or -aggregate.\n  -idOutput - output a tab-separated file of pairs of\n      \
  \   inId selectId\n      with -aggregate, only a single column of inId is written\n\
  \  -dropped=file  - output rows that were dropped to this file.\n  -verbose=n -\
  \ verbose > 1 prints some details,\n\n"
