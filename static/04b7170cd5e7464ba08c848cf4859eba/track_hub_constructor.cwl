inputs:
- id: gi
  doc: Genome id as used in UCSC assembly hub. Must be correct, otherwise the annotation
    cannot be mapped on the genome.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --gi
- id: in_folder
  doc: Directory which contains all track files in BED/bigBed format. The resulting
    Track Hub will contain these files in their respective bigFile version.

  type: boolean

- id: baseurl
  doc: BaseURL used within the Track Hub. This URL will be included verbatim in the

    Track Hub will be broken.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --baseurl
- id: big_beds
  doc: 'URLs pointing to big bed files to be included in the trackhub. Multiple URLs
    are separated by the character #.'
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --bigbeds
- id: bigwigs
  doc: 'URLs pointing to big wig files to be included in the trackhub. Multiple URLs
    are separated by the star character #. It is possible to create a multiwig container
    by providing 2 URLs instead of one separated by comma character ,. E.g. http://foo.com/bar.bw,http://foo.com/bar2.bw#http://foo.com/bar3.bw
    yields a multi big wig container displaying bar as positive reads in green and
    bar2 as negative 3 red colored reads in the same track and additionally bar3 in
    an own track colored blue.'
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --bigwigs
