help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified October 22, 2015\n\nDescription:\
  \  Generates synthetic reads following an MDA-amplified single cell's coverage distribution.\n\
  \nUsage:  synthmda.sh in=<reference> out=<reads out file>\n\nInput may be fasta\
  \ or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.\n\nParameters:\nreads=12000000      Generate\
  \ this many reads.\npaired=t            Generate paired reads.\nlength=150     \
  \     Reads should be this long.\nminlen=4000         Min length of MDA contig.\n\
  maxlen=150000       Max length of MDA contig.\ncycles=9            Number of MDA\
  \ cycles; higher is more spiky.\ninitialratio=1.3    Fraction of genome initially\
  \ replicated; \n                    lower is more spiky.\nratio=1.7           Fraction\
  \ of genome replicated per cycle.\nrefout=null         Write MDA'd genome to this\
  \ file.\nperfect=0           This fraction of reads will be error-free.\namp=200\
  \             'amp' flag sent to RandomReads (higher is more spiky).\nbuild=7  \
  \           Index MDA'd genome in this location.\nprefix=null         Generated\
  \ reads will start with this prefix.\noverwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force\
  \ the program to abort rather \n                    than overwrite an existing file.\n\
  \nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx                This will set Java's memory usage, overriding\
  \ autodetection.\n                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m\
  \ will specify 200 megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical\
  \ memory.\n-eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n\
  \                    out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da\
  \                 Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
