  description: Minimum length of contigs to keep (contigs shorter than this value
    will not be included in the output file). The default is 0, so nothing will be
    removed if you do not declare a minimum size.
  synonyms:

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: MIN_LENGTH
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Maximum fraction of gaps in a sequence (any sequence with more gaps
    will be removed from the output FASTA file). The default is 100.000000.
  synonyms:
  - --max-percentage-gaps
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: PERCENTAGE
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: FILE, --exclude-ids TXT FILE IDs to remove from the FASTA file. You
    cannot provide both --keep-ids and --exclude-ids.
  synonyms:
  - -i
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: TXT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: FILE, --keep-ids TXT FILE If provided, all IDs not in this file will
    be excluded from the reformatted FASTA file. Any additional filters (such as --min-len)
    will still be applied to the IDs in this file. You cannot provide both --exclude-ids
    and --keep-ids.
  synonyms:
  - -I
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: TXT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: FILE, --output-file FASTA FILE Output file path.
  synonyms:
  - -o
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: FASTA
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Edit deflines to make sure they contigs have simple names.
  synonyms:
  - --simplify-names
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Use this parameter if you would like to add a prefix to your contig
    names while simplifying them. The prefix must be a single word (you can use underscor
    character, but nothing more!).
  synonyms:
  - --prefix
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: PREFIX
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: FILE, --report-file REPORT FILE Report file path. When you run this
    program with `--simplify-names` flag, all changes to deflines will be reported
    in this file in case you need to go back to this information later. It is not
    mandatory to declare one, but it is a very good idea to have it.
