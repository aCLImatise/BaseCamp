help_text: "Usage: ./pirs simulate [OPTION]... REFERENCE.FASTA...\n\npIRS is a program\
  \ for simulating paired-end reads from a genome.  It is\noptimized for simulating\
  \ reads from the Illumina platform.  The input to\npIRS is any number of reference\
  \ sequences. Typically you would just provide\none FASTA file containing your reference\
  \ sequence, but you may provide two\nif you have generated a diploid sequence with\
  \ `pirs diploid', or if you have\nchromosomes split up into multiple FASTA files.\
  \  The output of pIRS is two\nFASTQ files containing the simulated paired-end reads,\
  \ as well as several log\nfiles.\n\nInput sequences are assumed to be haploid. \
  \ If you instead want to simulate\nreads from a diploid genome, you must give the\
  \ --diploid option so that\nthe diploidy is taken into account when computing coverage.\
  \  If you do\nnot do this, you will get twice as many reads as you wanted.\n\npIRS\
  \ simulates a normally-distributed insert (fragment) length using the\nBox-muller\
  \ method.  Usually you want the insert length standard deviation to\nbe 1/20 or\
  \ 1/10 of the insert length mean (see the -m and -v options).\nThis program also\
  \ simulates Illumina sequencing error, quality score and\nGC bias based on empirical\
  \ distribution profiles. Users may use the default\nprofiles in this package, which\
  \ are generated by large real sequencing data,\nor they may generate their own profiles.\n\
  \nOPTIONS:\n  -l LEN, --read-len=LEN\n                Generate reads having a length\
  \ of LEN.  Default: 100\n\n  -x VAL, --coverage=VAL\n                 Set the average\
  \ sequencing coverage (sometimes called depth).\n                 It may be either\
  \ a floating-point number or an integer.\n\n  -m LEN, --insert-len-mean=LEN\n  \
  \               Generate inserts (fragments) having an average length of LEN.\n\
  \                 Default: 180\n\n  -v LEN, --insert-len-sd=LEN\n              \
  \   Set the standard deviation of the insert (fragment) length.\n              \
  \   Default: 10% of insert length mean.\n\n  -j, --jumping, --cyclicize\n      \
  \           Make the paired-end reads face away from either other, as\n        \
  \         in a jumping library.  Default: the reads face towards each\n        \
  \         other.\n\n  -d, --diploid\n                 This option asserts that reads\
  \ are being simulated from a\n                 diploid genome.  It causes the program\
  \ to abort if there\n                 are not exactly two reference sequences; in\
  \ addition, the\n                 coverage is divided in half, since the two reference\n\
  \                 sequences are in reality the same genome.  This option\n     \
  \            is not required to simulate diploid reads, but you must\n         \
  \        set the coverage correctly otherwise (it will be half\n               \
  \  as much as you think).\n\n  -B FILE, --base-calling-profile=FILE, --subst-error-profile=FILE\n\
  \                 Use FILE as the base-calling profile.  This profile will be\n\

  \     /tmp/tmp4w54sl6m/share/pirs/Base-Calling_Profiles/humNew.PE100.matrix.gz\n\
  \n  -I FILE, --indel-error-profile=FILE, --indel-profile=FILE\n                \
  \ Use FILE as the indel-error profile.  This profile will be\n                 used\
  \ to simulate insertions and deletions in the reads that\n                 are artifacts\
  \ of the sequencing process.  Default:\n                 /tmp/tmp4w54sl6m/share/pirs/InDel_Profiles/phixv2.InDel.matrix\n\

  \ --subst-error-rate=RATE\n                 Set the substitution error rate.  The\
  \ base-calling profile\n                 will still be used, but the average frequency\
  \ of errors will\n                 be changed to RATE.  Set to 0 to disable substitution\
  \ errors\n                 completely.  In that case, the base-calling profile will\
  \ not\n                 be used.  Default: default error rate of base-calling\n\
  \                 profile.\n\n                 Note: since pIRS parameterizes the\
  \ error rate by\n                 several parameters, it is very difficult to determine\
  \ exactly\n                 what needs to be done to make the error rate be a given\n\
  \                 value.  We try to adjust the probabilities of getting each\n \
  \                quality score in order to accomodate the user-supplied error\n\
  \                 rate.  However, depending on your input sequences, the actual\n\
  \                 error rate simulated by pIRS could be off by 20% or more.\n  \
  \               Please check the informational output to see the final error\n \
  \                rate that was actually simulated.\n\n  -A ALGO, --substitution-error-algorithm=ALGO,\
  \ --subst-error-algo=ALGO\n                 Set the algorithm used for simulating\
  \ substitition errors.\n                 It may be set to the string \"dist\" or\
  \ \"qtrans\".  The\n                 default is \"qtrans\".\n\n                \
  \ The \"dist\" algorithm looks up the substitution error rate\n                \
  \ for each base pair based on the current cycle and the true\n                 base.\
  \  This lookup produces a quality score and a called base\n                 that\
  \ may or may not be the same as the true base.  In the\n                 base-calling\
  \ profile, the matrix we use is marked as the\n                 [DistMatrix].\n\n\
  \                 The \"qtrans\" algorithm is a Markov-chain model based on the\n\
  \                 previous quality score and current cycle.  The next quality\n\
  \                 score is looked up with a certain probability based on these\n\
  \                 parameters.  The matrix used for this is marked as\n         \
  \        [QTransMatrix] in the base-calling profile. Then, the the\n           \
  \      DistMatrix is used to find a called base for the quality score.\n       \
  \          The DistMatrix is also used to call the base in the first\n         \
  \        cycle.\n\n  -M MODE, --mask=MODE, --eamss=MODE\n                 Use the\
  \ EAMSS algorithm for masking read quality.  MODE may be\n                 the string\
  \ \"quality\" or \"lowercase\".  The EAMSS algorithm\n                 identifies\
  \ low-quality, GC-rich regions near the ends of reads.\n                 \"quality\"\
  \ mode will change the quality scores on these\n                 regions to (2 +\
  \ quality_shift), while \"lowercase\" mode\n                 will change the base\
  \ pairs to lower case, but not change\n                 the quality values.  Default:\
  \ Do not use EAMSS.\n\n  -Q VAL, --quality-shift=VAL, --phred-offset=VAL\n     \
  \            Set the ASCII shift of the quality value (usually 64 or 33 for\n  \
  \               Illumina data).  Default: 33\n\n  --no-quality-values\n  --fasta\n\
  \                 Do not simulate quality values.  The simulated reads will be\n\
  \                 written as a FASTA file rather than a FASTQ file.\n          \
  \       Substitution errors may still be done; if you do not want\n            \
  \     to simulate any substition errors, provide --error-rate=0 or\n           \
  \      --no-substitution-errors.\n\n  --no-subst-errors\n  --no-substitution-errors\n\
  \                 Do not simulate substitution errors.  Equivalent to\n        \
  \         --error-rate=0.\n\n  --no-indels\n  --no-indel-errors\n              \
  \   Do not simulate indels.  The indel error profile will not be\n             \
  \    used.\n\n  --no-gc-bias\n  --no-gc-content-bias\n                 Do not simulate\
  \ GC bias.  The GC bias profile will not be\n                 used.\n\n  -o PREFIX,\
  \ --output-prefix=PREFIX\n                 Use PREFIX as the prefix of the output\
  \ files.  Default:\n                 \"pirs_reads\"\n\n  -c TYPE, --output-file-type=TYPE\n\
  \                 The string \"text\" or \"gzip\" to specify the type of\n     \
  \            the output FASTQ files containing the simulated reads\n           \
  \      of the genome, as well as the log files.  Default: \"text\"\n\n  -z, --compress\n\
  \                 Equivalent to -c gzip.\n\n  -n, --no-logs, --no-log-files\n  \
  \               Do not write the log files.\n\n  -S SEED, --random-seed=SEED\n \
  \                Use SEED as the random seed. Default:\n                 time(NULL)\
  \ * getpid().  Note: If pIRS was not compiled with\n                 --disable-threads,\
  \ each thread actually uses its own random\n                 number generator that\
  \ is seeded by this base seed added to\n                 the thread number; also,\
  \ if you need pIRS's output to be\n                 exactly reproducible, you must\
  \ specify the random seed as well\n                 as use only 1 simulator thread\
  \ (--threads=1, or configure\n                 with --disable-threads, or run on\
  \ system with 4 or fewer\n                 processors).\n\n  -t, --threads=NUM_THREADS\n\
  \                 Use NUM_THREADS threads to simulate reads.  This option is\n \
  \                not available if pIRS was compiled with the --disable-threads\n\
  \                 option.  Default: number of processors minus 2 if writing\n  \
  \               uncompressed output, or number of processors minus 3 if\n      \
  \           writing compressed output, or 1 if there are not this many\n       \
  \          processors.\n\n  -q, --quiet    Do not print informational messages.\n\
  \n  -h, --help     Show this help and exit.\n\n  -V, --version  Show version information\
