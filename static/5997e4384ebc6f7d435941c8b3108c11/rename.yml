help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 1, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Renames reads to <prefix>_<number> where you specify the prefix\nand the numbers\
  \ are ordered.  There are other renaming modes too.\nIf reads are paired, pairs\
  \ should be processed together; if reads are \ninterleaved, the interleaved flag\
  \ should be set.  This ensures that if a\nread number (such as 1: or 2:) is added,\
  \ it will be added correctly.\n\nUsage:  rename.sh in=<file> in2=<file2> out=<outfile>\
  \ out2=<outfile2> prefix=<>\n\nin2 and out2 are for paired reads and are optional.\n\
  If input is paired and there is only one output file, it will be written interleaved.\n\
  \nParameters:\nprefix=             The string to prepend to existing read names.\n\
  ow=f                (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.\nzl=4     \
  \           (ziplevel) Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).\nint=f       \
  \        (interleaved) Determines whether INPUT file is considered interleaved.\n\
  fastawrap=70        Length of lines in fasta output.\nminscaf=1           Ignore\
  \ fasta reads shorter than this.\nqin=auto            ASCII offset for input quality.\
  \  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto.\nqout=auto           ASCII offset\
  \ for output quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto (same as input).\n\
  ignorebadquality=f  (ibq) Fix out-of-range quality values instead of crashing with\
  \ a warning.\n\nRenaming modes (if not default):\nrenamebyinsert=f    Rename the\
  \ read to indicate its correct insert size.\nrenamebymapping=f   Rename the read\
  \ to indicate its correct mapping coordinates.\nrenamebytrim=f      Rename the read\
  \ to indicate its correct post-trimming length.\naddprefix=f         Rename the\
  \ read by prepending the prefix to the existing name.\nprefixonly=f        Only\
  \ use the prefix; don't add _<number>\naddunderscore=t     Add an underscore after\
  \ the prefix (if there is a prefix).\naddpairnum=t        Add a pairnum (e.g. '\
  \ 1:') to paired reads in some modes.\nfixsra=f            Fixes headers of SRA\
  \ reads renamed from Illumina.\n                    Specifically, it converts something\
  \ like this:\n                    SRR17611.11 HWI-ST79:17:D091UACXX:4:1101:210:824\
  \ length=75\n                    ...into this:\n                    HWI-ST79:17:D091UACXX:4:1101:210:824\
  \ 1:\n\nSampling parameters:\nreads=-1            Set to a positive number to only\
  \ process this many INPUT reads (or pairs), then quit.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx\
  \                This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n\
  \                    -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify\
  \ 200 megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n\
  -eoom               This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n           \
  \         out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da           \
  \      Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
