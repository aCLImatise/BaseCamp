  \nUses a measure called TAD-separation score to identify the degree of separation\
  \ between\nthe left and right regions at each Hi-C matrix bin. This is done for\
  \ a\nrunning window of different sizes. Then, TADs are called as those\npositions\
  \ having a local TAD-separation score minimum. The TAD-separation score is\nmeasured\
  \ using the z-score of the Hi-C matrix and is defined as the mean zscore of all\n\
  the matrix contacts between the left and right regions (diamond).\n\nTo find the\
  \ TADs, the program  needs to compute first the\nTAD scores at different window\
  \ sizes. Then, the results of that computation\nare used to call the TADs. This\
  \ is convenient to test different filtering criteria quickly\nas the demanding step\
  \ is the computation of TAD-separation scores.\n\n A simple example usage is:\n\n\
  $ hicFindTads -m hic_matrix.h5 --outPrefix TADs --correctForMultipleTesting fdr\n\
  \nThe bedgraph file produced by this tool can be used to plot the so-called insulation\
  \ score\nalong the genome or at specific regions. This score is much more reliable\
  \ across samples\nthan the number of TADs or the TADs width that can vary depending\
  \ on the sequencing depth because of the lack\nof information at certain bins, and\
