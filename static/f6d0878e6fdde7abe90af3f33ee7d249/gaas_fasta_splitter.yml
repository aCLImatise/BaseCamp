    attach: When the last chunk is more than 50% shorter of the --size_seq value we
    attach it to the previous chunk. In such case the last chunk of a split sequence
    can have as (rounded superior) maximum length: size_seq + (size_seq / 2) - 1 minimum
    length: (size_seq / 2) remove: The last chunk will be throw away if shorter than
    --size_seq value. detach: The last chunck stay as it is. In the worse case it
    can be 1 nucleotide long.'
