  description: The FASTA file that contains reference sequences you mapped your samples
    against. This could be a reference genome, or contigs from your assembler. Contig
    names in this file must match to those in other input files. If there is a problem
    anvi'o will gracefully complain about it.

  description: Name of the project. Please choose a short but descriptive name (so
    anvi'o can use it whenever she needs to name an output file, or add a new table
    in a database, or name her first born).

  description: A plain text file that contains some description about the project.
    You can use Markdwon syntax. The description text will be rendered and shown in
    all relevant interfaces, including the anvi'o interactive interface, or anvi'o
    summary outputs.

  description: Anvi'o splits very long contigs into smaller pieces, without actually
    splitting them for real. These 'virtual' splits improve the efficacy of the visualization
    step, and changing the split size gives freedom to the user to adjust the resolution
    of their display when necessary. The default value is (20000). If you are planning
    to use your contigs database for metagenomic binning, we advise you to not go
    below 10,000 (since the lower the split size is, the more items to show in the
    display, and decreasing the split size does not really help much to binning).
    But if you are thinking about using this parameter for ad hoc investigations other
    than binning, you should ignore our advice, and set the split size as low as you
    want. If you do not want your contigs to be split, you can set the split size
    to '0' or any other negative integer (lots of unnecessary freedom here, enjoy!).

  description: K-mer size for k-mer frequency calculations. The default k-mer size
    for composition-based analyses is 4, historically. Although tetra-nucleotide frequencies
    seem to offer the the sweet spot of sensitivity, information density, and manageable
    number of dimensions for clustering approaches, you are welcome to experiment
    (but maybe you should leave it as is for your first set of analyses).

  description: By default, anvi'o attempts to prevent soft-splitting large contigs
    by cutting proper gene calls to make sure a single gene is not broken into multiple
    splits. This requires a careful examination of where genes start and end, and
    to find best locations to split contigs with respect to this information. So,
    when the user asks for a split size of, say, 1,000, it serves as a mere suggestion.
    When this flag is used, anvi'o does what the user wants and creates splits at
    desired lengths (although some functionality may become unavailable for the projects
    that rely on a contigs database that is initiated this way).

  description: By default, generating an anvi'o contigs database includes the identification
    of open reading frames in contigs by running a bacterial gene caller. Declaring
    this flag will by-pass that process. If you prefer, you can later import your
    own gene calling results into the database.

  description: This is a parameter to pass to the Prodigal for a specific translation
    table. This parameter corresponds to the parameter `-g` in Prodigal, the default
    value of which is 11 (so if you do not set anything, it will be set to 11 in Prodigal
    runtime. Please refer to the Prodigal documentation to determine what is the right
    translation table for you if you think you need it.)

  description: This is only relevant when you have an external gene calls file. If
    anvi'o figures out that your custom gene calls result in amino acid sequences
    with stop codons in the middle, it will complain about it. You can use this flag
    to tell anvi'o to don't check for internal stop codons, EVEN THOUGH IT MEANS THERE
    IS MOST LIKELY SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR EXTERNAL GENE CALLS FILE. Anvi'o will
    understand that sometimes we don't want to care, and will not judge you. Instead,
    it will replace every stop codon residue in the amino acid sequence with an 'X'
    character. Please let us know if you used this and things failed, so we can tell
    you that you shouldn't have really used it if you didn't like failures at the
    first place (smiley).
