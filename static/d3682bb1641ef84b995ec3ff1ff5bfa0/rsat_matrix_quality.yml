  \ the quality of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM), by\n    comparing score\
  \ distributions obtained with this matrix in various\n    sequence sets.\n\n   \
  \ The most classical use of the program is to compare score distributions\n    between\
  \ \"positive\" sequences (e.g. true binding sites for the considered\n    transcription\
  \ factor) and \"negative\" sequences (e.g. intergenic\n    sequences between convergently\
  \ transcribed genes).\n\n  \e[1mPositive set : annotated binding sites\e[0m\n  \
  \  The typical positive set is a collection of sites that have been shown\n    (with\
  \ experimental methods) to bind the transcription factor of\n    interest.\n\n \
  \ \e[1mMatrix sites\e[0m\n    A particular case of postive control is to estimate\
  \ the distribution of\n    scores of the sites that served to build the matrix.\
  \ This however\n    provkes some bias (over-estimation of the scores), since the\
  \ matrix is\n    used to score the sites on which it was \"trained\". This bias\
  \ can be\n    circumvented by applying a cross-validation.\n\n  \e[1mCross-validation\e\
  [0m\n    An important bias of evaluation (and a frequent trap in published\n   \
  \ articles) can result from an over-fitting of the matrix to the positive\n    set,\
  \ in case one would use the same sites for building the PSSM and for\n    evaluating\
  \ it. To avoid this bias, \e[33mmatrix-quality\e[0m supports two modes of\n    cross-validation\
  \ (CV):\n\n     1. Leave-one-out (LOO)\n     2. k-fold cross-validation (kfold)\n\
  \n    The cross-validation can only be performed when the matrix is specified\n\
  \    in a format that includes both the matrix and the sites (sequences) that\n\
  \    were used to build this matrix. This is the case for matrices in MEME,\n  \
  \  consensus, transfac and MotifSampler formats.\n\n   k-fold cross-validation\n\
  \    The set of input sequence (matrix site sequences) is partitionned into k\n\
  \    randomly selected subets of approx. equal size (the number of sites is\n  \
  \  not always an exact multiple of k).\n\n    The program then iterates over the\
  \ testing set in the following way. All\n    the sites that are not part of the\
  \ testing sets are used as trianing\n    sites to build a partial matrix. The testing\
  \ sites are then scored with\n    this partial matrix.\n\n   Leave-One-Out (LOO)\
  \ test\n    In LOO cross-validation mode, one sequence (the \"left-out sequence\"\
  ) is\n    temporarily discarded from the positive set, and the remaining sequences\n\
  \    are used to build a matrix, which is then used to score the left out\n    sequence.\
  \ The process iterates over all the sequences of the positive\n    set.\n\n    If\
  \ the left-out sequence has one or more \"twin\" (identical site) in the\n    positive\
  \ set, they are also temporarily excluded from the positive set\n    and not included\
  \ in the matrix used to score the left out sequence.\n\n   LOO or k-fold ?\n   \
  \ The LOO is actually a particular case of k-fold cross-validation, where\n    k\
  \ equals the total number of sites used to build the original matrix.\n    The LOO\
  \ is particularly adapted for matrices built from a very small\n    number of sites\
  \ (e.g. matrices built from a handful of well-documented\n    sites as usually found\
  \ in transcription factor databases).\n\n    On the contrary, the k-fold cross-validation\
  \ is useful to save computing\n    time for matrices built from large collection\
  \ of sites (e.g. thousands\n    of sites resulting from ChIP-seq experiments).\n\
  \n  \e[1mNegative set\e[0m\n    It is sometimes difficult to find a good negative\
  \ set, i.e. a collection\n    of sequences which supposedly do not contain any binding\
  \ site for the\n    transcription factor of interest.\n\n   Random selection of\
  \ biological sequences\n    One possibility is to select a random set of genome\
  \ fragments (e.g. use\n    \e[33mrandom-genes\e[0m to select promoters of 100 randomly\
  \ selected genes).\n    However, some of these randomly selected sequences might\
  \ contain\n    effective binding sites for the transcripton factor.\n\n   Artificial\
  \ sequences\n    Another possiblity is to generate artificial sequences according\
  \ to some\n    background model (uing \e[33mrandom-seq\e[0m), but there is always\
  \ a risk that for\n    model to be an over-simplification of the real sequences.\n\
  \n   Biological sequences scanned with column-permuted matrices\n    Yet another\
  \ approach to perform the negative test os to scan biological\n    sequences (e.g.\
  \ upstream regions of 100 randomly picked genes) with\n    column-permuted matrices.\
  \ The advantage of this approach is that the\n    sequences are realistic, but the\
  \ permuted matrices hopefully do not\n    correspond to any actual motif, and their\
  \ empirical distribution\n    observed in the test sequences is thus supposed to\
  \ fit the theoretcial\n    distribution.\n\n    This approach may however pose problem\
  \ in the specific case of\n    weak-complexity motifs (e.g. CCGCCC, AATTTT), since\
  \ many permutations\n    will give motifs that are similar, if not equal, to the\
  \ original motif.\n\n\e[1mHOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM ?\e[0m\n    Let us be frank, this\
  \ program can do many things, but requires a bit of\n    expertise. A good strategy\
  \ to get familiar with its multiple results is\n    to start runing the simplest\
  \ possible analysis, and progressively adding\n    the more advanced tasks.\n\n\
  \    We propose hereafter a step-by-step schedule of utilization, where\n    subsequent\
  \ tasks are progressively added.\n\n    We assume here that the user disposes of\
  \ a PSSM in a format that\n    includes both the matrix and the aligned sites used\
  \ to compute the\n    matrix (e.g. MEME format). Beware, the sites actually incorporated\
  \ in\n    the matrix may differ frfom the collection of sites used as input for\n\
  \    the matrix-building program. For instance, if you use MEME (with the\n    option\
  \ -zoops) to build a matrix from a collection of annotated TFBS,\n    some sites\
  \ may be incorporated in the matrix, and some other skipped. We\n    use hereafter\
  \ the expression \e[1m\"matrix sites\"\e[0m to refer to the sites used\n    in the\
  \ alignment from which the residues frequencies of the matrix were\n    computed.\n\

  \ -no_cv -perm matrix_sites 0 -bgfile my_background.txt \\\n       -o my_matrix_quality\n\
  \n    This will produce the simplest possible analysis: computing the score\n  \
  \  distribution of the matrix sites, and comparing it to the theoretical\n    distribution.\n\
  \n    Beware: the score distribution of matrix sites is fake. Indeed, those\n  \
  \  are the very stes that were used to build the matrix. Each site partly\n    contributed\
  \ to the matrix scores (weights) that will serve to score it.\n    There is thus\
  \ a problem of over-fitting: we train a matrix with some\n    data, and we evaluate\
  \ the matrix with the same data.\n\n  \e[1mAssessing matrix sites with a Leave-One-Out\
  \ (LOO) procedure\e[0m\n    To circumvent the problem of over-fitting mentioned\
  \ above, we have need\n    to perform the Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure. Actually,\
  \ \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m\n    automatically runs the leave-one-out test by default.\
  \ The reason why it\n    was not done in the previous section is because we used\
  \ the option\n    -no_cv, for the only purpose of illustrating the problem of overfitting.\n\
  \    We will now run \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m in the normal way, without inactivating\
  \ the\n    LOO procedure.\n\n     matrix-quality -v 1 -ms my_matrix.meme -matrix_format\

  \ calculate the\n        statistical significance of the number of matches. This\
  \ allows to\n        select the score associated with te maximal significance, on\
  \ the\n        basis of the matrix-specific distribution, rather than by selecting\n\
  \        some a priori threshold.\n\n        Usage: -plot seq_type occ_proba\n\n\

  \ tasks\e[0m\n        Specify one or several tasks to be run. If this option is\
  \ not\n        specified, all the tasks are run.\n\n        Note that some tasks\
  \ depend on other ones. This option should thus\n        be used with caution, by\
  \ experimented users only.\n\n        Supported tasks:\n\n        \e[1mscan\e[0m\n\

  \       \e[1msynthesis\e[0m\n            Generate a HTML file with a synthetic report,\
  \ which displays the\n            main graphs (distribution curves and ROC curve)\
  \ and provides\n            links to the result files.\n\n            In order to\
  \ be correctly indexed, the graphs have to be\n            generated in png format.\n\
  \n        \e[1mplot\e[0m\n            Calculate the Normalized Weight Distance between\
  \ the theoretical\n            distribution and a score distribution in a specified\n\
  \            sequence_type\n\n            Calculate the OCC proba.\n\n    \e[1mBackground\
  \ model\e[0m\n        \e[33mmatrix-distrib\e[0m requires to specify a background\
  \ model, which will be\n        passed to \e[33mmatrix-distrib\e[0m and \e[33mmatrix-scan\e\
  [0m. This background model can\n        be specified with the same options as for\
  \ \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m.\n\n    \e[1mOther options\e[0m\n        All the other\
  \ options are automatically passed to \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m, in\n        order\
  \ to specify the scanning parameters (strands, background model,\n        ...).\n\
  \n        Note that the option '-return' of matrix-scan cannot be used here,\n \
  \       because matrix-quality specifies the return fields required for its\n  \
  \      statistics.\n\n        If the option '-bgfile' is specified, the specified\
  \ background model\n        will be used to calculate the matrix theoretical distribution.\
  \ If\n        another type of background model is specified for matrix-scan\n  \
  \      ('-bginput' or '-window'), use '-th_prior' option to specify the\n      \
  \  background model to be used for the calculation of the matrix\n        theoretical\
  \ distribution.\n\n\e[1mSEE ALSO\e[0m\n    \e[1mmatrix-scan\e[0m\n        Called\
