  \ alignment file from either nucmer or promer and\nfilters the alignments based\
  \ on the command-line switches, leaving\nonly the desired alignments which are output\
  \ to stdout in the same\ndelta format as the input. For multiple switches, order\
  \ of operations\nis as follows: -i -l -u -q -r -g -m -1. If an alignment is excluded\n\
  by a preceding operation, it will be ignored by the succeeding\noperations.\n  An\
  \ important distinction between the -g option and the -1 and -m\noptions is that\
  \ -g requires the alignments to be mutually consistent\nin their order, while the\
  \ -1 and -m options are not required to be\nmutually consistent and therefore tolerate\
  \ translocations,\ninversions, etc. In general cases, the -m option is the best\
  \ choice,\nhowever -1 can be handy for applications such as SNP finding which\n\
  require a 1-to-1 mapping. Finally, for mapping query contigs, or\nsequencing reads,\
  \ to a reference genome, use -q.\n\n"
