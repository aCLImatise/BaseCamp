positional: []
named:
- !Flag
  description: The input file in Bowtie MAP format (sorted by read name) containing
    the short reads mapped on the transcripts (can be also STDIN).
  synonyms:
  - --input
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INPUT_MAP_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The output text tab-separated file containing the candidate homologous
    genes (the genes are sorted alphabetically on the each line).
  synonyms:
  - --output
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The minimum number of reads which map simultaneously on two genes in
    order to be considered as homolog genes. Default is 1.
  synonyms:
  - --reads
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: READS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The output text file containing the reads names (and its mate) which
    mapp simultaneously on transcripts from at least two genes.
  synonyms:
  - --output_offending_pair_reads
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_OFFENDING_PAIR_READS_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Database with exons position on chromosomes, e.g. 'more_exons_ensembl.txt'.
    This is used for filtering the UTRs extensions by removing any extension which
    overlaps with any exons from the database. This is optional.
  synonyms:
  - --input_exons
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: EXONS_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Input file which contain a pattern for genes which should be ignored/skipped
    from the analysis.
  synonyms:
  - --filter
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: FILTER_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If it set then only the alignments of a read are taken into consideration
    which are at maximum zero mismatches away. This expects that the input has 4 columns
    instead of 3, and the fourth column contains the mismatches from Bowtie.
  synonyms:
  - --d0
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If it set then only the alignments of a read are taken into consideration
    which are at maximum one mismatch away. This works only for maximum two mismatches.
    This expects that the input has 4 columns instead of 3, and the fourth column
    contains the mismatches from Bowtie.
  synonyms:
  - --d1
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A file containing paths to candidate fusion genes and transcripts together
    with the ids/names of supporting reads.
  synonyms:
  - --output_saved_from_pseudogenes
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_SAVED_FROM_PSEUDOGENES_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The input database with gene ids of the pseudogenes.
  synonyms:
  - --input_pseudogenes
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INPUT_PSEUDOGENES_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Number of parallel processes/CPUs to be used for computations. In case
    of value 0 then the program will use all the CPUs which are found. The default
    value is 0.
  synonyms:
  - -p
  - --processes
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: PROCESSES
  optional: true
