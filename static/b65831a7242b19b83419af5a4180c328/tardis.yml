  description: Run the command as part of a workflow. After launching all of the jobs,
    tardis waits for all outputs, which are then collated and merged into a single
    output file, as specified by the output file path in the original command; all
    of the temporary input files (for example chunks of uncompressed fastq) are deleted
    provided all prior steps completed without error (if there was an error they are
    left there to assist with debugging). Without this option, the program exits immediately
    after launching all of the jobs, and output is left un-collated in the scratch
    folder created by this script, and no cleanup is done.

  description: When conditioning the input file(s), split into files each containing
    N logical records. (A logical record for a sequence file is a complete sequence.
    For a text file it is a line of text). (If the -s option is used to sample the
    inputs, the chunksize relates to the full un-sampled file . so the same chunk-size
    can be used whether random sampling or not. For example a chunksize of 1,000,000
    is specified in combination with a sampling rate of .0001, then each chunk would
    contain 100 sequences . i.e. you should not adjust the chunk-size, for the sampling
    rate. Note that to avoid a race-condition that could be caused by a very small
    chunk-size resulting in launching a very large number of jobs, tardis will throw
    an exception if the chunk- size used would result in launching more than MAX_DIMENSION
    jobs (currently 5000) )

  description: Rather than process the entire input file(s), a random sample of the
    records is processed. RATE is the probability that a given record will be sampled.
    For example -s .001 will result in roughly 1 in every 1000 logical records being
    sampled. When the -s option is specified, tardis does not clean up the conditioned
    input and output . e.g. all of the uncompressed fastq sample fragments would be
    retained. These are retained to assist with the Q/C work that is normally associated
    with a sampled run. Paired fastq input files are sampled in lock-step, provided
    the paired fastq conditioning directive is used for both files.
