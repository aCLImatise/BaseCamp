  description: One of the things anvi-profile does is to store information about variable
    nucleotide positions. Usually it does not report every variable position, since
    not every variable position is genuine variation. Say, if you have 1,000 coverage,
    and all nucleotides at that position are Ts and only one of them is a C, the confidence
    of that C being a real variation is quite low. anvi'o has a simple algorithm in
    place to reduce the impact of noise. However, using this flag you can disable
    it and ask profiler to report every single variation (which may result in very
    large output files and millions of reports, but you are the boss). Do not forget

  \   analysis.\n  --contigs-of-interest FILE\n                        It is possible\
  \ to analyze only a group of contigs from\n                        a given BAM file.\
  \ If you provide a text file, in which\n                        every contig of\
  \ interest is listed line by line, the\n                        profiler would engine\
  \ only on those contigs in the BAM\n                        file and ignore the\
  \ rest. This can be used for\n                        debugging purposes, or to\
  \ engine on a particular group\n                        of contigs that were identified\
  \ as relevant during the\n                        interactive analysis.\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\
  \  Performance settings for profiler\n\n  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS\n\
  \                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading\n \
  \                       whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is\n\
  \                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs\n\
  \                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with\n\
  \                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE\n\
  \                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for\n \
  \                       multiple threads to use, you may deplete your\n        \
  \                resources very fast.\n  --queue-size INT      The queue size for\
  \ worker threads to store data to\n                        communicate to the main\
  \ thread. The default is set by\n                        the class based on the\
  \ number of threads. If you have\n                        *any* hesitation about\
  \ whether you know what you are\n                        doing, you should not change\
  \ this value.\n  --write-buffer-size-per-thread INT\n                        How\
  \ many items should be kept in memory before they\n                        are written\
  \ do the disk. The default is 500 per\n                        thread. So a single-threaded\
  \ job would have a write\n                        buffer size of 500, whereas a\
  \ job with 4 threads would\n                        have a write buffer size of\
  \ 4*500. The larger the\n                        buffer size, the less frequent\
  \ the program will access\n                        to the disk, yet the more memory\
  \ will be consumed\n                        since the processed items will be cleared\
  \ off the\n                        memory only after they are written to the disk.\
  \ The\n                        default buffer size will likely work for most cases.\n\
  \                        Please keep an eye on the memory usage output to make\n\
  \                        sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the\n   \
  \                     physical memory.\n  --force-multi         This is not useful\
  \ to non-developers. It forces the\n                        multi-process routine\
  \ even when 1 thread is chosen.\n"
