help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 23, 2014\n\nDescription:\
  \  Grades mapping correctness of a sam file of synthetic reads with headers generated\
  \ by RandomReads3.java\n\nUsage:   gradesam.sh in=<sam file> reads=<number of reads>\n\
  \nParameters:\nin=<file>       Specify the input sam file, or stdin.\nreads=<int>\
  \     Number of reads in mapper's input (i.e., the fastq file).\nthresh=20     \
  \  Max deviation from correct location to be considered 'loosely correct'.\nblasr=f\
  \         Set to 't' for BLASR output; fixes extra information added to read names.\n\
  ssaha2=f        Set to 't' for SSAHA2 or SMALT output; fixes incorrect soft-clipped\
  \ read locations.\nquality=3       Reads with a mapping quality of this or below\
  \ will be considered ambiguously mapped.\nbitset=t        Track read ID's to detect\
  \ secondary alignments.\n                Necessary for mappers that incorrectly\
  \ output multiple primary alignments per read.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
