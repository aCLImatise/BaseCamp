  doc: Following write of the extensive form model, solve it.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --solve

    bilevel_ld, cbc, cplex, glpk, gurobi, mpec_minlp, mpec_nlp, openopt, os, path,
    pico, ps, py, scip, xpress; Default: cplex'
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --solver
- id: solver_io
  doc: 'The type of IO used to execute the solver.  Different solvers support different
    types of IO, but the following are common options: lp - generate LP files, nl
    - generate NL files, python - direct Python interface, os - generate OSiL XML
    files.'
  type: string

    (if specified), including the dispatch server, name server, and any mip servers.
    Default is False.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --shutdown-pyro
- id: output_file
  doc: The name of the extensive form output file (currently only LP and NL file formats
    are supported). If the option name does not end in '.lp' or '.nl', then the output
    format will be determined by the value of the --solver-io option, and the appropriate
    ending suffix will be added to the name. Default is 'efout'.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --output-file
- id: symbolic_solver_labels
  doc: When interfacing with the solver, use symbol names derived from the model.
    For example, "my_special_variable[1_2_3]" instead of "v1". Useful for debugging.
    When using the ASL interface (--solver- io=nl), generates corresponding .row (constraints)
    and .col (variables) files. The ordering in these files provides a mapping from
    ASL index to symbolic model names.
