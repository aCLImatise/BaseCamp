  description: A BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which features in -i should not
    be placed (e.g. gaps.bed).

  description: 'Instead of randomly placing features in a genome, the -incl options
    defines a BED/GFF/VCF file of coordinates in which  features in -i should be randomly
    placed (e.g. genes.bed).  Larger -incl intervals will contain more shuffled regions.  This
    method DISABLES -chromFirst. '

  description: 'Keep features in -i on the same chromosome. - By default, the chrom
    and position are randomly chosen. - NOTE: Forces use of -chromFirst (see below).'

    chosen automatically. - (INTEGER)

- !Flag
  description: Maximum overlap (as a fraction of the -i feature) with an -excl feature
    that is tolerated before searching for a new,  randomized locus. For example,
    -f 0.10 allows up to 10% of a randomized feature to overlap with a given feature
    in the -excl file. **Cannot be used with -incl file.** - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  optional: true

  description: Instead of choosing a position randomly among the entire genome (the
    default), first choose a chrom randomly, and then choose a random start coordinate
    on that chrom.  This leads to features being ~uniformly distributed among the
    chroms, as opposed to features being distribute as a function of chrom size.

  description: Max. number of attempts to find a home for a shuffled interval in the
    presence of -incl or -excl. Default = 1000.

  description: Don't allow shuffled intervals to overlap.

  - -noOverlapping
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Allow shuffled intervals to be relocated to a position in which the
    entire original interval cannot fit w/o exceeding the end of the chromosome.  In
    this case, the end coordinate of the shuffled interval will be set to the chromosome's
    length. By default, an interval's original length must be fully-contained within
    the chromosome.
