    used for read counting will be  extracted from annotation using the provided value.
  synonyms:
  - -t
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: string
  optional: true

  - -g
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: string
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Extract extra attribute types from the provided GTF annotation and
    include them in the counting output. These attribute types will not be used to
    group features. If more than one attribute type is provided they should be separated
    by comma.
  synonyms:
  - --extraAttributes
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Provide a chromosome name alias file to match chr names in annotation
    with those in the reads. This should be a two- column comma-delimited text file.
    Its first column should include chr names in the annotation and its second column
    should include chr names in the reads. Chr names are case sensitive. No column
    header should be included in the file.

  description: Perform read counting at feature level (eg. counting  reads for exons
    rather than genes).
  synonyms:
  - -f
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}

- !Flag
  description: <5:3>    Reduce reads to their 5' most base or 3' most base. Read counting
    is then performed based on the single base the  read is reduced to.
  synonyms:
  - --read2pos
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Multi-mapping reads will also be counted. For a multi- mapping read,
    all its reported alignments will be  counted. The 'NH' tag in BAM/SAM input is
    used to detect  multi-mapping reads.
  synonyms:
  - -M
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Assign fractional counts to features. This option must be used together
    with '-M' or '-O' or both. When '-M' is specified, each reported alignment from
    a multi-mapping read (identified via 'NH' tag) will carry a fractional count of
    1/x, instead of 1 (one), where x is the total number of alignments reported for
    the same read. When '-O' is specified, each overlapping feature will receive a
    fractional count of 1/y, where y is the total number of features overlapping with
    the read. When both '-M' and '-O' are specified, each alignment will carry a fractional
    count of 1/(x*y).

    bit 0x100 in SAM/BAM FLAG field.

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Ignore duplicate reads in read counting. Duplicate reads  are identified
    using bit Ox400 in BAM/SAM FLAG field. The  whole read pair is ignored if one
    of the reads is a  duplicate read for paired end data.
  synonyms:
  - --ignoreDup
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Perform strand-specific read counting. A single integer value (applied
    to all input files) or a string of comma- separated values (applied to each corresponding
    input file) should be provided. Possible values include: 0 (unstranded), 1 (stranded)
    and 2 (reversely stranded). Default value is 0 (ie. unstranded read counting carried
