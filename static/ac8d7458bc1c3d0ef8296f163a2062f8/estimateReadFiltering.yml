help_text: "usage: Example usage: estimateReadFiltering.py -b sample1.bam sample2.bam\
  \ > log.txt\n\nThis tool estimates the number of reads that would be filtered given\
  \ a set of\nsettings and prints this to the terminal. Further, it tracks the number\
  \ of singleton reads. The following metrics will always be tracked regardless of\
  \ what you specify (the order output also matches this):\n\n * Total reads (including\
  \ unmapped)\n * Mapped reads\n * Reads in blacklisted regions (--blackListFileName)\n\
  \nThe following metrics are estimated according to the --binSize and --distanceBetweenBins\
  \ parameters\n * Estimated mapped reads filtered (the total number of mapped reads\
  \ filtered for any reason)\n * Alignments with a below threshold MAPQ (--minMappingQuality)\n\
  \ * Alignments with at least one missing flag (--samFlagInclude)\n * Alignments\
  \ with undesirable flags (--samFlagExclude)\n * Duplicates determined by deepTools\
  \ (--ignoreDuplicates)\n * Duplicates marked externally (e.g., by picard)\n * Singletons\
  \ (paired-end reads with only one mate aligning)\n * Wrong strand (due to --filterRNAstrand)\n\
  \nThe sum of these may be more than the total number of reads. Note that alignments\
  \ are sampled from bins of size --binSize spaced --distanceBetweenBins apart.\n\n\

  \    If set, reads that have the same orientation and start\n                  \

  \ For example, to\n                        get only reads that are the first mate,\
  \ use a flag of\n                        64. This is useful to count properly paired\

  \ also\n                        considered for the coverage. (Default: None)\n \
  \ --samFlagExclude INT  Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to\n \
  \                       get only reads that map to the forward strand, use\n   \
  \                     --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for\n      \
  \                  reads that map to the reverse strand. (Default: None)\n  --blackListFileName\
  \ BED file [BED file ...], -bl BED file [BED file ...]\n                       \
  \ A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be\n                        excluded\
  \ from all analyses. Currently this works by\n                        rejecting\
  \ genomic chunks that happen to overlap an\n                        entry. Consequently,\
  \ for BAM files, if a read\n                        partially overlaps a blacklisted\
  \ region or a fragment\n                        spans over it, then the read/fragment\
  \ might still be\n                        considered. Please note that you should\
  \ adjust the\n                        effective genome size, if relevant.\n"
