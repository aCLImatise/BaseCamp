  \ a binary graph cut using Boykov's max-flow/min-cut algorithm.\n              \
  \    \n                  This implementation does not only compute a boundary term\
  \ but also a\n                  regional term which. The only available implementation\
  \ up till now is\n                  the use of an atalas (i.e. a probability image\
  \ of float values). The\n                  pixel values have to lie between 0 and\
  \ 1, whereas 1 denounces a sure\n                  probability that the object is\
  \ situated at this position.  The desired\n                  boundary term can be\
  \ selected via the --boundary argument. Depending on\n                  the selected\
  \ term, an additional image has to be supplied as badditional.\n               \
  \   \n                  In the case of the stawiaski boundary term, this is the\
  \ gradient image.\n                  In the case of the difference of means, it\
  \ is the original image.\n                  \n                  Furthermore the\
  \ algorithm requires the region map of the original\n                  image and\
  \ an integer image with foreground and background markers.\n                  \n\
  \                  Additionally a filename for the created binary mask marking foreground\n\
  \                  and background has to be supplied.\n                  \n    \
  \              Note that the input images must be of the same dimensionality,\n\
  \                  otherwise an exception is thrown.\n                  Note to\
  \ take into account the input images orientation.\n                  Note that the\
  \ quality of the resulting segmentations depends also on\n                  the\
  \ quality of the supplied markers.\n                  \n                  Copyright\
