- id: solid
  doc: ':           Minimum number of occurrences to consider a short read k-mer as
    solid, after correction (default: 1). This parameter should be carefully raised
    accordingly to the short reads coverage and accuracy, and to the chosen maximum
    order of the graph. It should only be increased when using high coverage of short
    reads, or a small maximum order.'

- id: branches
  doc: ':        Maximum number of branches exploration (default: 1,250). Raising
    this parameter will result in less split corrected long reads. However, it will
    also increase the runtime, and may create chimeric linkings between the seeds.'

- id: best_n
  doc: ':           Top alignments to be reported by BLASR (default: 50). This parameter
    should be raised accordingly to the short reads coverage. Its default value is
    adapted for a 50x coverage of short reads. It should be decreased with higher
    coverage, and increased with lower coverage.'
