help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 5, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Summarizes coverage information from basecov files\n              created by\
  \ pileup.sh.  They should be named like\n              'sample1_basecov.txt' but\
  \ other naming styles are fine too.\n\nUsage:        summarizecoverage.sh *basecov.txt\
  \ out=<output file>\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>           'in=' is not necessary.\
  \  Any filename used as a\n                    parameter will be assumed to be an\
  \ input basecov file.\nout=<file>          Write the summary here.  Default is stdout.\n\
  reflen=-1           If positive, use this as the total reference length.\n     \
  \               Otherwise, assume basecov files report every ref base.\n\nPlease\
  \ contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
