  \ GO:0008021 ontology/gene_ontology.obo\n\n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    traverses\
  \ DAG showing all paths (terms and intervening relationships) to\n    the root\n\
  \n    This script is purely file based; it needs to parse the ontology each time\n\
  \n    Subsequent parses can be speeded up using the use_cache option\n\n    If you\
  \ wish to use the GO MySQL db, see the script\n    go-db-show-paths-to-root.pl in\
  \ the go-db-perl distribution\n\n\e[1mARGUMENTS\e[0m\n   -e ERRFILE\n    writes\
  \ parse errors in XML - defaults to STDERR (there should be no parse\n    errors\
  \ in well formed files)\n\n   -p FORMAT\n    determines which parser to use; if\
  \ left unspecified, will make a guess\n    based on file suffix. See below for formats\n\
  \n  \e[1m-use_cache\e[0m\n    If this switch is specified, then caching mode is\
  \ turned on.\n\n    With caching mode, the first time you parse a file, then an\
  \ additional\n    file will be exported in a special format that is fast to parse.\
  \ This file\n    will have the same filename as the original file, except it will\
  \ have the\n    \".cache\" suffix.\n\n    The next time you parse the file, this\
  \ program will automatically check\n    for the existence of the \".cache\" file.\
  \ If it exists, and is more recent\n    than the file you specified, this is parsed\
  \ instead. If it does not exist,\n    it is rebuilt.\n\n  \e[1mDOCUMENTATION\e[0m\n\
