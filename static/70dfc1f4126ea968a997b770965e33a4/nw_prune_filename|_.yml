help_text: "Removes nodes by label\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\nnw_prune [-f:hv] <newick\
  \ trees filename|-> <label> [label+]\n\nInput\n-----\n\nArgument is the name of\
  \ a file that contains Newick trees, or '-' (in which\ncase trees are read from\
  \ standard input).\n\nOutput\n------\n\nRemoves all nodes whose labels are passed\
  \ on the command line, and prints\nout the modified tree. If removing a node causes\
  \ its parent to have only\none child (as is always the case in strictly binary trees),\
  \ the parent is\nspliced out and the remaining child is attached to its grandparent,\n\
  preserving length.\n\nOnly labeled nodes are considered for pruning.\n\nOptions\n\
  -------\n\n    -f: node labels are in a file whose name is the second argument,\n\
  \        instead of being passed  on the command line.\n        There should be\
  \ one label per line, and no leading or trailing\n        whitespace.\n    -h: print\
  \ this message and exit\n    -v: reverse: prune nodes whose labels are NOT passed\
  \ on the command\n        line. Inner nodes are not pruned. This allows pruning\
  \ of trees\n        with support values, which syntactically are node labels, withouti\n\
  \        inner nodes disappearing because their 'label' was not passed on\n    \
  \    the command line.\n\nAssumptions and Limitations\n---------------------------\n\
  \nLabels are assumed to be unique. \n\nExamples\n--------\n\n# Remove humans and\
  \ gorilla\n$ nw_prune data/catarrhini Homo Gorilla\n\n# Remove humans, chimp, and\
  \ gorilla\n$ nw_prune data/catarrhini Homo Gorilla Pan\n\n# the same, but using\
  \ the clade's label\n$ nw_prune data/catarrhini Homininae\n\n# keep great apes and\
  \ Colobines:\n$ nw_prune -v data/catarrhini Gorilla Pan Homo Pongo Simias Colobus\n\
  \n# same, using clade labels:\n$ nw_prune -v data/catarrhini Hominidae Colobinae\n"
