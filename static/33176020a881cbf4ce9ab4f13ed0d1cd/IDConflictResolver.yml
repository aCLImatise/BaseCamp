  description: "A map may contain multiple features with both identical (possibly\
    \ modified i.e. not stripped) sequence and charge state. The feature with the\
    \ 'highest  intensity' is very likely the most reliable one. When switched on,\
    \ the filter removes the sequence annotation from the lower intensity features,\
    \ thereby resolving the multiplicity. Only the most reliable features for each\
    \ (possibly modified i.e. not stripped) sequence maintain annotated with this\
    \ peptide sequence. (default: 'off' valid: 'off', 'highest_intensity')"
