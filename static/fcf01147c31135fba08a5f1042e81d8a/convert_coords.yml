  description: Index of frame of reference for feature coordinates, as  defined in
    the GFF file.  Use an integer 1-N (if N seqs)  or 0 to indicate the coordinate
    system of the alignment  as a whole.  Default behavior is to match features with  alignment
    sequences by name (feature by feature).

  \nDESCRIPTION:\nConverts coordinates of features in a GFF file according to a multiple\n\
  alignment.  Will map from the coordinate system of any sequence to any\nother sequence;\
  \ can also map to or from the coordinate system of the\nentire alignment.  In addition,\
  \ supports translation of coordinates by\nspecified offset.\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -m\
  \ <msa_fname>  (required) Name of file in which alignment is defined.\n    -f <gff_fname>\
  \  (required) Name of file in which features are defined (GFF). \n    -s <src_frame>\
  \  Index of frame of reference for feature coordinates, as \n                  \
  \  defined in the GFF file.  Use an integer 1-N (if N seqs) \n                 \
  \   or 0 to indicate the coordinate system of the alignment \n                 \

  \    -p <coord_off>  Positive coordinate offset.  This value will be\n         \
