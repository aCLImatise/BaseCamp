help_text: "\nUnrecognized flag: --help\n\nThis program outputs the overlaps file\
  \ as well as (optionally) the coords file for a given set of\n k-unitigs generated\
  \ by k-mers of length K that overlap by exactly\n (K-1) bases. We work, by default,\
  \ with k-unitigs generated using a\n k-mer size of 31, but if another k-mer size\
  \ was used, use the flag\n-kmervalue kMerSize\n to specify the k-mer size used when\
  \ generating the k-unitigs.\n\nThe first non-flag arg is the prefix used for the\
  \ k-unitigs files.\n It assumes that the files are named *_#.fa, where\n * is the\
  \ prefix specified and the #s start from 0 and continue until\n the last one. This\
  \ arg may also be used to specify the complete\n filename. Note that all input files\
  \ are assumed to have k-unitig\n numbers in ascending order.\n\nThe second non-flag\
  \ arg is the prefix used for the output files.\n The program will generate the files\n\
  \ prefix.coords   and   prefix.overlaps.\n\n So the final syntax is\n\ncreateKUnitigMaxOverlaps\
  \ [flags] inputPrefix outputPrefix\n where the possible flags are\n   -h: help and\
  \ exit\n   -kmervalue kMerSize\n   -create-coords-file to output the coords file\
  \ as well as the overlaps file\n   -largest-kunitig-number largestKUnitigNumber\
  \ (in this case the\n       k-unitigs don't have to be in numeric order in the files.)\n"
