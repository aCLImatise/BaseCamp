  \ Regions Analysis using Monte Carlo. Ologram annotates peaks (in bed\n     format)\
  \ using (i) genomic features extracted from a GTF file (e.g promoter, tts, gene\
  \ body,\n     UTR...) (ii) genomic regions tagged with particular keys/values in\
  \ a GTF file (e.g.\n     gene_biotype \"protein_coding\", gene_biotype \"LncRNA\"\
  ...) or (iii) from a BED file (e.g. user-\n     defined regions).  Each pair {peak\
  \ file, feature} is randomly shuffled independently across the\n     genome (inter-region\
  \ lengths are considered). Then the probability of intersection under the\n    \
  \ null hypothesis (the peaks and this feature are independent) is deduced thanks\
  \ to this Monte\n     Carlo approach. The program will return statistics for both\
  \ the number of intersections and the\n     total lengths (in basepairs) of all\
  \ intersections.  The null hypothesis is:  H0: The regions of\n     the query (--peak-file)\
  \ are located independently of the  reference (--inputfile or --more-bed)\n    \
  \ with respect to overlap.  H1: The regions of the query (--peak-file) tend to overlap\
  \ the\n     reference (--inputfile or --more-bed).   OLOGRAM can now also calculate\
  \ enrichment for n-wise\n     combinations (e.g. [Query + A + B] or [Query + B +\
  \ C]) on sets of regions defined by the user\n     (--more-bed argument).  Author\
  \ : Quentin FERRE <quentin.q.ferre@gmail.com>, Co-authors :\n     Guillaume CHARBONNIER\
  \ <guillaume.charbonnier@outlook.com> and Denis PUTHIER\n     <denis.puthier@univ-amu.fr>.\n\
  \n  Notes:\n     *  OLOGRAM is multithreaded and can use many cores, most notably\
  \ processing one batch of\n     shuffles per core. Note that this can be RAM-intensive,\
  \ on top of the base pygtftk processing\n     of a full human GTF can require upwards\
  \ of 8Gb. It is recommended you do not run other programs\n     in the meantime\
  \ on a laptop.\n     *  You may pass custom sets of regions as BED files, especially\
  \ for multiple overlaps,  with\n     the\n     *  more-bed arguments to look for\
  \ enrichment in overlaps for custom annotations.\n     *  Genome size is computed\
  \ from the provided chromInfo file (-c). It should thus only contain\n     ordinary\
  \ chromosomes. --chrom-info may also accept 'mm8', 'mm9', 'mm10', 'hg19', 'hg38',\
  \ 'rn3'\n     or 'rn4'. In this case the corresponding size of conventional chromosomes\
  \ are used. ChrM is not\n     used.\n     *  The program produces a pdf file and\
  \ a tsv file ('_stats_') containing intersection\n     statistics for the shuffled\
  \ BEDs under H0 (peak_file and the considered genomic region are\n     independant):\
  \ number of intersections (N = number of lines in the bed intersect) and total\n\
  \     number of overlapping base pairs (S).  The output figure gives, for both statistics,\n\
  \     expectation and standard deviation (error bars) in the shuffles compared to\
  \ the actual values.\n     It also gives, under the 'fit' label for each statistic,\
  \ the goodness of fit of the statistic\n     under (H0) to a Negative Binomial assessed\
  \ by a Cramer's V score (fit_quality gives 1-V ; as\n     per Cramer (1948) a good\
  \ fit should have a fit quality above (1 - 0.25 = 0.75) if your nb. of\n     shuffles\
  \ is in the hundreds, but closer to 0.9 if it is in the thousands or above.  The\
  \ p-value\n     of the true intersection under the distribution characterized by\
  \ the shuffles is also given,\n     under 'p_value'. Finally, the log2 fold change\
  \ between true and shuffles is also given.\n     *  If --more-keys is used additional\
  \ region sets will be tested based on the associated key\n     value. As an example,\
  \ if --more-keys is set to the 'gene_biotype' (a key generally found in\n     ensembl\
  \ GTF), the region related to 'protein_coding', 'lncRNA' or any other values for\
  \ that key\n     will be retrieved merged and tested for enrichment.\n     *  Use\
  \ --no-basic-feature if you want to perform enrichment analysis on custom, focused\n\
  \     annotations only (--more-bed or --more-key).\n     *  The goal of the minibatches\
  \ is to save RAM. You should increase the number of minibatches,\n     instead of\
  \ their size. You may need to use very small minibatches if you have large sets\
  \ of\n     regions.\n     *  You can exclude regions from the shuffling. This is\
  \ done by shuffling across a concatenated\n     \"sub-genome\" obtained by removing\
  \ the excluded regions, but the same ones will be excluded from\n     the peak_file\
  \ and the GTF/more-bed files.\n     *  BETA : About --use-markov. This arguments\
  \ control whether to use Markov model realisations\n     (of order 2) instead of\
  \ independant shuffles for respectively region lengths and inter-region\n     lengths.\
  \ This can better capture the structure of the genomic regions repartitions. This\
  \ is not\n     recommended in the general case and can be *very* time-consuming\
  \ (hours).\n     *  While they will be accepted by OLOGRAM, in BED files lines such\
  \ as \"chr1 100 100\" or \"chr1\n     100\" would represent empty regions (of length\
  \ 0) and as such are an error.\n     *  Support for multiple overlaps is available.\
  \ Please see the documentation for more\n     information. If the --more-bed-multiple-overlap\
  \ argument is used, the query peak file will be\n     compared with the custom regions\
  \ passed to the --more-bed argument, and with  them only. For\n     example, you\
  \ can put as query the  binding sites of the Transcription Factor A, in --more-bed\n\
  \     the factors B, C and D, and see whether A+B+D is an enriched combination.\n\
  \     *  By default, interesections are counted as \"inexact\", meaning an overlap\
  \ of [A + B + C] will\n     count towards [A + B + ...]. For exact intersections\
  \ (ie. [A + B + nothing else]), set the\n     --multiple-overlap-target-combi-size\
  \ flag to the number of --more-bed +1 (+1 for the query)\n     In any case, only\
  \ intersections with the query are counted. ie. Query+A+B is counted, but A+B+C\n\
  \     is not. Intersection within sets are supported by the backend and may come\
  \ in a future version.\n     We recommend using --multiple-overlap-target-combi-size\
  \ only when not using MODL since\n     filtering is applied after the first step\
  \ of candidate mining.\n     *  Furthermore, you may use our MODL algorithm to find\
  \ biological complexes of interest, by\n     mining for frequent itemsets on the\
  \ intersections on the true data. This is done with the\n     --multiple-overlap-max-number-of-combinations\
  \ argument. This will not change the N,S and\n     enrichment result, but will restrict\
  \ the set of interesting combis for which those are\n     calculated and displayed\n\
  \     *  MODL is designed to find complexes more than association rules, so we do\
  \ not recommend\n     asking for more than 20-50 combinations to keep the running\
  \ time reasonable and keep the found\n     combinations still relevant. Note that\
  \ MODL is completely optional. It is mostly needed when\n     the list of --more-bed\
  \ is very long and you do not want to filter the results manually, and\n     when\
  \ you are working with noisy data which could obfuscate the interesting combinations.\
  \ MODL\n     employs a form of subsampling on the original matrix and will discard\
  \ combinations rarer than\n     1/10000 occurences to reduce computing times. This\
  \ can magnify the noise however and can be\n     disabled when using MODL separately.\
  \   It will also reduce the abundance of all lines in the\n     matrix to their\
  \ square roots to reduce the emphasis on the most frequent elements. This is done\n\
  \     as the matrix of intersections will usually have many redundant lines and\
  \ as such can be\n     squished without changing the result. It is also possible\
  \ to bypass it and provide a custom\n     list of combinations to be considered.\n\
  \     *  MODL can be used separately in Python. An example of how to compute an\
  \ intersection matrix\n     manually from BED files is presented in the documentation.\n\
  \     *  For statistical reality reasons, with multiple sets the expected overlaps\
  \ for the longer\n     combinations (A+B+C+D+... when they are all independant)\
  \ can be very low. As a result, longer\n     combinations tend to be more enriched\
  \ : this should be kept in mind when comparing enrichment\n     values.  This is\
  \ especially true for small regions such as Transcriptional Regulator biding\n \
  \    sites where the total coverage of all sets considered is low.  Note that the\
  \ fact that we are\n     using a Negative Binomial rather than empirical p-values\
  \ helps alleviate this problem. If a\n     combination is so rare that it is not\
  \ encoutered even once in the shuffles, it will have a\n     p-value of NaN. Furthermore,\
  \ if C is depleted with query but always present with A and B, and A\n     and B\
  \ are enriched themselves, A+B+C will be enriched.\n     *  A low number of intersecting\
  \ basepairs can require using more shuffles, but very-low-average\n     Negative\
  \ Binomial distributions are not really signficant. We recommend instead shuffling\
  \ only\n     across a biologically relevant subsection of the genome (with --bed-incl)\
  \ : for example, if\n     studying  Transcriptional Regulators, shuffling only on\
  \ inferred Cis Regulatory Modules or\n     promoters. Or perhaps run a first pairwise\
  \  analysis to identify likely candidates, and then\n     shuffle only across a\
  \ subgenome obtained by merging all regions in the query. This also allows\n   \
  \  using fewer shuffles (dozens), because remembering intersections across many\
  \ files will use\n     RAM.  If you nevertheless need to use many shuffles, look\
  \ to the ologram_merge_run plugin.\n     *  We recommend running the ologram_modl_treeify\
  \ plugin on the resulting tsv file if you use\n     multiple overlaps.\n     * \
  \ If you manually specify the combinations to be studied with --multiple-overlap-custom-\n\
  \     combis, use the following format for the text file :  The order is the same\
  \ as --more-beds\n     (ie. if --more-bed is \"A.bed B.bed C.bed\", \"1 0 1 1\"\
  \ means Query + B + C). Data should be\n     whitespace separated with one combination\
  \ per line.\n\n  Version:  2020-08-01\n\nArguments:\n -i, --inputfile          \
