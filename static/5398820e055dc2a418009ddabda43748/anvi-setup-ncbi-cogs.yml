  description: The directory for COG data to be stored. If you leave it as is without
    specifying anything, the default destination for the data directory will be used
    to set things up. The advantage of it is that everyone will be using a single
    data directory, but then you may need superuser privileges to do it. Using this
    parameter you can choose the location of the data directory somewhere you like.
    However, when it is time to run COGs, you will need to remember that path and
    provide it to the program.

  description: Remove all the previously stored files and start over. If something
    is feels wrong for some reason and if you believe re-downloading files and setting
    them up could address the issue, this is the flag that will tell anvi'o to act
    like a real computer scientist challenged with a computational problem.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.
