help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified February 17, 2015\n\nDescription:\
  \  Generates fake read pairs from ends of contigs or single reads.\n\nUsage:   \
  \     bbfakereads.sh in=<file> out=<outfile> out2=<outfile2>\n\nOut2 is optional;\
  \ if there is only one output file, it will be written interleaved.\n\nStandard\
  \ parameters:\now=f                (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.\n\
  zl=4                (ziplevel) Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).\nfastawrap=100\
  \       Length of lines in fasta output.\ntuc=f               (touppercase) Change\
  \ lowercase letters in reads to uppercase.\nqin=auto            ASCII offset for\
  \ input quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto.\nqout=auto       \
  \    ASCII offset for output quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto\
  \ (same as input).\nqfin=<.qual file>   Read qualities from this qual file, for\
  \ the reads coming from 'in=<fasta file>'\nqfout=<.qual file>  Write qualities from\
  \ this qual file, for the reads going to 'out=<fasta file>'\nqfout2=<.qual file>\
  \ Write qualities from this qual file, for the reads coming from 'out2=<fasta file>'\n\
  verifyinterleaved=f (vint) When true, checks a file to see if the names look paired.\
  \  Prints an error message if not.\ntossbrokenreads=f   (tbr) Discard reads that\
  \ have different numbers of bases and qualities.  By default this will be detected\
  \ and cause a crash.\n\nFaking parameters:\nlength=250          Generate reads of\
  \ this length.\nminlength=1         Don't generate reads shorter than this.\noverlap=0\
  \           If you set overlap, then reads will by variable length, overlapping\
  \ by 'overlap' in the middle.\nidentifier=null     (id) Output read names are prefixed\
  \ with this.\naddspace=t          Set to false to omit the  space before /1 and\
  \ /2 of paired reads.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx                This will set Java's\
  \ memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                    -Xmx20g will specify\
  \ 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n                    The max\
  \ is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom               This flag will cause\
  \ the process to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory exception occurs.\
  \  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact\
  \ Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
