  description: "[<extension>] edits the file(s) in place, if an extension is provided\
    \ (no space between \"-i\" and the extension) then the original file is backed-up\
    \ with that extension The rules for the extension are the same as Perl's (see\
    \ perldoc perlrun): if the extension includes no \"*\" then it is appended to\
    \ the original file name, If the extension does contain one or more \"*\" characters,\
    \ then each \"*\" is replaced with the current filename."

  description: use XML::Twig output_encoding (based on Text::Iconv or Unicode::Map8
    and Unicode::String) to set the output encoding. By default the original encoding
    is preserved. If this option is used the XML declaration is updated (and created
    if there was none). Make sure that the encoding is supported by the parser you
    use if you want to be able to process the pretty_printed file (XML::Parser does
    not support 'latin1' for example, you have to use 'iso-8859-1')
