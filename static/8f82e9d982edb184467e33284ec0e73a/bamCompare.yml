  \         chromosomes, like male samples. An usage examples is\n               \
  \         --ignoreForNormalization chrX chrM. (default: None)\n  --skipNonCoveredRegions,\
  \ --skipNAs\n                        This parameter determines if non-covered regions\n\
  \                        (regions without overlapping reads) in a BAM file\n   \
  \                     should be skipped. The default is to treat those\n       \
  \                 regions as having a value of zero. The decision to\n         \
  \               skip non-covered regions depends on the interpretation\n       \
  \                 of the data. Non-covered regions may represent, for\n        \
  \                example, repetitive regions that should be skipped.\n         \
  \               (default: False)\n  --smoothLength INT bp\n                    \
  \    The smooth length defines a window, larger than the\n                     \
  \   binSize, to average the number of reads. For example,\n                    \
  \    if the --binSize is set to 20 and the --smoothLength\n                    \
  \    is set to 60, then, for each bin, the average of the\n                    \
  \    bin and its left and right neighbors is considered.\n                     \
  \   Any value smaller than --binSize will be ignored and\n                     \
  \   no smoothing will be applied. (default: None)\n\nRead processing options:\n\
  \  --extendReads [INT bp], -e [INT bp]\n                        This parameter allows\
  \ the extension of reads to\n                        fragment size. If set, each\
  \ read is extended, without\n                        exception. *NOTE*: This feature\
  \ is generally NOT\n                        recommended for spliced-read data, such\
  \ as RNA-seq, as\n                        it would extend reads over skipped regions.\
  \ *Single-\n                        end*: Requires a user specified value for the\
  \ final\n                        fragment length. Reads that already exceed this\n\
  \                        fragment length will not be extended. *Paired-end*:\n \
  \                       Reads with mates are always extended to match the\n    \
  \                    fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated\n    \
  \                    reads, mate reads that map too far apart (>4x fragment\n  \
  \                      length) or even map to different chromosomes are\n      \
  \                  treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment\n    \
  \                    length value is optional. If no value is specified, it\n  \
  \                      is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment size\n \
  \                       of all mate reads). (default: False)\n  --ignoreDuplicates\
  \    If set, reads that have the same orientation and start\n                  \
  \      position will be considered only once. If reads are\n                   \
  \     paired, the mate's position also has to coincide to\n                    \
  \    ignore a read. (default: False)\n  --minMappingQuality INT\n              \
  \          If set, only reads that have a mapping quality score\n              \
  \          of at least this are considered. (default: None)\n  --centerReads   \
  \      By adding this option, reads are centered with respect\n                \
  \        to the fragment length. For paired-end data, the read\n               \
  \         is centered at the fragment length defined by the two\n              \
  \          ends of the fragment. For single-end data, the given\n              \
  \          fragment length is used. This option is useful to get\n             \
  \           a sharper signal around enriched regions. (default:\n              \
  \          False)\n  --samFlagInclude INT  Include reads based on the SAM flag.\
  \ For example, to\n                        get only reads that are the first mate,\
  \ use a flag of\n                        64. This is useful to count properly paired\
  \ reads only\n                        once, as otherwise the second mate will be\
  \ also\n                        considered for the coverage. (Default: None)\n \
  \ --samFlagExclude INT  Exclude reads based on the SAM flag. For example, to\n \
  \                       get only reads that map to the forward strand, use\n   \
  \                     --samFlagExclude 16, where 16 is the SAM flag for\n      \
  \                  reads that map to the reverse strand. (Default: None)\n  --minFragmentLength\
  \ INT\n                        The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair\n\
  \                        inclusion. This option is primarily useful in ATACseq\n\
  \                        experiments, for filtering mono- or di-nucleosome\n   \
  \                     fragments. (Default: 0)\n  --maxFragmentLength INT\n     \
  \                   The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair\n         \
  \               inclusion. (Default: 0)\n"
