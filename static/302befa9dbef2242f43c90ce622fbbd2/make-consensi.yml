  description: Output in FASTQ instead of FASTA. You must specify the quality score
    to give to all bases. There is no meaningful quality score we can automatically
    give, so you will have to specify an artificial one. A good choice is 40, the
    maximum score normally output by sequencers.

  description: Report helpful usage data to the developer, to better understand the
    use cases and performance of the tool. The only data which will be recorded is
    the name and version of the tool, the size of the input data, the time and memory
    taken to process it, and the IP address of the machine running it. Also, if the
    script fails, it will report the name of the exception thrown and the line of
    code it occurred in. No filenames are sent, and the only parameters reported are
    the number of --processes and the --queue-size. All the reporting and recording
    code is available at https://github.com/NickSto/ET.
