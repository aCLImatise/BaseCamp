  \ input_file_reads\n\nThis script takes as input a file with deep sequencing reads\
  \ (these can be in\ndifferent formats, see the options below). The script then processes\
  \ the reads\nand/or maps them to the reference genome, as designated by the options\
  \ given.\nOptions:\n\nRead input file:\n-a              input file is seq.txt format\n\
  -b              input file is qseq.txt format\n-c              input file is fasta\
  \ format\n-e              input file is fastq format\n-d              input file\
  \ is a config file (see miRDeep2 documentation).\n                options -a, -b,\
  \ -c or -e must be given with option -d.\n\nPreprocessing/mapping:\n-g         \
  \     three-letter prefix for reads (by default 'seq')\n-h              parse to\
  \ fasta format\n-i              convert rna to dna alphabet (to map against genome)\n\
  -j              remove all entries that have a sequence that contains letters\n\
  \                other than a,c,g,t,u,n,A,C,G,T,U,N\n-k seq          clip 3' adapter\
  \ sequence\n-l int          discard reads shorter than int nts, default = 18\n-m\
  \              collapse reads\n\n-p genome       map to genome (must be indexed\
  \ by bowtie-build). The 'genome'\n                string must be the prefix of the\
  \ bowtie index. For instance, if\n                the first indexed file is called\
  \ 'h_sapiens_37_asm.1.ebwt' then\n                the prefix is 'h_sapiens_37_asm'.\n\
  -q              map with one mismatch in the seed (mapping takes longer)\n\n-r int\
  \          a read is allowed to map up to this number of positions in the genome\n\
  \                default is 5\n\nOutput files:\n-s file         print processed\
  \ reads to this file\n-t file         print read mappings to this file\n\nOther:\n\
  -u              do not remove directory with temporary files\n-v              outputs\
  \ progress report\n\n-n              overwrite existing files\n\n-o            \
  \  number of threads to use for bowtie\n\nExample of use:\n\n/tmp/tmpepiu8i18/bin/mapper.pl\
  \ reads_seq.txt -a -h -i -j -k TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTGT  -l 18 -m -p h_sapiens_37_asm\
