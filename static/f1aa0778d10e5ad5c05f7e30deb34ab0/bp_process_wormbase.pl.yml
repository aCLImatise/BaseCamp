help_text: "This script massages the Wormbase GFF files located at\nftp://www.wormbase.org/pub/wormbase/GENE_DUMPS\
  \ into a version of the\nGFF format suitable for display by the generic genome browser.\
  \  It\nmainly adds comments to the annotations and designates certain\nwell-spaced\
  \ genetic loci as framework landmarks.\n\nThis script requires the AcePerl distribution,\
  \ which is available on\nCPAN (look for the \"Ace\" module).\n\nTo use this script,\
  \ get the WormBase GFF files from the FTP site\nlisted above and place them in a\
  \ directory.  It might be a good idea\nto name the directory after the current release,\
  \ such as WS61.  You do\nnot need to uncompress the files.\n\nThen give that directory\
  \ as the argument to this script and capture\nthe script's output to a file:\n\n\
  \  % process_wormbase.pl ./WS61 > wormbase.gff\n\nIt may take a while before you\
  \ see output from this script, since it\nmust first fetch gene and protein database\
  \ from the remote AceDB\nrunning at www.wormbase.org.\nThe wormbase.gff file can\
  \ then be loaded into a Bio::DB::GFF database\nusing the following command:\n\n\
  \  % bulk_load_gff.pl -d <databasename> wormbase.gff\n"
