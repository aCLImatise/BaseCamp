help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 4, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Fuses sequences together, padding gaps with Ns.\n\nUsage:   fuse.sh in=<input\
  \ file> out=<output file> pad=<number of Ns>\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>       The\
  \ 'in=' flag is needed if the input file is not the \n                first parameter.\
  \  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.\nout=<file>      The 'out=' flag is needed\
  \ if the output file is not the \n                second parameter.  'out=stdout'\
  \ will pipe to standard out.\npad=300         Pad this many N between sequences.\n\
  maxlen=2g       If positive, don't make fused sequences longer than this.\nquality=30\
  \      Fake quality scores, if generating fastq from fasta.\noverwrite=t     (ow)\
  \ Set to false to force the program to abort rather \n                than overwrite\
  \ an existing file.\nziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change\
  \ \n                compression level; lower compression is faster.\nfusepairs=f\
  \     Default mode fuses all sequences into one long sequence.\n               \
  \ Setting fusepairs=t will instead fuse each pair together.\nname=           Set\
  \ name of output sequence.  Default is the name of\n                the first input\
  \ sequence.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage,\
  \ overriding\n                autodetection.  -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM,\
  \ and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85%\
  \ of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause the process to exit\
  \ if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n\
  -da             Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
