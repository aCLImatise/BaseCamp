  \ '-'\nUnrecognized option --\n.USAGE.\n  hash-overlap  <input-name>\n\n.DESCRIPTION.\n\
  \  Compute pairwise overlaps among a set of sequences by\n  brute-force all-pairs\
  \ alignment. Sequences are obtained\n  from <input-name>, which by default is an\
  \ AMOS read bank.\n  Each line of the output file describes the overlap\n  between\
  \ two sequences. The lines are space-delimited and\n  contain 10 fields:\n    *\
  \ ID of first read (IIDs in the case of a read bank \n       input and sequence\
  \ index for a fasta file input)\n    * ID of second read\n    * overlap type: [N]ormal\
  \ (EB), [A]ntinormal (BE),\n       [I]nnie (EE) or [O]utie (BB), where B is the\
  \ \n       beginning of the read and E its end\n    * length of non-overlapping\
  \ portion for first read\n    * length of non-overlapping portion for second read\n\
  \    * overlap length for first read\n    * overlap length for second read\n   \
  \ * overlap score\n    * number of errors in the overlap\n    * overlap error percentage\n\
  \n.OPTIONS.\n  -A        Output AMOS-format messages instead of default\n  -B  \
  \      Output to AMOS bank instead of default\n  -b <n>    Use <n> as lowest read\

  \ exclusive)\n  -F        Input is from multi-fasta file <input-name>\n  -h    \

  \ -v <n>    Set verbose level to <n>. Higher produces more output.\n  -x <d>   \
  \ Set maximum error rate to <d>.  E.g., 0.06 is 6% error\n  -s        Be strand-specific:\
