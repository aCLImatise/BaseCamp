  description: Model indels for specified categories.  To have nonzero probability
    for the states corresponding to a specified category range, indels must be "clean"
    (nonoverlapping), must be assignable by parsimony to a single branch in the phylogenetic
    tree, and must have lengths that are exact multiples of the category range size.  Avoid
    -G with this option.  If used in training mode, requires -T.
