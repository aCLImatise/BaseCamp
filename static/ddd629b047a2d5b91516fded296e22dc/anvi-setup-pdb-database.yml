  description: The path for the PDB database to be stored. If you leave it as is without
    specifying anything, anvi'o will set up everything in a pre-defined default directory.
    The advantage of using the default directory at the time of set up is that every
    user of anvi'o on a computer system will be using a single data directory, but
    then you may need to run the setup program with superuser privileges. If you don't
    have superuser privileges, then you can use this parameter to tell anvi'o the
    location you wish to use to setup your database.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: By default, MODELLER's search DB is updated when this program is ran
    so that if MODELLER finds a protein, its structure is guaranteed to be in this
    database. If you don't want to touch the MODELLER database, use this flag.

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Remove all the previously stored files and start over. If something
    is feels wrong for some reason and if you believe re-downloading files and setting
    them up could address the issue, this is the flag that will tell anvi'o to act
    like a real computer scientist challenged with a computational problem.
