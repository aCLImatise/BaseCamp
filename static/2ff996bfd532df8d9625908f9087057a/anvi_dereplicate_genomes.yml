  \                     https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani, the method\n       \
  \                 'ANIm' uses MUMmer (NUCmer) to align the input\n             \
  \           sequences. 'ANIb' uses BLASTN+ to align 1020nt\n                   \
  \     fragments of the input sequences. 'ANIblastall': uses\n                  \
  \      the legacy BLASTN to align 1020nt fragments Finally,\n                  \

  \    each input sequence\n  --min-alignment-fraction NUM\n                     \
  \   In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates\n                        (percent\
  \ identity scores) between two genomes that\n                        have little\
  \ to do with each other simply because only\n                        a small fraction\
  \ of their content may be aligned. This\n                        filter will set\
  \ all ANI scores between two genomes to\n                        0 if the alignment\
  \ fraction is less than you deem\n                        trustable. When you set\
  \ a value, anvi'o will go\n                        through the ANI results, and\
  \ set percent identity\n                        scores between two genomes to 0\
  \ if the alignment\n                        fraction *between either of them* is\
  \ less than the\n                        parameter described here. The default is\
  \ 0.25.\n  --significant-alignment-length INT\n                        So --min-alignment-fraction\
  \ discards any hit that is\n                        coming from alignments that\
  \ represent shorter\n                        fractions of genomes, but what if you\
  \ still don't want\n                        to miss an alignment that is longer\
  \ than an X number\n                        of nucleotides regardless of what fraction\
  \ of the\n                        genome it represents? Well, this parameter is\
  \ to\n                        recover things that may be lost due to --min-\n  \
  \                      alignment-fraction parameter. Let's say, if you set\n   \
  \                     --min-alignment-fraction to '0.05', and this parameter\n \
  \                       to '5000', anvi'o will keep hits from alignments that\n\
  \                        are longer than 5000 nts, EVEN IF THEY REPRESENT less\n\
  \                        than 5 percent of a given genome pair. Basically if\n \
  \                       --min-alignment-fraction is your shield to protect\n   \
  \                     yourself from incoming garbage, --significant-\n         \
  \               alignment-length is your chopstick to pick out those\n         \
  \               that may be interesting, and you are a true warrior\n          \
  \              here. (default: None)\n  --use-full-percent-identity\n          \
  \              Usually, percent identity is calculated only over\n             \
  \           aligned regions, and this is what is used as a\n                   \
  \     distance metric by default. But with this flag, you\n                    \
  \    can instead use the *full* percent identity as the\n                      \
  \  distance metric. It is the same as percent identity,\n                      \
  \  except that regions that did not align are included in\n                    \
  \    the calculation. This means *full* percent identity\n                     \
  \   will always be less than or equal to percent identity.\n                   \
  \     How is it calculated? Well if P is the percentage\n                      \
  \  identity calculated in aligned regions, L is the\n                        length\
  \ of the genome, and A is the fraction of the\n                        genome that\
  \ aligned to a compared genome, the full\n                        percent identity\
  \ is P * (A/L). In other words, it is\n                        the percent identity\
  \ multiplied by the alignment\n                        coverage. For example, if\
  \ the alignment is a whopping\n                        97 percent identity but only\
  \ 8 percent of the genome\n                        aligned, the *full* percent identity\
  \ is 0.970 * 0.080\n                        = 0.078, which is just 7.8 percent.\
  \ (default: False)\n  --min-full-percent-identity FULL_PERCENT_IDENTITY\n      \
  \                  In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates\n          \
  \              (percent identity scores) between two genomes that\n            \
  \            have little to do with each other simply because only\n           \
  \             a small fraction of their content may be aligned. This\n         \
  \               can be partly alleviated by considering the *full*\n           \
  \             percent identity, which includes in its calculation\n            \
  \            regions that did not align. For example, if the\n                 \
  \       alignment is a whopping 97 percent identity but only 8\n               \
  \         percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent\n                  \
  \      identity is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078 OR 7.8 percent.\n                     \
  \   *full* percent identity is always included in the\n                        report,\
  \ but you can also use it as a filter for other\n                        metrics,\
  \ such as percent identity. This filter will\n                        set all ANI\
  \ measures between two genomes to 0 if the\n                        *full* percent\
  \ identity is less than you deem\n                        trustable. When you set\
  \ a value, anvi'o will go\n                        through the ANI results, and\
  \ set all ANI measures\n                        between two genomes to 0 if the\
  \ *full* percent\n                        identity *between either of them* is less\
  \ than the\n                        parameter described here. The default is 20.\n\

  \                   cluster. Since measures of 'similarity' depend\n           \
  \             strongly on what method is used for calculation, and\n           \
  \             since the threshold at which two genomes should be\n             \
  \           considered 'similar enough' to be considered redundant\n           \
  \             will depend on the application, anvi'o refuses to\n              \
  \          provide a default parameter. If you're using pyANI,\n               \
  \         maybe 0.90 is what you're after. If you're using\n                   \
  \     sourmash, maybe 0.25 is what you're after. Or maybe\n                    \
  \    not? Anvi'o is feeling nervous about this decision.\n                     \

  \  Currently, genomes are clustered based on a simple\n                        greedy\

  \ If genome A is 0.95 similar to B, and B is\n                        0.95 similar\
  \ to C, and C is 0.95 similar to D, then\n                        {A,B,C,D} will\
  \ form a cluster. This is *even though* D\n                        may share a similarity\
