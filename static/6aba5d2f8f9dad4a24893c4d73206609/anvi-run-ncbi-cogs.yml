  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  description: DIAMOND sensitivity. With this flag you can instruct DIAMOND to be
    'sensitive', rather than 'fast' during the search. It is likely the search will
    take remarkably longer. But, hey, if you are doing it for your final analysis,
    maybe it should take longer and be more accurate. This flag is only relevant if
    you are running DIAMOND.
