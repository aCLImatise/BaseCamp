  \ FASTQ files and a short sequence, and it\nreturns all short reads from the FASTQ\
  \ file that matches to it. The purpose of\nthis is to get back short reads that\
  \ may be extending into hypervariable\nregions of genomes, resulting a decreased\
  \ mappability of short reads in the\nmetagenome given a reference. You often see\
  \ those areas of genomes as\nsignificant dips in coverage, and in most cases with\
  \ a large number of SNVs.\nWhen you provide the downstream conserved sequence, this\
  \ program allows you to\ntake a better look at those regions at the short read level\
  \ without any\nmapping.\n\npositional arguments:\n  FASTQ_FILES           One or\
