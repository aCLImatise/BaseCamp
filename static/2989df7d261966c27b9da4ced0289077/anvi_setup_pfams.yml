  description: The directory for Pfam data to be stored. If you leave it as is without
    specifying anything, the default destination for the data directory will be used
    to set things up. The advantage of it is that everyone will be using a single
    data directory, but then you may need superuser privileges to do it. Using this
    parameter you can choose the location of the data directory somewhere you like.
    However, when it is time to run Pfam, you will need to remember that path and
    provide it to the program.
