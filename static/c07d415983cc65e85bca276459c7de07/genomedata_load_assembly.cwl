- id: file_mode
  doc: If specified, the Genomedata archive will be implemented as a single file,
    with a separate h5 group for each Chromosome. This is recommended if there are
    a large number of Chromosomes. The default behavior is to use a single file if
    there are at least 100 Chromosomes being added.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --file-mode
- id: directory_mode
  doc: If specified, the Genomedata archive will be implemented as a directory, with
    a separate file for each Chromosome. This is recommended if there are a small
    number of Chromosomes. The default behavior is to use a directory if there are
    fewer than 100 Chromosomes being added.
