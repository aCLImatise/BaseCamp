help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 22, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Provides some of Reformat's functionality in a ZMW-aware tool.\n\nUsage:  reformatpb.sh\
  \ in=<input file> out=<output file> outb=<bad reads>\n\nFile I/O parameters:\nin=<file>\
  \       Primary input.\nout=<file>      (outgood) Output for good reads.\noutb=<file>\
  \     (outbad) Output for discarded reads.\nstats=<file>    Print screen output\
  \ here instead of to the screen.\njson=f          Print stats as json.\nschist=<file>\
  \   Subread count per ZMW histogram.\noverwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force\
  \ the program to abort rather than\n                overwrite an existing file.\n\
  ziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression\n \
  \               level; lower compression is faster.\n\nProcessing parameters:\n\
  kzt=f           (keepzmwstogether) Send all reads from a ZMW to the same file,\n\
  \                either good or bad output.\nminlen=40       Do not output reads\
  \ shorter than this, after trimming.\nccs=f           Input reads are CCS, meaning\
  \ they are all full-pass.\n                Not currently used for anything.\ntrimpolya=f\
  \     Trim terminal poly-A and poly-T sequences, for some isoseq\n             \
  \   libraries.\nminpolymer=5    Don't trim poly-A sequence shorter than this.\n\
  polyerror=0.2   Max error rate for trimming poly-A.\nflag\n\nWhitelists and Blacklists:\n\
  whitelist=      ZMW identifiers, as a comma-delimited list of integers,\n      \
  \          or files with one integer per line.  All ZMWs not in the\n          \
  \      list will be discarded.\nblacklist=      All ZMWs in the list will be discarded.\n\
  \nSampling parameters (avoid using more than one of these at a time):\nreads=-1\
  \        If positive, quit after processing this many reads.\nzmws=-1         If\
  \ positive, quit after processing this many ZMWs.\nbestpass=f      Set to true to\
  \ keep only the best read per ZMW.  This is\n                the median length read\
  \ of the non-outermost reads.\n                If there are 2 or fewer passes, the\
  \ longest will be chosen.\nlongestpass=f   Set to true to keep only the longest\
  \ read per ZMW.\nsamplerate=1.0  Retain this fraction of input reads.\nsamplereadstarget=-1\
  \  If positive, retain this many reads.\nsamplebasestarget=-1  If positive, retain\
  \ this many bases.\nsamplezmwstarget=-1   If positive, retain this many ZMWs.\n\
  subsamplefromends=f   If true, eliminate outermost reads first, then inner.\nkeepzmwstogether=f\
  \    If true, all ZMW subreads are retained or discarded together.\n\nCCS Parameters\
  \ (Note: CCS is still experimental)\nccs=f           Make a single consensus read\
  \ per ZMW (CPU-intensive).\nminpasses=0     Discard ZMWs with fewer than this many\
  \ passes (estimated;\n                first and last subread are usually partial).\n\
  minsubreads=0   Discard ZMWs with fewer than this many subreads.\nreorient=f   \
  \   Try aligning both strands in case ZMW ordering is broken.\nminshredid=0.6  Do\
  \ not include shreds with identity below this in consensus.\n\nEntropy parameters\
  \ (recommended setting is 'entropy=t'):\nminentropy=-1   Set to 0.4 or above to\
  \ remove low-entropy reads;\n                range is 0-1, recommended value is\
  \ 0.55.  0.7 is too high.\n                Negative numbers disable this function.\n\
  entropyk=3      Kmer length for entropy calculation.\nentropylen=350  Reads with\
  \ entropy below cutoff for at least this many\n                consecutive bases\
  \ will be removed.\nentropyfraction=0.5     Alternative minimum length for short\
  \ reads; the shorter\n                        of entropylen and entfraction*readlength\
  \ will be used.\nentropywindow=50        Window size used for entropy calculation.\n\
  maxmonomerfraction=0.74 (mmf) Also require this fraction of bases in each\n    \
  \                    window to be the same base.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx     \
  \       This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n         \
  \       -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n               \
  \ specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom        \
  \   This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n             \
  \   exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
