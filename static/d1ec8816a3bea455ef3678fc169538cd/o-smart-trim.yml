  description: Even if there is only one read that is too short and therefore full
    of gap characters, the first location in the alignment file that *every* read
    has a base would have to match the length of that short read. With this percentage
    you can specify what is the percentage of reads you expect to pass while this
    trimming script tries to maximize the remaining read length after trimming. Default
    is 95.00
