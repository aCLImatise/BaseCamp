help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified March 28, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Finds and trims junctions in mapped Hi-C reads.\nFor the purpose of reporting\
  \ junction motifs, this requires paired-end reads,\nbecause only improper pairs\
  \ will be considered as possibly containing \njunctions.  However, all reads that\
  \ map with soft-clipping will be trimmed\non the 3' (right) end, regardless of pairing\
  \ status.\n\nUsage:  processhi-c.sh in=<mapped reads> out=<trimmed reads>\n\nParameters:\n\
  in=<file>       A sam/bam file containing mapped reads.\nout=<file>      Output\
  \ file of trimmed reads.\noverwrite=f     (ow) Set to false to force the program\
  \ to abort rather than\n                overwrite an existing file.\nprintkmers=t\
  \    Generate files with kmer counts at junction sites.\njunctions=junctions_k%.txt\
  \  File pattern for junction output.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will\
  \ set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will\
  \ specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs. The\
  \ max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause\
  \ the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires\
  \ Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
