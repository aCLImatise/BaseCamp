inputs:
- id: add_scores
  doc: if set, the similarity scores of each spectrum to the cluster's consensus spectrum
    isadded to the output file.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -add_scores

  doc: path to the directory to (temporarily) store the binary files. By default a
    temporary directory is being created

  doc: if this option is set the 'fast mode' is enabled. In this mode, the radical
    peak filtering used for the comparison function is already applied during spectrum

    decreased but speed increases 2-3 fold.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -fast_mode

  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -output_path

  doc: precursor tolerance (clustering window size) in m/z (default) or ppm used during
    matching. The unit can be changed by setting the -precursor_tolerance_unit parameter
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -precursor_tolerance
- id: precursor_tolerance_unit
  doc: sets the precursor tolerance unit. Allowed values are "mz" and "ppm". Default
    is "mz".

    prefix: -precursor_tolerance_unit
- id: remove_reporters
  doc: remove reporter ion peaks in quantitation experiments. Possible QUANTIATION
    TYPES are 'ITRAQ', 'TMT' and 'ALL' ('TMT' and 'ITRAQ' peaks are removed.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -remove_reporters
- id: reuse_binary_files
  doc: if this option is set, the binary files found in the binary file directory
    will be used for clustering.
  type: boolean

  doc: if set additional status information is printed.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -verbose
- id: x_convert_cgf
  doc: (Advanced option) It this option is set, the input file in CGF format will
    be converted to the .clustering file. No other processing will be performed.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -x_convert_cgf
- id: x_disable_mgf_comments
  doc: (Advanced option) If set, MGF comment strings are NOT supported. This will
    increase performance but only works for MGF files that do not contain any comments
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -x_disable_mgf_comments
- id: x_filter_peaks_mz
  doc: (Advanced option) If this option is set, the top 10 peaks per 100 m/z are retained
    instead of the top N peaks overall.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:

- id: x_learn_cdf
  doc: (Experimental option) Learn the used cumulative distribution function directly
    from the processed data. This is only recommended for high-resolution data. The

  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -x_learn_cdf

    the specified file. These files can be created using the x_learn_cdf parameter
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -x_load_cdf
- id: x_merge_binary_files
  doc: (Advanced option) If this option is set, the input files should be binary result
