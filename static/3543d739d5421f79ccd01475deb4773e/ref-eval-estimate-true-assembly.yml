  description: The prefix of the expression built by rsem-calculate-expression. Required.

    name: arg
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If you have paired-end data, and you want to estimate the "true" scaffolded
    assembly, then include the --paired-end flag. In this case, rsem-calculate-expression
    needs to have been run with the --paired-end flag. (However, even if rsem-calculate-expression
    was run with the --paired-end flag, you can omit it here in order to generate
    an unscaffolded assembly. In this case, each mate will be treated as an independent
    read.)

  description: A prefix to write the "true" assembly or sequence of assemblies to.
    The suffix _x.fa will be appended to this prefix, where x is the minimum overlap
    size. Required.

    name: arg
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Either: * An integer that specifies how much overlap between two reads
    is required to merge two reads. For example, if --min-overlap=3, then only reads
    whose chosen alignments overlap by at least 3 bases will be joined into contigs.
    If --min-overlap=0, then only reads whose chosen alignments are contiguous (or
    overlap by a positive amount) will be joined into contigs. Or: * A pair of integers,
    separated by commas, specifying a range of overlap sizes, as described above.
    For example, if --min-overlap=2,4 is given, then three assemblies will be produced,
    corresponding to --min-overlap=2, --min-overlap=3, and --min-overlap=4 You might
    use this option to compute ideal assemblies at all overlap sizes, e.g., --min-overlap=0,76
    for 76-length reads. Default: 0.'

    name: arg
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'A number between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Any alignment (of a read to
    a reference transcript) with posterior probability, as calculated by RSEM, strictly
    less than this value will be discarded. Noise reads, with posterior probability
    exactly 0, are always discarded. Default: 0.'

  - --min-alignment-prob
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: arg
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'The policy used to choose which alignment(s) of each read to use in
    constructing the "true" assembly. Options: * sample: For each read, sample a single
    alignment (to some reference transcript) according to the posterior probability
    that the read follows each alignment, as calculated by RSEM. * best: For each
    read, choose the alignment that maximizes the posterior probability mentioned
    above. Ties are broken arbitrarily but deterministically (the first alignment
    in the BAM file is used). * all: For each read, use all its alignments. Some reads
    might end up with more than one alignment. In that case, contigs will be made
    assuming that the read aligns to each place. (In other words, the read is effectively
    duplicated, with one copy per alignment.) This policy is applied after the thresholding
    implied by --min-alignment-prob. For example, if "--min-alignment-prob=0.10 --alignment-policy=sample"
    is given, then (first) all alignments with posterior probability less than 0.10
    will be discarded, and (second), for each read, an alignment will be sampled from
    among the remaining alignments, with the posterior distribution renormalized as
    appropriate. As another example, if "--min-alignment-prob=0.90 --alignment-policy=all"
    is given, then all alignments with posterior probability at least 0.90 will be
    used. Default: sample.'
