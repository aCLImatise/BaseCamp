    \ of their\ndisplay when necessary. The default value is (20000).\nIf you are\
    \ planning to use your contigs database for\nmetagenomic binning, we advise you\
    \ to not go below\n10,000 (since the lower the split size is, the more\nitems\
    \ to show in the display, and decreasing the split\nsize does not really help\
    \ much to binning). But if you\nare thinking about using this parameter for ad\
    \ hoc\ninvestigations other than binning, you should ignore\nour advice, and set\
    \ the split size as low as you want.\nIf you do not want your contigs to be split,\
    \ you can\nset the split size to '0' or any other negative\ninteger (lots of unnecessary\
