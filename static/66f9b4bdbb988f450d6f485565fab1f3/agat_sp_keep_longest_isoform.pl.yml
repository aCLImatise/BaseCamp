  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_keep_longest_isoform.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script aims\
  \ to filter isoforms when present. For a locus: - when all\n    isoforms have CDS\
  \ we keep the one with the longest CDS. - when some\n    isoforms have CDS some\
  \ others not, we keep the one with the longest CDS.\n    - when none of the isoforms\
  \ have CDS, we keep the one with the longest\n    concatenated exons.\n\nUsage:\n\
  \        agat_sp_keep_longest_isoform.pl -gff file.gff  [ -o outfile ]\n       \
  \ agat_sp_keep_longest_isoform.pl --help\n\nOptions:\n    --gff or -f\n        \
  \    GTF/GFF file.\n\n    --output or -o\n            File where will be written\
  \ the result. If no output file is\n            specified, the output will be written\
  \ to STDOUT.\n\n    -h or --help\n            Display this helpful text.\n\nFeedback:\n\
