  description: This filter will remove gene clusters from your report. Let's assume
    you have 100 genomes in your pan genome analysis. You can use this parameter if
    you want to work only with gene clusters that occur in at least X number of genomes.
    If you say '--min-num- genomes-gene-cluster-occurs 90', each gene cluster in the
    analysis will be required at least to appear in 90 genomes. If a gene occurs in
    less than that number of genomes, it simply will not be reported. This is especially
    useful for phylogenomic analyses, where you may want to only focus on gene clusters
    that are prevalent across the set of genomes you wish to analyze.

  description: This filter will remove gene clusters from your report. Let's assume
    you have 100 genomes in your pan genome analysis. You can use this parameter if
    you want to work only with gene clusters that occur in at most X number of genomes.
    If you say '--max-num- genomes-gene-cluster-occurs 1', you will get gene clusters
    that are singletons. Combining this parameter with --min-num-genomes-gene-cluster-occurs
    can give you a very precise way to filter your gene clusters.

  description: This filter will remove gene clusters from your report. If you say
    '--min-num-genes-from-each-genome 2', this filter will remove every gene cluster,
    to which every genome in your analysis contributed less than 2 genes. This can
    be useful to find out gene clusters with many genes from many genomes (such as
    conserved multi-copy genes within a clade).

  description: This filter will remove gene clusters from your report. If you say
    '--max-num-genes-from-each-genome 1', every gene cluster that has more than one
    gene from any genome that contributes to it will be removed from your analysis.
    This could be useful to remove gene clusters with paralogs from your report for
    appropriate phylogenomic analyses. For instance, using '--max-num-genes-from-each-genome
    1' and 'min-num- genomes-gene-cluster-occurs X' where X is the total number of
    your genomes, would give you the single-copy gene clusters in your pan genome.

  description: This filter will remove genomes from your report. If you have a list
    of gene cluster names, you can use this parameter to omit any genome from your
    report if it is missing more than a number of genes you desire. For instance,
    if you have 100 genomes in your pan genome, and you are interested in working
    only with genomes that have all 5 specific gene clusters of your choice, you can
    use '--max-num-gene-clusters-missing- from-genome 4' to remove remove the bins
    that are missing more than 4 of those 5 genes. This is especially useful for phylogenomic
    analyses. Parameter 0 will remove any genome that is missing any of the genes.
