  doc: "Input files are aligned SAM files, rather than FASTQ files. Junction prediction\

    \ use 'samtools sort -n' if you are not sure that this is true for the output\
    \ of your alignment program. (2) You EITHER have alignment scores as additional\
    \ SAM fields with the form 'AS:i:n', where n is a positive integer and higher\
    \ values indicate a better alignment OR it defaults to calculating an alignment\
    \ score that is equal to the number of bases in the read minus the number of inserted\
    \ bases, deleted bases, and soft clipped bases in the alignment to the reference.\
