  description: Maximum number of unique positions to be used in the network. This
    may be one way to avoid extremely large network descriptions that would defeat
    the purpose of a quick visualization. If there are more unique positions in the
    variability profile, the program will randomly select a subset of them to match
    the `max- num-unique-positions`. The default is 0, which means all positions should
    be reported. Remember that the number of nodes in the network will also depend
    on the number of samples described in the variability profile.
