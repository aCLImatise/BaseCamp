  description: "pattern    The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids\
    \ are used. The symbol 'x' is used for a position where any amino acid is accepted.\
    \ Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids for a given\
    \ position, between square parentheses '[ ]'. For example: [ALT] stands for Ala\
    \ or Leu or Thr. Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly\
    \ brackets '{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a gven position. For\
    \ example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala and Met. Each element in\
    \ a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a '-'. (Optional in fuzztran) Repetition\
    \ of an element of the pattern can be indicated by following that element with\
    \ a numerical value or a numerical range between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds\
    \ to x-x-x, x(2,4) corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x. When a pattern is restricted\
    \ to either the N- or C-terminal of a sequence, that pattern either starts with\
    \ a '<' symbol or respectively ends with a '>' symbol. A period ends the pattern.\
    \ (Optional in fuzztran). For example, [DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C"
