help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\n  This script uses a Bismark alignment report to generate\
  \ a graphical HTML report page. Optionally, further reports of\n  the Bismark suite\
  \ such as deduplication, methylation extractor splitting or M-bias reports can be\
  \ specified as well. If several\n  Bismark reports are found in the same folder,\
  \ a separate report will be generated for each of these, whereby the output filename\n\
  \  will be derived from the Bismark alignment report file. bismark2report attempts\
  \ to find optional reports automatically based\n  on the file basename.\n\n\n  USAGE:\
  \ bismark2report [options]\n\n\n-o/--output <filename>     Name of the output file\
  \ (optional). If not specified explicitly, the output filename will be derived\n\
  \                           from the Bismark alignment report file. Specifying an\
  \ output filename only works if the HTML report is\n                           to\
  \ be generated for a single Bismark alignment report (and potentially additional\
  \ reports).\n\n--dir                      Output directory. Output is written to\
  \ the current directory if not specified explicitly.\n\n\n--alignment_report FILE\
  \    If not specified explicitly, bismark2report attempts to find Bismark report\
  \ file(s) in the current\n                           directory and produces a separate\
  \ HTML report for each mapping report file. Based on the basename of\n         \
  \                  the Bismark mapping report, bismark2report will also attempt\
  \ to find the other Bismark reports (see below)\n                           for\
  \ inclusion into the HTML report. Specifying a Bismark alignment report file is\
  \ mandatory.\n\n--dedup_report FILE        If not specified explicitly, bismark2report\
  \ attempts to find a deduplication report file with the same\n                 \
  \          basename as the Bismark mapping report (generated by deduplicate_bismark)\
  \ in the\n                           current working directory. Including a deduplication\
  \ report is optional, and using the FILE 'none'\n                           will\
  \ skip this step entirely.\n\n--splitting_report FILE    If not specified explicitly,\
  \ bismark2report attempts to find a splitting report file with the same\n      \
  \                     basename as the Bismark mapping report (generated by the Bismark\
  \ methylation extractor) in the current\n                           working directory.\
  \ Including a splitting report is optional, and using the FILE 'none' will skip\
  \ this\n                           step entirely.\n\n--mbias_report FILE       \
  \ If not specified explicitly, bismark2report attempts to find a single M-bias report\
  \ file with the same\n                           basename as the Bismark mapping\
  \ report (generated by the Bismark methylation extractor) in the current\n     \
  \                      working directory. Including an M-Bias report is optional,\
  \ and using the FILE 'none' will skip this step\n                           entirely.\n\
  \n--nucleotide_report FILE   If not specified explicitly, bismark2report attempts\
  \ to find a single nucleotide coverage report file\n                           with\
  \ the same basename as the Bismark mapping report (generated by Bismark with the\
  \ option\n                           '--nucleotide_coverage') in the current working\
  \ directory. Including a nucleotide coverage statistics\n                      \
  \     report is optional, and using the FILE 'none' will skip this report entirely.\n\
