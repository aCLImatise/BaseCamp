help_text: "clusterGenes - Cluster genes from genePred tracks\nusage:\n   clusterGenes\
  \ [options] outputFile database table1 ... tableN\n   clusterGenes [options] -trackNames\
  \ outputFile database track1 table1 ... trackN tableN\n\nWhere outputFile is a tab-separated\
  \ file describing the clustering,\ndatabase is a genome database such as mm4 or\
  \ hg16,\nand the table parameters are either tables in genePred format in that\n\
  database or genePred tab seperated files. If the input is all from files, the argument\n\
  can be `no'.\noptions:\n   -verbose=N - Print copious debugging info. 0 for none,\
  \ 3 for loads\n   -chrom=chrN - Just work this chromosome, maybe repeated.\n   -cds\
  \ - cluster only on CDS exons\n   -trackNames - If specified, input are pairs of\
  \ track names and files.\n    This is useful when the file names don't reflact the\
  \ desired track\n    names.\n   -ignoreStrand - cluster postive and negative strand\
  \ together\n   -clusterBed=bed - output BED file for each cluster.  If -cds is specified,\n\
  \    this only contains bounds based on CDS\n   -clusterTxBed=bed - output BED file\
  \ for each cluster.  If -cds is specified,\n    this contains bounds based on full\
  \ transcript range of genes, not just CDS\n   -flatBed=bed - output BED file that\
  \ contains the exons of all genes\n    flattned into a single record. If -cds is\
  \ specified, this only contains\n    bounds based on CDS\n   -joinContained - join\
  \ genes that are contained within a larger loci\n    into that loci. Intended as\
  \ a way to handled fragments and exon-level\n    predictsions, as genes-in-introns\
  \ on the same strand are very rare.\n   -conflicted - detect conflicted loci. Conflicted\
  \ loci are loci that\n    contain genes that share not sequence.  This option greatly\
  \ increases\n    size of output file.\n\nThe cdsConflicts and exonConflicts columns\
  \ contains `y' if the cluster has\nconficts. A conflict is a cluster where all of\
  \ the genes don't share exons. \nConflicts maybe either internal to a table or between\
  \ tables.\n\n"
