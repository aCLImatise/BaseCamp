    \ a difference between using this flag (where even intermediate motifs will avoid\
    \ these hits) and taking the low-scoring instances out of the final alignments\
    \ (which might be combinations of motifs in which the sequence would have been\
    \ lower-scoring)."

  description: create tab-delimited <file> containing timing stats on various sub-processes
    of this script.  the first tab-delimited field is the description of the sub-process,
    the second field is the total CPU time (user+sys) and the third field is the wall-clock
    time.  Sub-processes can occur in multiple lines if they are run multiple timers,
    so the caller should add them.  Due to my laziness, the time of the clustalw program
    (if used) is not counted.
