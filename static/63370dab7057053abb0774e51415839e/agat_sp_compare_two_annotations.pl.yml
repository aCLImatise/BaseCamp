  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_compare_two_annotations.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ aims to compare two annotation of the same assembly. It\n    provided information\
  \ about split/fusion of genes between the two\n    annotations. The most common\
  \ case are: 1 => 0 ( gene uniq to file1) 0 =>\n    1 ( gene uniq to file2) 1 =>\
  \ 1 ( 1 gene from file 1 overlaps only 1 gene\n    from file2) 1 => <many> ( 1 gene\
  \ from file 1 overlaps <many> genes from\n    file2) => split case (with file 1\
  \ as reference) <many> => 1 ( <many>\n    genes from file 1 overlap only 1 gene\
  \ from file2) => fusion case (with\n    file 1 as reference)\n\n    Then you can\
  \ get more complex cases: <many> => <many> (<many> genes from\n    file 1 overlap\
  \ <many> genes from file2)\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_compare_two_annotations.pl\
