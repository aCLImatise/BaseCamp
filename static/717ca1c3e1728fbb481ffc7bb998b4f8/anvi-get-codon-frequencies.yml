  description: Anvi'o contigs database generated by 'anvi-gen- contigs'

  - -c

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: CONTIGS_DB
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: OK. You can declare a single gene caller ID if you wish, in which case
    anvi'o would only return results for a single gene call. If you don't declare
    anything, well, you must be prepared to brace yourself if you are working with
    a very large contigs database with hundreds of thousands of genes.

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default, anvi'o will return codon frequencies (as the name suggests),
    but you can ask for amino acid frequencies instead, simply because you always
    need more data and more stuff. You're lucky this time, but is there an end to
    this? Will you ever be satisfied with what you have? Anvi'o needs answers.

  description: Instead of actual counts, report percent-normalized frequencies per
    gene (because you are too lazy to do things the proper way in R).
  synonyms:
  - --percent-normalize
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: This is a flag to percent normalize codon frequenies within those that
    encode for the same amino acid. It is different from the flag --percent-normalize,
    since it does not percent normalize frequencies of codons within a gene based
    on all codon frequencies. Clearly this flag is not applicable if you wish to work
    with boring amino acids. WHO WORKS WITH AMINO ACIDS ANYWAYS.
