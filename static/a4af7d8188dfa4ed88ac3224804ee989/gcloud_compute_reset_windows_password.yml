help_text: "NAME\n    gcloud compute reset-windows-password - reset and return a password\
  \ for a\n        Windows machine instance\n\nSYNOPSIS\n    gcloud compute reset-windows-password\
  \ INSTANCE_NAME [--user=USER]\n        [--zone=ZONE] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG ...]\n\n\
  DESCRIPTION\n    gcloud compute reset-windows-password allows a user to reset and\
  \ retrieve a\n    password for a Windows virtual machine instance. If the Windows\
  \ account\n    does not exist, this command will cause the account to be created\
  \ and the\n    password for that new account will be returned.\n\n    For Windows\
  \ instances that are running a domain controller, running this\n    command creates\
  \ a new domain user if the user does not exist, or resets the\n    password if the\
  \ user does exist. It is not possible to use this command to\n    create a local\
  \ user on a domain-controller instance.\n\n    For all other instances, including\
  \ domain-joined instances, running this\n    command creates a local user or resets\
  \ the password for a local user.\n\n    WARNING: Resetting a password for an existing\
  \ user can cause the loss of\n    data encrypted with the current Windows password,\
  \ such as encrypted files\n    or stored passwords.\n\n    The user running this\
  \ command must have write permission for the Google\n    Compute Engine project\
  \ containing the Windows instance.\n\nPOSITIONAL ARGUMENTS\n     INSTANCE_NAME\n\
  \        The name of the instance to operate on.\n\nFLAGS\n     --user=USER\n  \
  \      USER specifies the username to get the password for. If omitted, the\n  \
  \      username is derived from your authenticated account email address.\n\n  \
  \   --zone=ZONE\n        The zone of the instance to operate on. If not specified,\
  \ you may be\n        prompted to select a zone. gcloud will attempt to identify\
  \ the zone by\n        searching for resources in your project. If the zone cannot\
  \ be\n        determined, you will then be prompted with all Google Cloud Platform\n\
  \        zones.\n\n        To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can\
  \ set the\n        compute/zone property:\n\n            $ gcloud config set compute/zone\
  \ ZONE\n\n        A list of zones can be fetched by running:\n\n            $ gcloud\
  \ compute zones list\n\n        To unset the property, run:\n\n            $ gcloud\
  \ config unset compute/zone\n\n        Alternatively, the zone can be stored in\
  \ the environment variable\n        CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE.\n\nGCLOUD WIDE FLAGS\n\
  \    These flags are available to all commands: --account, --configuration,\n  \
  \  --flatten, --format, --help, --log-http, --project, --quiet, --trace-token,\n\
  \    --user-output-enabled, --verbosity. Run $ gcloud help for details.\n"
