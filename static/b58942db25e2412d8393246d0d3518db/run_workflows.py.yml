  \ 2) the second use case is more complex, e.g., with -nt 3\nthreads, the following\
  \ 10 scripts have to be completed in the following\norders: the first 3 need to\
  \ complete first, and then the next 4 need to\ncomplete, and then finally the next\
  \ 3 will need to complete: run_workflows.py\n-scripts 1.sh 2.sh 3.sh 4.sh 5.sh 6.sh\
