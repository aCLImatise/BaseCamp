    num_threads: "Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast."
    log_file: "File path to store debug/output messages."
    trna_hits_file: "File path to store raw hits from tRNA scan."
    trna_cut_off_score: "Minimum score to assume a hit comes from a proper tRNA gene (passed to the tRNAScan-SE). The default is 20. It can get any value between 0-100."
    just_do_it: "Don't bother me with questions or warnings, just do it."
