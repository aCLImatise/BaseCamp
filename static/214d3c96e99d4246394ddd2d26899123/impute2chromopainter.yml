help_text: "CONVERTS PHASED SHAPEIT/IMPUTE2 OUTPUT TO CHROMOPAINTER-STYLE INPUT FILES\n\
  usage:   perl impute2chromopainter.pl <options> impute_output_file.haps output_filename_prefix\n\
  where:\n        (i) impute_output_file.haps = filename of IMPUTE2 output file with\
  \ suffix \".haps\" that contains phased haplotypes\n        (ii) output_filename_prefix\
  \ = filename prefix for chromopainter input file(s). The suffix \".phase\" is added\n\
  \nThe output, by default, is in CHROMOPAINTER v2 input format.\n<options>:\n-J:\
  \                 Jitter (add 1) snp locations if snps are not strictly ascending.\
  \ Otherwise an error is produced.\n<further options>   NOTE: YOU ONLY NEED THESE\
  \ OPTIONS FOR BACKWARDS COMPATABILITY!\n-v1:                Produce output compatible\
  \ with CHROMOPAINTER v1, i.e. include the line of \"S\" for each SNP. \n-f:    \
  \             By default, this script produces PHASE-style output, which differs\
  \ from \n\t\t\t   ChromoPainter input which requires an additional first line. \
  \ This option creates the correct\n\t\t           first line for standard fineSTRUCTURE\
  \ usage (i.e. the first line is \"0\", all other lines are appended)\n\nNOTE: TO\
  \ USE IN CHROMOPAINTER: You also need a recombination map. Create this with the\
  \ \"convertrecfile.pl\" or \"makeuniformrecfile.pl\" scripts provided.\n\n !!! WARNING:\
  \  THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY CHECK FOR MISSPECIFIED FILES. WE ARE NOT ACCOUNTABLE\
  \ FOR THIS RUNNING INCORRECTLY !!!\n"
