  \ License\n\nSYNOPSIS\nkissreads <toCheck.fasta> <readsC1.fasta> [<readsC2.fasta>\
  \ [<readsC3.fasta] ...] [-k value] [-c value] [-d value] [-O value] [-o name] [-u\
  \ name] [-n] [-I] [-i index_stride] [-m align_file] [-s] [-f] [-h] \n\nDESCRIPTION\n\
  Checks for each sequence contained into the toCheck.fasta if\nit is read coherent\
  \ (each position is covered by at least \"min_coverage\" read(s)) with reads from\
  \ readsA.fasta or readsB.fasta\nA sequence s from toCheck is treated as follow:\n\
  \  if (s coherent with at least one read set): output the sequence as follows\n\
  \  \t >original fasta comment|C1:min<avg-corr_avg<max|C2:min<avg-cor_avg<max|C3...:\n\
  \  \t >s\n  With A:min<avg-cor_avg<max standing for : value of the position having\
  \ minimal coverage in readsA.fasta < average coverage in readsA.fasta - R-squarred\
  \ corrected average in readsA.fa < value of the position having maximal coverage\
  \ in readsA.fasta\n  The coverage is the number of reads that perfectly mapped a\
  \ position\n  Any other situation (s not coherent with any): couple non read coherent,\
  \ not outputed \n\nOPTIONS\n\t -k size_seed: will use seeds of length size_seed.\
  \ Default: 25.\n\t -O minimal_read_overlap: a read can be mapped if its overlap\
  \ is a least \"minimal_read_overlap\". Default: k\n\t -c min_coverage: a sequence\
  \ is covered by at least min_coverage coherent reads. Default: 2\n\t -d max_substitutions:\
  \ Maximal number of substitutions authorized between a read and a fragment. Note\
  \ that no substitution is allowed on the central position while anaylizing the kissnp\
  \ output. Default: 1.\n\t -o file_name: write read-coherent outputs. Default: standard\
  \ output \n\t -u file_name: write unread-coherent outputs. Default: standard output\
  \ \n\t -n the input file (toCheck.fasta) is a kissnp output (incompatible with -I\
  \ option) \n\t\t in this case: 1/ only the upper characters are considered (no mapping\
  \ done on the extensions) and 2/ the central position (where the SNP occurs) is\
  \ strictly mapped, no subsitution is authorized on this position.\n\t -I the input\
  \ file (toCheck.fasta) is an Intl output (incompatible with -n option) \n\t -i index_stride\
  \ (int value). This is a heuristic for limiting the memory footprint. Instead of\
  \ indexing each kmer of the sequences contained into the toCheck.fasta, kissreads\
  \ indexes kmers occurring each \"index_stride\" position. Default = 1 (no heuristic)\n\
  \t -t max number of threads (also limited by number of input files)\n\t -m align_file,\
  \ write a file of reads mapped to sequences in file align_file\n\t -s silent mode\n\
