    windows. Please note: "RNAz" has the same options, so if you use "rnazWindow.pl"
    for an RNAz screen, we recommend to set the option directly in "RNAz" and leave
    the default here. (Default: ---forward)'

  description: By default the first sequence is interpreted as reference sequence.
    This means, for example, that if the reference sequence is removed during filtering
    steps the complete alignment is discarded. Also, if there are too many sequences
    in the alignment, the reference sequence is never removed when choosing an appropriate
    subset. Having a reference sequence is crucial if you are doing screens of genomic
    regions. For some other applications it might not be necessary and in such cases
    you can change the default behaviour by setting this option.

  description: By default, all sequences of all windows are discarded, if the length
    or base composition is outside the training range of RNAz, independent of the
    window-size commandline parameter. However with the flag --no-rangecheck such
    sequences outside the training range are not discarded. As of version 2.0, RNAz
    can cope with sequences outside this traning range. However the same quality of
    the RNAz results cannot be guaranteed if sequences outside the default range are
    present.
