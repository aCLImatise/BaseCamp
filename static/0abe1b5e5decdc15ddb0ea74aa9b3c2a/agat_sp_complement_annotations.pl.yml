  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_complement_annotations.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script\
  \ allows to complement a reference annotation with other\n    annotations. A l1\
  \ feature from the addfile.gff that does not overlap a\n    l1 feature from the\
  \ reference annotation will be added. A l1 feature\n    from the addfile.gff without\
  \ a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature with a CDS\n    from the reference annotation\
  \ will be added. A l1 feature from the\n    addfile.gff with a CDS that overlaps\
  \ a l1 feature without a CDS from the\n    reference annotation will be added. A\
  \ l1 feature from the addfile.gff\n    with a CDS that overlaps a l1 feature with\
  \ a CDS from the reference\n    annotation will be added only if the CDSs don't\
  \ overlap. A l1 feature\n    from the addfile.gff without a CDS that overlaps a\
  \ l1 feature without a\n    CDS from the reference annotation will be added only\
  \ if none of the l3\n    features overlap. /!\\ It is sufficiant that only one isoform\
  \ is\n    overlapping to prevent the whole gene (l1 feature) from the addfile.gff\n\
  \    to be added in the output.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sp_complement_annotations.pl\
