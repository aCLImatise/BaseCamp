        differ in size or modification time and you run gsutil rsync -p, the file
        will be copied and ACL preserved. However, if the source and destination don't
        differ in size or checksum but have different ACLs, running gsutil rsync -p
        will have no effect. Note that this option has performance and cost implications
        when using the XML API, as it requires separate HTTP calls for interacting
        with ACLs. The performance issue can be mitigated to some degree by using
        gsutil -m rsync to cause parallel synchronization. Also, this option only
        works if you have OWNER access to all of the objects that are copied. You
        can avoid the additional performance and cost of using rsync -p if you want
        all objects in the destination bucket to end up with the same ACL by setting
        a default object ACL on that bucket instead of using rsync -p. See 'gsutil

        These are the user ID of the owner, the group ID of the owning group, the
        mode (permissions) of the file, and the access/modification time of the file.
        For downloads, these attributes will only be set if the source objects were
        uploaded with this flag enabled. On Windows, this flag will only set and restore
        access time and modification time. This is because Windows doesn't have a

        and setmeta) to run in parallel. This can significantly improve performance
        if you are performing operations on a large number of files over a reasonably
        fast network connection. gsutil performs the specified operation using a combination
        of multi-threading and multi-processing, using a number of threads and processors
        determined by the parallel_thread_count and parallel_process_count values
        set in the boto configuration file. You might want to experiment with these
        values, as the best values can vary based on a number of factors, including
        network speed, number of CPUs, and available memory. Using the -m option may
        make your performance worse if you are using a slower network, such as the
        typical network speeds offered by non-business home network plans. It can
        also make your performance worse for cases that perform all operations locally
        (e.g., gsutil rsync, where both source and destination URLs are on the local
        disk), because it can "thrash" your local disk. If a download or upload operation
        using parallel transfer fails before the entire transfer is complete (e.g.
        failing after 300 of 1000 files have been transferred), you will need to restart
        the entire transfer. Also, although most commands will normally fail upon
        encountering an error when the -m flag is disabled, all commands will continue
        to try all operations when -m is enabled with multiple threads or processes,

  - !Flag
    description: The -R and -r options are synonymous. Causes bucket or bucket subdirectory
      contents (all objects and subdirectories that it contains) to be removed recursively.
      If used with a bucket-only URL (like gs://bucket), after deleting objects and
      subdirectories gsutil will delete the bucket. This option implies the -a option
      and will delete all object versions.
