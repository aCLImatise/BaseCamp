id: ../../../ktImportFCP.cwl
inputs:
- id: fcp_output
  doc: Results of running any FCP classification tool (except BLASTN.py, which only
    outputs raw BLAST results). By default, separate datasets will be created for
    each input (see [-c]).
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    position: 0
- id: magnitudes
  doc: Optional file listing query IDs with magnitudes, separated by tabs. This can
    be used to account for read length or contig depth to obtain a more accurate representation
    of abundance. By default, query sequences without specified magnitudes will be
    assigned a magnitude of 1. Magnitude files for assemblies in ACE format can be
    created with ktGetContigMagnitudes.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    position: 1
- id: name
  doc: A name to show in the list of datasets in the Krona chart (if multiple input
    files are present and [-c] is not specified). By default, the basename of the
    file will be used. _________
