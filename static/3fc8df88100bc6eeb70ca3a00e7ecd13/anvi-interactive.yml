  description: If you have a collection in your profile database, you can use this
    flag to start the interactive interface with a tree showing your bins in your
    collection, instead of each split. This is very useful when you have imported
    your external binning results into anvi'o, and want to see the distribution of
    your bins across samples. In these cases anvi'o will cluster your bins and based
    on multiple metrics. Because this particular clustering will be done on the fly
    within anvi'o interactive class, you get to define a disntance metric and a linkage
    method using --linkage and --distance parameters if you want!

  description: Using this flag, you can run the interactive interface in an ad hoc
    manner using input files you curated instead of standard output files generated
    by an anvi'o run. In the manual mode you will be asked to provide a profile database.
    In this mode a profile database is only used to store 'state' of the interactive
    interface so you can reload your visual settings when you re-analyze the same
    files again. If the profile database you provide does not exist, anvi'o will create
    an empty one for you.

    this file will be visualized as a new layer in the tree.

  description: "Initiate the interactive interface in 'gene mode'. In this mode, the\
    \ items are genes (instead of splits of contigs). The following views are available:\
    \ detection (the detection value of each gene in each sample). The mean_coverage\
    \ (the mean coverage of genes). The non_outlier_mean_coverage (the mean coverage\
    \ of the non-outlier nucleotide positions of each gene in each sample (median\
    \ absolute deviation is used to remove outliers per gene per sample)). The non_outlier_coverage_std\
    \ view (standard deviation of the coverage of non-outlier positions of genes in\
    \ samples). You can also choose to order items and layers according to each one\
    \ of the aforementioned views. In addition, all layer ordering that are available\
    \ in the regular mode (i.e. the full mode where you have contigs/splits) are also\
    \ available in 'gene mode', so that, for example, you can choose to order the\
    \ layers according to 'detection', and that would be the order according to the\
    \ detection values of splits, whereas if you choose 'genes_detections' then the\
    \ order of layers would be according to the detection values of genes. Inspection\
    \ and sequence functionality are available (through the right-click menu), except\
    \ now sequences are of the specific gene. Inspection has now two options available:\
    \ 'Inspect Context', which brings you to the inspection page of the split to which\
    \ the gene belongs where the inspected gene will be highlighted in yellow in the\
    \ bottom, and 'Inspect Gene', which opens the inspection page only for the gene\
    \ and 100 nts around each side of it (the purpose of this option is to make the\
    \ inspection page load faster if you only want to look at the nucleotide coverage\
    \ of a specific gene). NOTICE: You can't store states or collections in 'gene\
    \ mode'. However, you still can make fake selections, and create fake bins for\
    \ your viewing convenience only (smiley). Search options are available, and you\
    \ can even search for functions if you have them in your contigs database. ANOTHER\
    \ NOTICE: loading this mode might take a while if your bin has many genes, and\
    \ your profile database has many samples, this is because the gene coverages stats\
    \ are computed in an ad-hoc manner when you load this mode, we know this is not\
    \ ideal and we plan to improve that (along with other things). If you have suggestions/complaints\
    \ regarding this mode please comment on this github issue: https://goo.gl/yHhRei.\
    \ Please refer to the online tutorial for more information."
