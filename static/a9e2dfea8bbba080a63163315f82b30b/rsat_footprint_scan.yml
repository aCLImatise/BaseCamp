  \ matrices (PSSM) in order to detect enriched\n    motifs, and thereby predict phylogenetically\

  \ [-v #] [...]\n\n\e[1mINPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n  \e[1mQuery gene(s)\e[0m\n    The analysis\
  \ can be performed either on a single gene, or several genes\n    separately (option\
  \ -sep_genes), or on a group of genes altogether.\n\n    Query genes can be entered\
  \ on the command line (option -q) or in a text\n    file (option-genes). Alternatively,\
  \ the option -all_genes will run the\n    analysis on all the genes of a genome.\n\
  \n  \e[1mPosition-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs)\e[0m\n    \e[33mfootprint-scan\e\
  [0m requires a collection of (at least one) position-specific\n    scoring matrices\
  \ (PSSM).\n\n    All the format supported by \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m can be used\
  \ to enter the\n    matrices. However, we recommend to use the TRANSFAC format,\
  \ which\n    supports multiple matrices (we usually want tos can promoters with\
  \ a\n    full collection of matrices), and associates an identifier with each\n\
  \    matrix (e.g. the name of the transcription factor).\n\n   Example of TRANSFAC\
  \ format\n    The following example shows a text file describing two matrices,\n\
  \    representing the binding motifs annotated in RegulonDB for AgaR and\n    AraC,\
  \ respectively. Motifs must be separated by a line containing a\n    double slash\
  \ (//).\n\n    The complete file can be downloaded from RegulonDB\n    (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/).\n\

  \n\e[1mEXAMPLES OF UTILIZATION\e[0m\n  \e[1mDetecting trans-acting factors for single\
  \ gene, with a collection of known motifs\e[0m\n    Let us assume that we have a\
  \ collection of PSSMs annotated for a given\n    organism (e.g. the matrices for\
  \ all the \e[33mEscherichia coli\e[0m transcription\n    factors annotated in RegulonDB).\
  \ We would likt to scan the promoters of\n    orthologs of a given gene, in order\
  \ to predict the transcription factors\n    that might be involved in its regulation.\
  \ The program will count the\n    hits for each matrix, and report those showing\
  \ a significant enrichment\n    in the promoters of its orthologs.\n\n    In this\
  \ example, we use a slightly higher verbosity than usually (-v 2)\n    in order\
  \ to keep track of the progress of the analysis. This also\n    reports the commands\
  \ that are executed, and allows us to examine all\n    their parameters.\n\n   \

  \ target genes for a given transcription factor\e[0m\n    Given a PSSM we would\
  \ like detect new putative binding sites for a given\n    transcription factor.\
  \ The usual approach would be to retrieve all\n    upstream sequences of the organism\
  \ of interest, and then search for\n    high-scoring sites with matrix-scan.\n\n\
  \    However, observing a single high scoring site in one promoter does not\n  \
  \  necessarily means that this gene is regulated by the potentially bound\n    transcription\
  \ factor.\n\n    As we know sequences with a functional relevance migth be conserved\n\
  \    througth some branches of phylogeny. So we expect binding sites with a\n  \
  \  functional rele- vance to be conserved in a group of close othologous\n    sequences.\
  \ footprint-scan can search for putative bindign sites in the\n    hole set of up-\
  \ stream regions of an organism while evaluating if the\n    detected binding sites\
  \ are conserved (over-represented) in the\n    respective orthologous sequences.\n\

  [1mfootprint-discovery\e[0m\n    The difference betsween \e[33mfootprint-scan\e\
  [0m and \e[33mfootprint-discovery\e[0m is that\n    \e[33mfootprint-scan\e[0m requires\
  \ prior knowledge of the motifs (in the form of\n    position-specific matrices),\
  \ whereas \e[33mfootprint-discovery\e[0m perfoms \e[33mab\n    initio\e[0m motif\
  \ discovery.\n\n\e[1mWISH LIST\e[0m\n  \e[1mOptions to be added\e[0m\n    \e[1m-rand\e\
  [0m\n        When the option \e[33m-rand\e[0m is activated, \e[33mfootprint-scan\e\
  [0m scans random\n        selections of promoters rather than promoters of orthologs.\n\
  \n        This option serves to perform negative controls in orde to estimate\n\
  \        empirically the rate of false prediction and check its\n        correspondence\
  \ with the theoretical estimation of the significance.\n\n        The random selections\
  \ are done by passing the option \e[33m-rand\e[0m to the\n        program \e[33mget-orthologs\e\
  [0m.\n\n    \e[1m-crer\e[0m\n        Return Cis-Regulatory elements Enriched-Regions\
  \ (CRER).\n\n        Calculate the statistical significance of the number of hits\
  \ in\n        windows of variable sizes. The number of hits is the sum of matches\n\
  \        above a predefined threshold set on hits p-values, for all matrices\n \
  \       and on both strands (if -2str). The maximum size for a CRER is\n       \
  \ defined by the option -crer_max.\n\n        The prior probability to find an instance\
  \ of the motif is the same\n        for all matrices, and corresponds to the chosen\
  \ pval threshold.\n        Within a region of maximal CRER size, subwindows are\
  \ defined between\n        each hits, and the observed number of matches in a subwindow\
  \ is the\n        sum of hits above the threshold. The significance of the observed\n\
  \        number of matches in a subwindow is estimated by calculating a\n      \
  \  P-value using the binomial distribution (Aerts et al., 2003).\n\n    \e[1m-lth_crer_size\e\

  \n  \e[1mWeb interface\e[0m\n    Alejandra Medina-Rivera will implement the Web\
  \ interface. It would be\n    more convenient to program the Web page after the\
  \ Web services, in order\n    to benefit ffrom the support of Web services (including\
  \ the token). To\n    be checked with Morgane Thomas-Chollier & Olivier Sand.\n\n\
  \  \e[1mTutorial\e[0m\n    It would be worth preparing a tutorial (or a chapter\
  \ in Methods in\n    Molecular Biology) to explain in detail the interpretation\
  \ of the\n    result.\n\n    The tutorial could cover the 3 interfaces (command-line,\
  \ Web services\n    and Web form).\n\n  \e[1mMotif co-occurrences\e[0m\n    After\
  \ having detected the motifs in the different sequences, analyze\n    their co-occurrences\
  \ in order to report the factors having sites in the\n    same sequences (putatively\
  \ interacting factors). Actually , this option\n    should be implemented in matrix-scan\
  \ rather than footprint-scan, because\n    it applies to any type of analysis.\n\
  \n  \e[1mNeighbout gene name in output table\e[0m\n    Add name of upstream neighbour\
  \ to the synthetic tables, in order to\n    detect pairs of gene sharing the same\
  \ promoter.\n\n\e[1mOPTIONS\e[0m\n    \e[1m-m matrix_file\e[0m\n        Matrix file.\
  \ This argument is mandatory.\n\n        This argument can be used iteratively to\
  \ scan the sequence with\n        multiple matrices.\n\n    \e[1m-matrix_format\
  \ matrix_format\e[0m\n        Matrix format. Default is tab. This argument is mandatory.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-matrix_suffix matrix_suffix\e[0m\n        Matrix suffix. This argument\
  \ is mandatory.\n\n        The matrix suffix indicates the nature of the matrix\
  \ file. For\n        example, if your matrix file contains a single matrix for a\n\
  \        transcription factor (say LexA), you can indicate it with\n\n        -matrix_suffix\
  \ LexA\n\n        whereas if your matrix files contains all the matrices from the\n\
  \        RegulonDB database, you can specify\n\n        -matrix_suffix RegulonDB\n\
  \n        The matrix suffix will be concatenated to the output prefix, in\n    \
  \    order to maintain separate output files for distinct analyses\n        performed\
  \ on the same promoter sequences. For example, if you run\n        successively\
  \ the analysis with the matrix LexA, and then with the\n        matrix CRP, you\
  \ don't want to loose the results of the first\n        scanning when running the\
  \ second scanning.\n\n    \e[1m-tf transcription_factor\e[0m\n        Most matrices\
  \ are derived from specific TFBS, so they represent the\n        preferential sequence\
  \ where a TF binds. This option will search for\n        all the genomes in the\
  \ given taxon where there is an ortholog for\n        the specified tf. Orthologs\
  \ for the query genes will only be\n        retrived if the organism has an ortholog\
  \ for the TF.\n\n        -tf gene_name\n\n        If the option -matrix_table is\
  \ used instead of the name of an\n        specific TF specify the names are in the\
  \ file using:\n\n        -tf file\n\n    \e[1m-pseudo #\e[0m\n        Pseudo-count\
  \ for the matrix (default: 1). See matrix-scan for\n        details.\n\n    \e[1m-bgfile\
  \ background_file\e[0m\n        Background model file.\n\n    \e[1m-bg_format background_format\e\
  [0m\n        Format of background model file. For supported formats see:\n     \

  \ model from the input sequence set.\n\n    \e[1m-markov\e[0m\n        Order of\
  \ the markov chain for the background model.\n\n        This option is incompatible\
  \ with the option -bgfile.\n\n    \e[1m-window\e[0m\n        Size of the sliding\
  \ window for the background model calculation.\n        When this option is specified,\
  \ the matrix pseudo-count is equally\n        distributed.\n\n        The background\
  \ model is calculated locally at each step of the scan,\n        by computing transition\
  \ frequencies from a sliding window centred\n        around the considered segment.\
  \ The model is thus updated at each\n        scanned position. This model is called\
  \ \"adaptive\". Note that the\n        sliding window must be large enough to train\
  \ the local Markov model.\n        The required sequence length increases exponentially\
  \ with the Markov\n        order. This option is thus usually suitable for low order\
  \ models\n        only (-markov 0 to 1).\n\n        This option is incompatible\
  \ with the option -bgfile.\n\n    \e[1m-tree\e[0m Phylogenetic tree use for the\
  \ Bayesian Branch Length Scoring task,\n    it should be in Newick format with distances\
  \ and leaf names.\n    \e[1m-bbls_draw\e[0m Fomat for the output image. Represents\
  \ the phylogenetic tree\n    of organisms with ortholog genes. Shows the conservation\
  \ of the motif\n    across the tree over the p-value. The default value is png (png,\
  \ pdf or\n    none).\n    \e[1m-bg_pseudo #\e[0m\n        Pseudo frequency for the\
  \ background model. Value must be a real\n        between 0 and 1.\n\n        If\
  \ this option is not specified, the pseudo-frequency value depends\n        on the\
