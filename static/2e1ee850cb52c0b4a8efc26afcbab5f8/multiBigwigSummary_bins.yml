  \   User defined labels instead of default labels from\n                       \

  \  --smartLabels         Instead of manually specifying labels for the input\n \
  \                       bigWig files, this causes deepTools to use the file\n  \

  \                        List of chromosomes that you do not want to be\n      \
  \                  included. Useful to remove \"random\" or \"extra\" chr.\n   \

  \              By default, multiBigwigSummary considers adjacent bins\n        \
  \                of the specified --binSize. However, to reduce the\n          \
  \              computation time, a larger distance between bins can\n          \
  \              be given. Larger distances results in fewer considered\n        \

  \        Region of the genome to limit the operation to - this\n               \
  \         is useful when testing parameters to reduce the\n                    \

  \ None)\n  --blackListFileName BED file [BED file ...], -bl BED file [BED file ...]\n\
  \                        A BED or GTF file containing regions that should be\n \
  \                       excluded from all analyses. Currently this works by\n  \
  \                      rejecting genomic chunks that happen to overlap an\n    \
  \                    entry. Consequently, for BAM files, if a read\n           \
  \             partially overlaps a blacklisted region or a fragment\n          \
  \              spans over it, then the read/fragment might still be\n          \
  \              considered. Please note that you should adjust the\n            \
  \            effective genome size, if relevant. (default: None)\n  --numberOfProcessors\
  \ INT, -p INT\n                        Number of processors to use. Type \"max/2\"\
  \ to use half\n                        the maximum number of processors or \"max\"\
  \ to use all\n                        available processors. (Default: 1)\n  --verbose,\
  \ -v         Set to see processing messages. (default: False)\n\nOutput optional\
  \ options:\n  --outRawCounts FILE   Save average scores per region for each bigWig\
  \ file to\n                        a single tab-delimited file. (default: None)\n\

  \ files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on\n                        deepBlue, this\
  \ specifies the server URL. The default\n                        is \"http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc\"\
  , which\n                        should not be changed without good reason. (default:\n\
  \                        http://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xmlrpc)\n  --userKey USERKEY\
  \     For remote files bedgraph/wiggle files hosted on\n                       \
  \ deepBlue, this specifies the user key to use for\n                        access.\
  \ The default is \"anonymous_key\", which suffices\n                        for\
  \ public datasets. If you need access to a\n                        restricted access/private\
  \ dataset, then request a key\n                        from deepBlue and specify\
  \ it here. (default:\n                        anonymous_key)\n  --deepBlueTempDir\
  \ DEEPBLUETEMPDIR\n                        If specified, temporary files from preloading\

  \ specified, temporary bigWig files from preloading\n                        deepBlue\
  \ datasets are not deleted. A message will be\n                        printed noting\
  \ where these files are and what sample\n                        they correspond\
  \ to. These can then be used if you wish\n                        to analyse the\
  \ same sample with the same regions\n                        again. (default: False)\n"
