  \n\nName:\n    agat_sq_mask.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script masks GFF-denoted\
  \ segments out of a FASTA format file. This\n    script masks (hard or soft) repeats\
  \ among sequences. It needs 3 input\n    parameters: a gff3 file, a fasta file,\
  \ and a Mask method. The result is\n    written to the specified output file, or\
  \ to STDOUT.\n\nUsage:\n        agat_sq_mask.pl -g infile.gff -f infile.fasta  (-hm\
  \ or -sm) [ -o outfile ]\n        agat_sq_mask.pl --help\n\nOptions:\n    -g, --gff\
