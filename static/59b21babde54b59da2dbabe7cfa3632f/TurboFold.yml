help_text: "===================================\n==== Configuration File Format ====\n\
  ===================================\nNote that configuration options are not case-sensitive.\n\
  Any unrecognized options are ignored.\n\nConfiguration file line format:\n<Option>\
  \ = <Value>\n\nRequired input when specifying file groups\n------------------------------------------\n\
  The sequence and CT file groups must each specify the same number of files.\n\n\
  InSeq\n    Flag that can be used to specify a group of sequence files, from Seq1\
  \ to\n    Seq<SequenceNumber>. Only one sequence file group can be specified without\n\
  \    overwriting files. Group format: {seq1File;seq2File;seq3File;}\n\nOutCT\n \
  \   Flag that can be used to specify a group of CT files, from CT1 to\n    CT<SequenceNumber>.\
  \ Only one CT file group can be specified without\n    overwriting files. Group\
  \ format: {ct1File;ct2File;ct3File;}\n\nMode\n    The mode in which TurboFold is\
  \ run. A mode can be specified in the\n    following ways. 1) MEA (Maximum expected\
  \ accuracy). 2) ProbKnot\n    (Pseudoknots). 3) Threshold (Probable pairs).\n\n\
  Required input when specifying files singly\n-------------------------------------------\n\
  Every specified sequence file must have a corresponding CT file specified.\n\nSequenceNumber\n\
  \    The number of sequences given as input.\n\nSeq1 ... Seq<SequenceNumber>\n \
  \   Names of sequence files used as input, from 1 to SequenceNumber.\n\nCT1 ...\
  \ CT<SequenceNumber>\n    Names of CT files written as output, from 1 to SequenceNumber.\n\
  \nMode\n    The mode in which TurboFold is run. A mode can be specified in the\n\
  \    following ways. 1) MEA (Maximum expected accuracy). 2) ProbKnot\n    (Pseudoknots).\
  \ 3) Threshold (Probable pairs).\n\nGeneral options\n---------------\nGamma\n  \
  \  The TurboFold gamma.\n    Default is 0.3.\n\nIterations\n    The number of iterations\
  \ TurboFold goes through.\n    Default is 3 iterations.\n\nMaximumPairingDistance\n\
  \    The maximum distance between nucleotides that can pair. For nucleotide i to\n\
  \    pair with j, [i - j| < MaximumPairingDistance. This applies to each\n    sequence.\n\
  \    Default is no limit.\n\nSave1 ... Save<SequenceNumber>\n    Names of save files\
  \ written to by TurboFold, from 1 to SequenceNumber. The\n    number at the end\
  \ of the flag (1 to SequenceNumber) identifies which\n    sequence the save file\
  \ will be written for.\n\nSHAPE1 ... SHAPE<SequenceNumber>\n    Names of SHAPE constraint\
  \ files. The number at the end of the flag (1 to\n    SequenceNumber) identifies\
  \ which sequence the constraints will be applied\n    to.\n\nSHAPEintercept\n  \
  \  The SHAPE intercept. This value is only used when at least one SHAPE\n    constraint\
  \ file is specified.\n    Default is 1.8 kcal/mol.\n\nSHAPEslope\n    The SHAPE\
  \ slope. This value is only used when at least one SHAPE constraint\n    file is\
  \ specified.\n    Default is -0.6 kcal/mol.\n\nTemperature\n    The temperature\
  \ at which calculations are run, in Kelvin.\n    Default is 310.15 K, which is 37\
  \ degrees C.\n\nAlnFormat\n    The final output alignment format.\n    Default is\
  \ Clustal.\n\nColumnNumber\n    The maximum column number in the final output alignment.\n\
  \    Default is 60.\n\nMaximum expected accuracy (MEA) mode options\n--------------------------------------------\n\
  MaxPercent\n    The maximum percent energy difference.\n    Default is 50 percent\
  \ (Specified as 50, not 0.5).\n\nMaxStructures\n    The maximum number of structures.\n\
  \    Default is 1000 structures.\n\nMeaGamma\n    The weight given to pairs.\n \
  \   Default is 1.0.\n\nWindow\n    The window size.\n    Default is 5 nucleotides.\n\
  \nPseudoknot (ProbKnot) mode options\n----------------------------------\nMinHelixLength\n\
  \    The minimum helix length.\n    Default is 3 nucleotides.\n\nPkIterations\n\
  \    The number of iterations.\n    Default is 1 iteration.\n\nProbable pairs (Threshold)\
  \ mode options\n---------------------------------------\nThreshold\n    The threshold\
  \ at which pairs should be included in a structure. This should\n    be expressed\
  \ as a number: 0.5 <= x <= 1.0.\n    Default is 0, which signifies that structures\
  \ should be generated at\n    multiple thresholds: >= 0.99, >= 0.97, >= 0.95, >=\
  \ 0.90, >= 0.80, >= 0.70,\n    >= 0.60, and >= 0.50.\n\n"
