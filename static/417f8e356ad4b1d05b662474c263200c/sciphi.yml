  description: PCR substitution rate. An error early during the PCR  amplification
    can result in high allele fractions.  These are typically filtered out by requiring
    at least two cells to be mutated. However, sometimes the PCR  error in one cell
    is a real mutation in others. If in  such a scenario the coverage for the cell
    with the PCR error is high, SCIPhI will introduce false positives.  This can be
    avoided by specifying the PCR error rate.  As these events are rather unlikely
    very small values, such as 0.0000001 should be chosen. In practice 0  works very
    well.  [0]
