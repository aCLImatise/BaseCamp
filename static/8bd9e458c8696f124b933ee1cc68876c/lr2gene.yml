help_text: "    Usage: /tmp/tmp4lcqgdoa/bin/lr2gene.pl [-aPH] [-cy] [-F float] [-s\
  \ min_amplicon_#] [-A float] [-D float] cov2lr.txt\n\n    The /tmp/tmp4lcqgdoa/bin/lr2gene.pl\
  \ program will convert a coverage file to copy number profile.  The default parameters\
  \ are designed for\n    detecting such aberrations for high tumor purity samples,\
  \ such as cancer cell lines.  For clinical samples,\n    many parameters need to\
  \ be adjusted.\n\n    Arguments are:\n    cov2lr.txt:  The coverage output file\
  \ from cov2lr.pl script.  Can also take from standard in or more than\n        \
  \           one file.\n\n    Options are:\n\n    -c Indidate that control sample\
  \ is used for normalization\n    -y Debugging mode\n\n    -s int\n       The minimum\
  \ consecutive amplicons to look for deletions and amplifications.  Default: 1. \
  \ Use with caution\n       when it is less than 3.  There might be more false positives.\
  \  Though it has been successfully applied with\n       option \"-s 1\" and identified\
  \ one-exon deletion of PTEN and TP53 that were confirmed by RNA-seq.\n\n\n    For\
  \ whole gene:\n    -A float\n       Minimum log2 ratio for a whole gene to be considered\
  \ amplified.  Default: 1.50\n\n    -D float\n       Minimum log2 ratio for a whole\
  \ gene to be considered deleted.  Default: -2.00\n\n\n    For < 3 exons:\n    -E\
  \ float\n       Minimum mean log2 ratio difference for <3 exon deletion/amplification\
  \ to be called.  Default: 1.25\n\n    -M float\n       When considering partial\
  \ deletions less than 3 exons/amplicons, the minimum MAD value, in addition to -E,\n\
  \       before considering it to be amplified or deleted.  Default: 10\n\n    -d\
  \ float\n       When considering >=3 exons deletion/amplification within a gene,\
  \ the minimum differences between the log2 of two segments.\n       Default: 0.5\n\
  \n    -p float (0-1)\n       The p-value for t-test when consecutive exons/amplicons\
  \ are >= 3.  Default: 0.00001\n\n\n    For break point in the middle of the gene:\n\
  \    -e float\n       When considering breakpoint in the middle of a gene, the minimum\
  \ number of exons.  Default: 5\n\n    -t float\n       When considering breakpoint\
  \ in the middle of a gene, the minimum differences between the log2 of two segments.\n\
  \       Default: 0.4\n\n    -P float (0-1)\n       The p-value for t-test when the\
  \ breakpoint is in the middle with min exons/amplicons >= [-e].  Default: 0.000001\n\
  \n    For cohort level aberrations:\n    -R float (0-1)\n       If a breakpoint\
  \ has been detected more than \"float\" fraction of samples, it is considered false\
  \ positive and removed.\n       Default: 0.03, or 3%.  Use in combination with -N\n\
  \n    -N int\n       If a breakpoint has been detected more than \"int\" samples,\
  \ it is considered false positives and removed.\n       Default: 5.  Use in combination\
  \ with -R.\n\nAUTHOR\n       Written by Zhongwu Lai, AstraZeneca, Boston, USA\n\n\
