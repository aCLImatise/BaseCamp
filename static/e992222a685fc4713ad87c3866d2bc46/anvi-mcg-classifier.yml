  description: "For those of you who wish to dig deeper, a collection of figures could\
    \ be created to allow you to get insight into how the classification was generated.\
    \ This is especially useful to identify cases in which you shouldn't trust the\
    \ classification (for example due to a large number of outliers). NOTICE: if you\
    \ ask anvi'o to generate these figures then it will significantly extend the execution\
    \ time. To learn about which figures are created and what they mean, contact your\
    \ nearest anvi'o developer, because currently it is a well-hidden secret."

  description: If you only wish to get statistics regarding the occurrence of bins
    in samples, then use this flag. Especially when dealing with many samples or large
    genomes, gene stats could be a long time to compute. By using this flag you could
    save a lot of computation time.

  description: Determines the range of sample detection values that are considered
    negative, ambiguous or positive. Min of 0 and smaller than 0.5, default of 0.25.
    For exmaple for the default samples with detection below 0.5-0.25 = 0.25 will
    be considered negative (i.e. donot contain the genome), samples with detection
    between 0.25 and 0.75 would be ambiguous (and hence would not be used for the
    classification), and samples with detection above 0.75 would be considered positive
    (i.e. contain the genome).

  description: If you want all zero coverage positions to be treated like outliers
    then use this flag. The reason to treat zero coverage as outliers is because when
    mapping reads to a reference we could get many zero positions due to accessory
    genes. These positions then skew the average values that we compute.
