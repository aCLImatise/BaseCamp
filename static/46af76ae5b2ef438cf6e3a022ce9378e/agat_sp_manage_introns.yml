  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_manage_introns.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The script provides\
  \ information about introns (longest, shortest size\n    mean ...) using the statistic\
  \ method, then plot all the intron size\n    values to get an overview of the introns\
  \ size distribution. It gives you\n    as well the value of the longest intron after\
  \ removing X percent(s) of\n    the longest (removing potential biais / false positive).\n\
  \nUsage:\n        agat_sp_manage_introns.pl --gff infile [--out outFile]\n     \
  \   agat_sp_manage_introns.pl --help\n\nOptions:\n    --gff, -f, --ref or -reffile\n\
  \            Input GTF/GFF file. You can use several input files by doing: -f\n\
  \            file1 -f file2 -f file3\n\n    -w, --window, --break, --breaks or -b\n\
  \            It the number of break used within the histogram plot. By\n       \
  \     default it's 1000. You can modify the value to get something\n           \
  \ more or less precise.\n\n    -x, --p Allows to modify the X values to calculate\
  \ the percentage of the\n            longest introns to remove. By default the value\
  \ is 1 (We remove\n            1 percent of the longest).\n\n    --plot  Allows\
  \ to create an histogram in pdf of intron sizes\n            distribution.\n\n \
  \   --out, --output or -o\n            Output gff3 file where the gene incriminated\
  \ will be write.\n\n    --help or -h\n            Display this helpful text.\n\n\
