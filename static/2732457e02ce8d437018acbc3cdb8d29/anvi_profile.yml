  \ change it if\n                        you are not sure this is what you want to\
  \ do.\n  -V INT, --min-coverage-for-variability INT\n                        Minimum\
  \ coverage of a nucleotide position to be\n                        subjected to\
  \ SNV profiling. By default, anvi'o will\n                        not attempt to\
  \ make sense of variation in a given\n                        nucleotide position\
  \ if it is covered less than 10X.\n                        You can change that minimum\
  \ using this parameter.\n\nCONTIGS:\n  Sweet parameters of convenience\n\n  --list-contigs\
  \        When declared, the program will list contigs in the\n                 \
  \       BAM file and exit gracefully without any further\n                     \
  \   analysis.\n  --contigs-of-interest FILE\n                        It is possible\
  \ to analyze only a group of contigs from\n                        a given BAM file.\
  \ If you provide a text file, in which\n                        every contig of\
  \ interest is listed line by line, the\n                        profiler would engine\
  \ only on those contigs in the BAM\n                        file and ignore the\
  \ rest. This can be used for\n                        debugging purposes, or to\
  \ engine on a particular group\n                        of contigs that were identified\
  \ as relevant during the\n                        interactive analysis.\n\nPERFORMANCE:\n\
  \  Performance settings for profiler\n\n  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS\n\
  \                        Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading\n \
  \                       whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is\n\
  \                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs\n\
  \                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with\n\
  \                        this option if you are running your commands on a SGE\n\
  \                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for\n \
  \                       multiple threads to use, you may deplete your\n        \
  \                resources very fast.\n  --queue-size INT      The queue size for\
  \ worker threads to store data to\n                        communicate to the main\
  \ thread. The default is set by\n                        the class based on the\
  \ number of threads. If you have\n                        *any* hesitation about\
  \ whether you know what you are\n                        doing, you should not change\
  \ this value.\n  --write-buffer-size-per-thread INT\n                        How\
  \ many items should be kept in memory before they\n                        are written\
  \ do the disk. The default is 500 per\n                        thread. So a single-threaded\
  \ job would have a write\n                        buffer size of 500, whereas a\
  \ job with 4 threads would\n                        have a write buffer size of\
  \ 4*500. The larger the\n                        buffer size, the less frequent\
  \ the program will access\n                        to the disk, yet the more memory\
  \ will be consumed\n                        since the processed items will be cleared\
  \ off the\n                        memory only after they are written to the disk.\
  \ The\n                        default buffer size will likely work for most cases.\n\
  \                        Please keep an eye on the memory usage output to make\n\
  \                        sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the\n   \
  \                     physical memory.\n  --force-multi         This is not useful\
  \ to non-developers. It forces the\n                        multi-process routine\
  \ even when 1 thread is chosen.\n"
