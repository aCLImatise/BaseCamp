help_text: "Usage: pairs_triplet_dist [-v] <filename1> <filename2> [<output filename>]\n\
  \nWhere: <filename1> and <filename2> point to two files each containing\nthe same\
  \ number of trees in Newick format. The two trees on line i in\nthe two files must\
  \ have the same set of leaf labels.\nThe output is a list of numbers, where the\
  \ i'th number is the triplet\ndistance between the two trees on line i in the two\
  \ files.\nIf [output filename] is specified the output is written to the file\n\
  pointed to (if the file already exists the current content is deleted\nfirst), otherwise\
  \ the output is written to stdout.\nIf the -v option is used, the following numbers\
  \ will be reported for\neach pair of trees (in this order):\n\t - The number of\
  \ leaves in the trees (should be the same for both).\n\t - The number of triplets\
  \ in the two trees (n choose 3).\n\t - The triplet distance between the two trees.\n\
  \t - The normalized triplet distance between the two trees.\n\t - The number of\
  \ resolved triplets that agree in the two trees.\n\t - The normalized number of\
  \ resolved triplets that agree in the two trees.\n\t - The number of triplets that\
  \ are unresolved in both trees.\n\t - The normalized number of triplets that are\
  \ unresolved in both trees.\n\n"
