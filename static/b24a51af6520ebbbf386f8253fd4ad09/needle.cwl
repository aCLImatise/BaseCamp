  doc: float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty is the score taken
    away when a gap is created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison
    matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein
    sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences. (Floating point number
    from 1.0 to 100.0)

- id: gap_extend
  doc: float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension, penalty is added to the
    standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
    are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short
    gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception
    is where one or both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors
    in which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result
    by setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension
    penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating point number from 0.0 to 10.0)
