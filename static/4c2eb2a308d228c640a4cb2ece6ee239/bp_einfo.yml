help_text: "NAME\n    bp_einfo - Query einfo to find all available databases or information\n\
  \    about a specific database (field information or links to other NCBI\n    databases).\n\
  \nVERSION\n    version 1.75\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     bp_einfo [-d database] [-f Field Code]\
  \ [-l Link Name] [-o outfile]\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    Command line options:\n\n    \
  \  -e/--email\n            Valid email (required by NCBI policy)\n\n      -d/--db/--database\n\
  \            NCBI database to query\n            (default = none, which shows available\
  \ databases)\n\n      -f/--field\n            print out information about a specific\
  \ field code\n            (default = none)\n\n      -l/--link\n            print\
  \ out information about a specific link name\n            (default = none)\n\n \
  \     -o/--out\n            outfile\n            (default = STDOUT)\n\n      -h/--help\n\
  \            show this documentation\n\n    As per NCBI's policy regarding eutils\
  \ access, a valid email is required.\n    This is not enforced here (if one is provided\
  \ you will get a standard\n    warning), but don't be surprised if this doesn't\
  \ work after June 1, 2010\n    unless one is supplied.\n\n    If -d is not specified,\
  \ field and link arguments are ignored and all\n    available databases are printed\
  \ instead.\n\n    If either link names or field codes (or both) are specified, nothing\n\
  \    else is printed out (only the info requested). You can specify as many\n  \
  \  fields and/or links as you want by using multiple -f/-l <ARG> on the\n    command\
  \ line.\n\nFEEDBACK\n  Mailing lists\n    User feedback is an integral part of the\
  \ evolution of this and other\n    Bioperl modules. Send your comments and suggestions\
  \ preferably to the\n    Bioperl mailing list. Your participation is much appreciated.\n\
