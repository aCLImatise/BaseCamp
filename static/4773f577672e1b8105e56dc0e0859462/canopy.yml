  description: (=0.4)           Max pearson correlation difference  between a canopy
    center and a point in  which the point will be considered  close to the canopy.

    neighbours  during the canopy walk.

  description: (=0.05)          Max pearson correlation difference  between two canopy
    centers in which the canopies should be merged. Please note, that the final canopy
    profiles are  calculated after the merge step and  consequently some final canopies
    might  have profiles that are closer then  max_merge_dist specifies.
