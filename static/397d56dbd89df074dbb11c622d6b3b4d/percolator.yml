  description: Q-value threshold that will be  used in the computation of the MSE  and
    ROC AUC score in the grid  search. Recommended 0.05 for  normal size datasets
    and 0.1 for  large datasets. Default = 0.1

    name: value
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Number of nested cross validation  bins within each cross validation  bin.
    This should reduce  overfitting of the  hyperparameters. Default = 1.

  description: Activates spectral counting on  protein level (either  --fido-protein
    or --picked-protein  has to be set) at the specified  PSM q-value threshold. Adds
    two  columns, "spec_count_unique" and  "spec_count_all", to the protein  tab separated
    output, containing  the spectral count for the  peptides unique to the protein
    and  the spectral count including  shared peptides respectively.

  description: Enforce that, for each spectrum,  at most one PSM is included in the  positive
    set during each training  iteration. If the user only  provides one PSM per spectrum,  this
    filter will have no effect.

  - --train-best-positive
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Set the FDR threshold for the  first iteration. This is useful in  cases
    where the original features  do not display a good separation  between targets
    and decoys. In  subsequent iterations, the normal  --trainFDR will be used.

  description: Read flags from a parameter file.  If flags are specified on the  command
    line as well, these will  override the ones in the parameter  file.
