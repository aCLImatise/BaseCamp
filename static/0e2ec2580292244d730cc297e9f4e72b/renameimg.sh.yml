help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified August 23, 2017\n\nDescription:\
  \  Renames img records to be prefixed by their id.\nThis is for internal JGI use\
  \ and has no external utility.\n\nUsage:  renameimg.sh in=auto out=renamed.fa.gz\n\
  \nParameters:\nin=         3-column tsv with imgID, taxID, and file path.\n    \
  \        These files will have their sequences renamed and concatenated.\nimg= \
  \       Optional, if a different (presumably bigger) file will be used for taxonomic\
  \ assignment.\n            For example, in could be a subset of img, potentially\
  \ with incorrect taxIDs.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx        This will set Java's memory\
  \ usage, overriding autodetection.\n            -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of\
  \ RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n                    The max is typically\
  \ 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom       This flag will cause the process to exit\
  \ if an out-of-memory exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da         Disable\
  \ assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter\
  \ any problems.\n\n"
