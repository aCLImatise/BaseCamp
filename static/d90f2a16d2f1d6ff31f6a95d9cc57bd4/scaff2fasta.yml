  \n.DESCRIPTION.\n  Produces a .scaffolds.fasta file of the bases of contigs in the\n\
  \  order and orientation found in a Celera scaffold.  <prefix>.asm \n  file is required\
  \ as input.\n\n.OPTIONS.\n  if -gaps is provided outputs a number of Ns proportional\
  \ to gap size (a minimum of 100 Ns)\n  if -linker is provided uses the <linker>\
  \ sequence as separator between contigs\n  if neither -gaps nor -linker are given,\
  \ the space between contigs is filled with 100 Ns\n  if -contig is provided also\
  \ generates a .contig-like file for the scaffold\n\n.KEYWORDS.\n  converters, scaffolds\n\
