  description: For this entire thing to work, the genome you are focusing on should
    be detected in at least one metagenome. If that is not the case, it would mean
    that you do not have any sample that represents the niche for this organism (or
    you do not have enough depth of coverage) to investigate the detection of genes
    in the environment. By default, this script requires at least '0.5' of the genome
    to be detected in at least one metagenome. This parameter allows you to change
    that. 0 would mean no detection test required, 1 would mean the entire genome
    must be detected.

  description: The value set here will be used to remove a gene if its total coverage
    across environments is less than the median coverage of all genes multiplied by
    this value. The default is 0.25, which means, if the median total coverage of
    all genes across all samples is 100X, then, a gene with a total coverage of less
    than 25X across all samples will be assumed not a part of the 'environmental core'.
