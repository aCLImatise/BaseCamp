    scgs_taxonomy_data_dir: "The directory for SCGs data to be stored (or read\\nfrom, depending on the context). If you leave it as is\\nwithout specifying anything, anvi'o will set up\\neverything in (or try to read things from) a pre-\\ndefined default directory. The advantage of using the\\ndefault directory at the time of set up is that every\\nuser of anvi'o on a computer system will be using a\\nsingle data directory, but then you may need to run\\nthe setup program with superuser privileges. If you\\ndon't have superuser privileges, then you can use this\\nparameter to tell anvi'o the location you wish to use\\nto setup your databases. If you are using a program\\n(such as `anvi-run-scg-taxonomy` or `anvi-estimate-\\nscg-taxonomy`) you will have to use this parameter to\\ntell those programs where your data are."
    min_percent_identity: "The defualt value for this is 90.0%, and in an ideal\\nworld you sholdn't really change it. Lowering this\\nvalue will probably give you too many hits from\\nneighboring genomes, which may ruin your consensus\\ntaxonomy (imagine, at 90% identity you may match to a\\nsingle species, but at 70% identity you may match to\\nevery species in a genus and your consensus assignment\\nmay be influenced by that). But once in a while you\\nwill have a genome that doesn't have any close match\\nin GTDB, and you will be curious to find out what it\\ncould be. So, when you are getting no SCG hits\\nwhatsoever, only then you may want to play with this\\nvalue. In those cases you can run anvi-estimate-scg-\\ntaxonomy with a `--debug` flag to see what is really\\ngoing on. We strongly advice you to do this only with\\nsingle genomes, and never with metagenomes."
    num_parallel_processes: "Maximum number of processes to run in parallel. Please\\nnote that this is different than number of threads. If\\nyou ask for 4 parallel processes, and 5 threads,\\nanvi'o will run four processes in parallel and assign\\n5 threads to each. For resource allocation you must\\nmultiply the number of processes and threads."
    num_threads: "Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading\\nwhenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is\\n1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs\\n/ cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with\\nthis option if you are running your commands on a SGE\\n--if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for\\nmultiple threads to use, you may deplete your\\nresources very fast."
    write_buffer_size: "How many items should be kept in memory before they\\nare written do the disk. The default is 500. The\\nlarger the buffer size, the less frequent the program\\nwill access to the disk, yet the more memory will be\\nconsumed since the processed items will be cleared off\\nthe memory only after they are written to the disk.\\nThe default buffer size will likely work for most\\ncases, but if you feel you need to reduce it, we trust\\nyou. Please keep an eye on the memory usage output to\\nmake sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the\\nphysical memory.\\n"
