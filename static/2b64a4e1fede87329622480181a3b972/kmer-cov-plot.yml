help_text: "Usage: kmer-cov-plot KMER_FILE < (FASTA_FILE | FASTQ_FILE)\nPrints the\
  \ k-mer coverage beginning at each base in a set of DNA sequences.\n\nThe set of\
  \ DNA sequences is read as a FASTA or FASTQ file from standard input.\nKMER_FILE\
  \ specifies a FASTA file that contains the k-mer counts for\nthe set of DNA sequences.\
  \  Each FASTA tag line provides a k-mer count,\nand the following sequence line\
  \ provides the k-mer.  Alternatively,\nKMER_FILE may specify a Jellyfish hash table\
  \ if the -j option is given.\n\nThe k-mer length is determined automatically from\
  \ the KMER_FILE.\n\nBy default, the tag line of sequence is printed, followed\n\
  by a line for each k-mer in the sequence. The first column is the index\nof the\
  \ k-mer, starting from 1, and the remaining three columns are:\n     (count(fmer)\
  \ + count(rmer))   count(fmer)   count(rmer)\nwhere count(fmer) indicates the count\
  \ of the forward k-mer and count(rmer)\nindicates the count of the reverse k-mer.\n\
  \nOptions:\n  -j, --jellyfish      Use k-mer counts from a Jellyfish hash table.\n\
  \                       KMER_FILE specifies a hash table produced by the\n     \
  \                  `jellyfish count' command.  Only available if\n             \
  \          compiled with Jellyfish support.  Note: Jellyfish's\n               \
  \        hash table is optimized for memory usage and\n                       multithreaded\
  \ updating, so it is slower than a\n                       normal hash table for\
  \ lookups.\n\n  -l, --jellyfish-preload\n                       Access the Jellyfish\
  \ hash table sequentially before\n                       beginning plotting the\
  \ k-mer coverage.  This can\n                       greatly improve performance\
  \ on large Jellyfish\n                       files that have not been pre-loaded\
  \ into the\n                       kernel's buffer cache, as they would otherwise\n\
  \                       be accessed randomly and gradually be loaded into\n    \
  \                   memory by random page faults.  If you do not have\n        \
  \               enough memory to hold the entire hash table in memory,\n       \
  \                this option will not be very helpful.\n\n  -r, --ranges=RANGE[,RANGE]...\n\
  \                       Only print the k-mer coverages at the positions\n      \
  \                 specified by the comma-separated list of ranges.\n           \
  \            Each range is two numbers separated by a colon.\n                 \
  \      Positive integral numbers are taken to be base\n                       positions\
  \ numbered starting at 1.  Negative integral\n                       numbers are\
  \ taken to be base positions from the\n                       end of the sequence\
  \ (e.g. -1 is the last base in\n                       the sequence).  Floating-point\
  \ numbers are handled\n                       similarly, but are first multiplied\
  \ by the number of\n                       k-mers in the sequence.  Examples:\n\
  \                       --ranges=1:10,-10:-1 to print the k-mer coverage of\n  \
  \                     the first and last 10 k-mers of each sequence;\n         \
  \              --ranges=0.45:0.55 to print k-mer coverage of the\n             \
  \          the middle 10% of each sequence's k-mers.  The output\n             \
  \          is in ascending order of base position and no position\n            \
  \           is printed multiple times.\n\n  -t, --tabular        Output the information\
  \ as one read per line, as the\n                       FASTA/FASTQ tag followed\
  \ by the k-mer coverage\n                       values, tab-delimited.  The coverage\
  \ of invalid\n                       k-mers is marked as -1.  Without -f, the sum\
  \ of\n                       the coverage of the forward and reverse complement\n\
  \                       k-mers is printed.  Cannot be used with\n              \
  \         --display-kmers.\n\n  -k, --display-kmers  Display the actual k-mer in\
  \ addition to the counts.\n                         Cannot be used with --tabular.\n\
  \  -f, --forward-only   Display count (and k-mer with -k) for the forward k-mer\n\
  \                         only.\n  -s, --sum-only       Display only the combined\
  \ count of the forward and\n                         reverse complement k-mers.\
  \  Default with --tabular.\n  -n, --no-tags        Do not print sequence tags.\n\
  \  -N, --no-indices     Do not print the index of each k-mer.  Ignored if\n    \
