  \           not treated like single nucleotide variants in anvi-\n             \
  \           trnaseq: they do not cause the seed sequence to be\n               \
  \         split such that no seed contains a variant that was\n                \
  \        not deemed to be a modification. Rather, candidate\n                  \
  \      modification positions that do not meet this threshold\n                \
  \        are retained in the seed BUT NOT REPORTED. Therefore,\n               \
  \         we recommend rerunning this command with a parameter\n               \
  \         value of 0 to inspect seeds for undisplayed variants\n               \
  \         (possible SNVs) with a low level of third and fourth\n               \
  \         nucleotides. (default: 0.002)\n  --min-del-fraction FLOAT\n          \
  \              This parameter controls which deletions are reported\n          \
  \              in the tRNA-seq profile database. Coverage of a\n               \
  \         deletion in a sample must meet the minimum fraction of\n             \
  \           specific coverage. Deletion coverages are calculated\n             \
  \           separately for specific, nonspecific, and summed\n                 \
  \       coverages. (default: 0.01)\n  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC\n             \
  \           The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.\n             \
  \           The default distance metric is 'euclidean'. You can\n              \
  \          find the full list of distance metrics either by\n                  \
  \      making a mistake (such as entering a non-existent\n                     \
  \   distance metric and making anvi'o upset), or by taking\n                   \
  \     a look at the help menu of the\n                        hierarchy.distance.pdist\
  \ function in the scipy.cluster\n                        module.\n  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD\n\
  \                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.\n \
  \                       The default linkage method is 'ward', because that is\n\
  \                        the best one. It really is. We talked to a lot of\n   \
  \                     people and they were all like 'this is the best one\n    \
  \                    available' and it is just all out there. Honestly it\n    \
  \                    is so good that we will build a wall around it and\n      \
  \                  make other linkage methods pay for it. But if you want\n    \
  \                    to see a full list of available ones you can check the\n  \
  \                      hierarcy.linkage function in the scipy.cluster module.\n\
  \                        Up to you really. But then you can't use ward anymore,\n\
  \                        and you would have to leave anvi'o right now.\n\n‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ\n\
  \n\U0001F525 Program description:\n\n   A program that processes one or more anvio'\
  \ tRNA-seq databases generated by\n   `anvi-trnaseq` to generate anvi'o contigs\
  \ and merged profile databases that\n   are accessible to the rest of the tools\
  \ in anvi'o software ecosystem.\n   Briefly, this program will determine final seed\
  \ sequences from input tRNA-seq\n   databases, determine their coverages across\
  \ samples, identify tRNA\n   modification sites, and INDELs associated with transcripts\
  \ in each sample\n   against the seed sequences and store all these data into resulting\
  \ databases\n   for interactive visualization of the data or in-depth analysis using\
  \ other\n   anvi'o frameworks\n\n\U0001F9C0 Can consume: \n\n   trnaseq-db\n   \n\
  \U0001F355 Can provide: \n\n   contigs-db / profile-db\n   \n\U0001F37A More on\
