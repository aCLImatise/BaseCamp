  \                  \n                  This implementation does only compute a boundary\
  \ term and does not use\n                  any regional term. The desired boundary\
  \ term can be selected via the\n                  --boundary argument. Depending\
  \ on the selected term, an additional\n                  image has to be supplied\
  \ as badditional.\n                  \n                  In the case of the stawiaski\
  \ boundary term, this is the gradient image.\n                  In the case of the\
  \ difference of means, it is the original image.\n                  \n         \
  \         Furthermore the algorithm requires the region map of the original\n  \
  \                image, a binary image with foreground markers and a binary\n  \
  \                image with background markers.\n                  \n          \
  \        Additionally a filename for the created binary mask marking foreground\n\
  \                  and background has to be supplied.\n                  \n    \
  \              Note that the input images must be of the same dimensionality,\n\
  \                  otherwise an exception is thrown.\n                  Note to\
  \ take into account the input images orientation.\n                  Note that the\
  \ quality of the resulting segmentations depends also on\n                  the\
  \ quality of the supplied markers.\n                  \n                  Copyright\
