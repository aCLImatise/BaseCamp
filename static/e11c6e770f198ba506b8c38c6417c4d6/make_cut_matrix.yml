  \ experiment and a\nBED file of motifs, creates a matrix of counts of the transposition\n\
  integration events (cuts) around the motifs.\n\nBINNING\n=======\n\nEach motif in\
  \ the BED file is scored for each of the given fragment\nlength bins. The bins are\
  \ specified as a list of groups, each group\ncomprising one or more bins, and ending\
  \ with a resolution value, which\ncontrols how many individual cuts in the extended\
  \ region around the\nmotif are aggregated. Within the motif itself, we always count\
  \ the cut\npoints for each base. A complete example:\n\n    (36-149 1) (150-224\
  \ 225-324 2) (325-400 5)\n\nWith a resolution of 1, every base in the extended region\
  \ around motifs\noverlapping fragments of length 36-149 would be scored independently;\n\
  each base's cut count would be added to the matrix.\n\nThe second group, for fragments\
  \ of length 150-224 or 225-324, with a\nresolution of 2, would result in every two\
  \ bases in the extended region\naround motifs being added together. Then the aggregate\
  \ scores of the two\nbins in the group would be summed, and the result would be\
  \ added to the\nmatrix.\n\nThe last bin group, (325-400 5), with a resolution of\
  \ 5, would also\nproduce aggregate scores in the extended region, each being the\
  \ sum of\nfive bases' cut counts.\n\nTo illustrate, assume these settings and an\
  \ imaginary motif 5 bases\nlong, with a 10-base extended region on either side,\
  \ and for the sake of\nexample pretend that each fragment length bin had the same\
  \ counts of cut\npoints around the motif, shown here:\n\nextended region     motif\
  \     extended region\n------------------- --------- -------------------\n0 1 2\
  \ 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 9 2 0 2 7 5 4 4 4 4 3 3 2 1 0\n\nThe scores for the first bin group,\
  \ (36-149 1):\n\nextended region     motif     extended region\n-------------------\
  \ --------- -------------------\n0 1 2 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 9 2 0 2 7 5 4 4 4 4 3 3 2 1\
  \ 0\n\nThe scores for the second bin group, (150-224 225-324 2):\n\ne.r.      motif\
  \     e.r.\n--------- --------- ---------\n1 5 7 8 9 9 2 0 2 7 9 8 7 5 1\n\nThe\
  \ scores for the last bin group, (325-400 5):\n\ne.r. motif     e.r.\n---- ---------\
  \ ----\n9 21 9 2 0 2 7 21 9\n\nINPUT\n=====\n\nBAM files just work.\n\nBED files\
  \ mean different things to different people. We\nrequire a file of tab-separated\
  \ values, where the first six\nfields (and their labels in the BED format documentation\
  \ at\nhttps://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html) are:\n\n1. The reference sequence\
  \ name ('chrom'): text\n2. The feature start position ('chromStart'): integer\n\
  3. The feature end position ('chromEnd'): integer\n4. The name of the feature ('name'):\
  \ text\n5. The feature's score ('score'): number\n6. The feature's strand ('strand'):\
  \ '+' or '-'\n\nExtra fields are ignored.\n\nOUTPUT\n======\n\nYou can request either\
  \ discrete or aggregate output. Discrete output is\nintended to be usable as input\
  \ to CENTIPEDE. After you've run CENTIPEDE,\nyou can feed different parts of the\
  \ resulting BED file back into this\nscript and request aggregate output to produce\
  \ a file suitable for\nplotting with out plot_aggregate_matrix.R script. As an example,\
  \ we like\nto visualize all motifs with a posterior probability of binding >0.95\n\
  and a random sampling of motifs with a posterior probability of\n<0.5. This provides\
  \ a good visual inspection of the results.\n\nEach row of the discrete matrix represents\
  \ the cut point counts around a\nsingle motif from your input BED file. The positions\
  \ reported depend on\nthe resolution specified in the --bins argument. For example,\
  \ specifying\na resolution of 1 will result in single nucleotide resolution -- you'll\n\
  get the count at each position in the extended region around the\nmotif. Specifying\
  \ 10 will report the sum of every 10 positions.\n\nAggregate output reports absolute\
  \ and mean cut point counts for all of\nyour motifs at each position in the region\
  \ around the motif, for each\nstrand and for each fragment size bin represented\
  \ at that position.\n\n\0\n"
