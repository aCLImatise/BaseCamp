  doc: Approach to reporting overlaps between A and B. neither Report overlaps if
    neither end of A overlaps B. either  Report overlaps if either ends of A overlap
    B. both    Report overlaps if both ends of A overlap B. notboth Report overlaps

  doc: 'The amount of slop (in b.p.). to be added to each footprint of A. *Note*:
    Slop is subtracted from start1 and start2 and added to end1 and end2. - Default

  doc: Add slop based to each BEDPE footprint based on strand. - If strand is "+",
    slop is only added to the end coordinates. - If strand is "-", slop is only added
    to the start coordinates. - By default, slop is added in both directions.
