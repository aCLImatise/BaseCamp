- !Flag
  description: For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B. - Reports
    0 for A entries that have no overlap with B. - Overlaps restricted by -w, -l,
    and -r.
  synonyms:
  - -c
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Only report those entries in A that have _no overlaps_ with B. - Similar
    to "grep -v."
