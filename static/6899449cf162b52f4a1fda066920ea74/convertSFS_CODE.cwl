    \ <ingroup> to <outgroup>.  By default, will print the MK table for the true data\
    \ (saved during simulation) summed over all loci & iterations, with each entry\
    \ space delimited.  Using \"OBS\" option will print the observed MK table based\
    \ on parsimony (by default a single sequence from the outgroup will be used for\
    \ divergence, but specifying OG_size can change this). Use \"F\" to print output\
    \ to the file <file> (include 'a' to append to file instead of over-writing it).\
    \  Use \"L\" to print specific loci (<#loci> = -1 prints seperate MK tables at\
    \ each locus).  To print each iteration indepdently, use  'ITS' option (to print\
    \ only a subset of iterations,  include the number of iterations [#its].  Using\
    \ the \"OGSS\" option sets the outgroup size to <OG_size>, such that any mutation\
    \ carried by the first <OG_size> chromosomes in the outgroup will be considered\
    \ a fixed difference (setting <OG_size> = -1 is uses the entire sample size).\
    \ Each MK table is printed in the following order: <PS> <PN> <FS> <FN>, where\
    \ 'P' refers to polymorphic, 'F' fixed, 'S' synonymous and 'N' is nonsynonymous."
