  description: The directory for SCGs data to be stored (or read from, depending on
    the context). If you leave it as is without specifying anything, anvi'o will set
    up everything in (or try to read things from) a pre- defined default directory.
    The advantage of using the default directory at the time of set up is that every
    user of anvi'o on a computer system will be using a single data directory, but
    then you may need to run the setup program with superuser privileges. If you don't
    have superuser privileges, then you can use this parameter to tell anvi'o the
    location you wish to use to setup your databases. If you are using a program (such
    as `anvi-run-scg-taxonomy` or `anvi-estimate- scg-taxonomy`) you will have to
    use this parameter to tell those programs where your data are.

  description: The defualt value for this is 90.0%, and in an ideal world you sholdn't
    really change it. Lowering this value will probably give you too many hits from
    neighboring genomes, which may ruin your consensus taxonomy (imagine, at 90% identity
    you may match to a single species, but at 70% identity you may match to every
    species in a genus and your consensus assignment may be influenced by that). But
    once in a while you will have a genome that doesn't have any close match in GTDB,
    and you will be curious to find out what it could be. So, when you are getting
    no SCG hits whatsoever, only then you may want to play with this value. In those
    cases you can run anvi-estimate-scg- taxonomy with a `--debug` flag to see what
    is really going on. We strongly advice you to do this only with single genomes,
    and never with metagenomes.

  description: Maximum number of processes to run in parallel. Please note that this
    is different than number of threads. If you ask for 4 parallel processes, and
    5 threads, anvi'o will run four processes in parallel and assign 5 threads to
    each. For resource allocation you must multiply the number of processes and threads.

  description: Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading whenever possible.
    Very conservatively, the default is 1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number
    of CPUs / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with this option if you
    are running your commands on a SGE --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking
    for multiple threads to use, you may deplete your resources very fast.

  - -T

- !Flag
  description: How many items should be kept in memory before they are written do
    the disk. The default is 500. The larger the buffer size, the less frequent the
    program will access to the disk, yet the more memory will be consumed since the
    processed items will be cleared off the memory only after they are written to
    the disk. The default buffer size will likely work for most cases, but if you
    feel you need to reduce it, we trust you. Please keep an eye on the memory usage
    output to make sure the memory use never exceeds the size of the physical memory.
