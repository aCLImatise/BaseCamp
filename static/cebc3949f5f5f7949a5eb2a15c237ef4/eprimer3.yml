    probe (hyb probe) to detect the PCR product after amplification.

  description: "integer    [5] The maximum number of primer pairs to return. Primer\
    \ pairs returned are sorted by their 'quality', in other words by the value of\
    \ the objective function (where a lower number indicates a better primer pair).\
    \ Caution: setting this parameter to a large value will increase running time.\
    \ (Integer 0 or more)"

  description: range      [(full sequence)] A sub-region of the given sequence in
    which to pick primers. For example, often the first dozen or so bases of a sequence
    are vector, and should be excluded from consideration. The value for this parameter
    has the form (start),(end) where (start) is the index of the first base to consider,
    and (end) is the last in the primer-picking region.

  description: range      [(full sequence)] If one or more Targets is specified then
    a legal primer pair must flank at least one of them. A Target might be a simple
    sequence repeat site (for example a CA repeat) or a single-base-pair polymorphism.
    The value should be a space-separated list of (start),(end) pairs where (start)
    is the index of the first base of a Target, and (end) is the last E.g. 50,51 requires
    primers to surround the 2 bases at positions 50 and 51.

  description: range      [(full sequence)] Primer oligos may not overlap any region
    specified in this tag. The associated value must be a space-separated list of
    (start),(end) pairs where (start) is the index of the first base of the excluded
    region, and and (end) is the last. This tag is useful for tasks such as excluding
    regions of low sequence quality or for excluding regions containing repetitive
    elements such as ALUs or LINEs. E.g. 401,407 68,70 forbids selection of primers
    in the 7 bases starting at 401 and the 3 bases at 68.
