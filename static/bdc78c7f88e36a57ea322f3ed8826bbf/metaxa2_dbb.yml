help_text: "Usage: metaxa2_dbb -i <input file> -o <output file>\nOptions:\n-i {file}\
  \ : DNA FASTA file containing the reference sequences of a single gene to be used\
  \ for classification (overrides specific input options below)\n-o {directory} :\
  \ Directory name for the output files\n-g {string} : Gene name for the database\n\
  -p {directory} : Use HMMs from the specified directory instead of computing new\
  \ ones (i.e. only build a new classification database), not used by default\n-t\
  \ {file} : Taxonomy file containing taxonomic information to be parsed in any of\
  \ the following formats:\n            Metaxa2, FASTA, ASN1, NCBI XML, INSD XML\n\
  -r {sequence_ID} : ID of the sequence that should be used as the representative\
  \ sequence of the gene\n                   if blank, the first sequence in the input\
  \ file is used\n--auto_rep {T or F} : Choose a reference sequence automatically\
  \ (requires Usearch to be installed), on (T) by default\n--cpu {integer} : Number\
  \ of CPUs to use (will be passed on to other programs), default = 1\n--save_raw\
  \ {T or F} : Keep intermediate files after the program finishes, off (F) by default\n\
  --plus {T or F} : Use BLAST+ instead of legacy BLAST, off (F) by default\n\n\n-a\
  \ {file} : DNA FASTA file containing archaeal reference sequences to be used for\
  \ classification (cannot be combined with the -i option)\n-b {file} : DNA FASTA\
  \ file containing bacterial reference sequences to be used for classification (cannot\
  \ be combined with the -i option)\n-c {file} : DNA FASTA file containing chloroplast\
  \ reference sequences to be used for classification (cannot be combined with the\
  \ -i option)\n-e {file} : DNA FASTA file containing eukaryote reference sequences\
  \ to be used for classification (cannot be combined with the -i option)\n-m {file}\
  \ : DNA FASTA file containing mitochondrial reference sequences to be used for classification\
  \ (cannot be combined with the -i option)\n-n {file} : DNA FASTA file containing\
  \ metazoan mitochondrial reference sequences to be used for classification (cannot\
  \ be combined with the -i option)\n--other {file} : DNA FASTA file containing reference\
  \ sequences of other origins to be used for classification (cannot be combined with\
  \ the -i option)\n\n--full_length {integer} : number of basepairs to use for full-length\
  \ definition (set to zero to disable full-length extraction), default = 100\n-C\
  \ {integer} : Conservation score cutoff, 4 by default, not used unless -A is set\
  \ to false (F)\n-N {ratio} : Noise cutoff (minimal proportion of sequences required\
  \ to be considered at each position). A number between 0 and 1, 0.1 by default\n\
  -A {T or F} : Auto-detect conservation score cutoff, on (T) by default\n-P {ratio}\
  \ : Minimal conserved proportion of the alignment (until a lower conservation cutoff\
  \ is considered), 0.6 by default\n-L {integer} : Look-ahead length (the number of\
  \ residues to consider when determining the start and end of conserved regions),\
  \ 5 by default\n-M {integer} : Minimal conserved region length, 20 by default\n\
  --single_profile {T or F} : Build only one single HMM for the entire alignment from\
  \ the input sequences, off (F) by default\n--mode {divergent, conserved, hybrid}\
  \ : Selects the mode in which the profile database is built, default is divergent\n\
  --dereplicate {ratio or F} : Will dereplicate the input data using Usearch before\
  \ building the database, using the specified idenity threshold, off (F) by default\n\
  \n--filter_uncultured {T or F} : Will try to filter out sequences that are derived\
  \ from uncultured species, off (F) by default\n--filter_level {integer} : Will filter\
  \ out sequences with taxonomic information lower than the specified level, 0 by\
  \ default\n--correct_taxonomy {T or F} : Will try to correct the taxonomic information\
  \ at order, family, genus and species level, off (F) by default\n--cutoffs {string}\
  \ : A string of number defining the cutoffs at different taxonomic levels. Will\
  \ turn off automatic calculation of cutoffs. If blank, cutoffs are determined automatically,\
  \ default is blank (off)\n--sample {integer} : The number of sequences to aim to\
  \ investigate when determining taxonomic cutoffs, 1000 by default\n\n--evaluate\
  \ {T or F} : Statistically evaluate the performance of the database built. This\
  \ increases the time requirement for the process dramatically, off (F) by default\n\
  --iterations {integer} : Number of iterations for the statistical evaluation, 10\
  \ by default\n--test_sets {ratio} : Proportion of sequences to leave out for testing.\
  \ Several values can be specified, separated by commas, 0.1 by default\n--db {directory}\
  \ : Skips building the database, and only runs the evaluation on the specified database,\
  \ not used by default\n\n-h : displays this help message\n--help : displays this\
  \ help message\n--bugs : displays the bug fixes and known bugs in this version of\
