    For this option to work you need to have installed ghostscript and a few programs
    from the ViennaRNA package. More precisely you need the following executables
    in your PATH: "gs", "RNAalifold", "colorrna.pl", "coloraln.pl". Alternatively
    you can adjust the locations of these programs directly in the "rnazCluster.pl"
    script. Please note that if you use this option the program will get very slow
    because the figures have to be generated. It is also important that you have run
    RNAz with the "--show-gaps" option!'
