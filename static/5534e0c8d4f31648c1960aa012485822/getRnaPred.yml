help_text: "getRnaPred - Get virtual RNA for gene predictions\nusage:\n   getRnaPred\
  \ [options] database table chromosome output.fa\ntable can be a table or a file.\
  \  Specify chromosome of 'all' to\nto process all chromosome\n\noptions:\n   -weird\
  \ - only get ones with weird splice sites\n   -cdsUpper - output CDS in upper case\n\
  \   -cdsOnly - only output CDS\n   -cdsOut=file - write CDS to this tab-separated\
  \ file, in the form\n      acc  start  end\n    where start..end are genbank style,\
  \ one-based coordinates\n   -keepMasking - un/masked in upper/lower case.\n   -pslOut=psl\
  \ - output a PSLs for the virtual mRNAs.  Allows virtual\n    mRNA to be analyzed\
  \ by tools that work on PSLs\n   -suffix=suf - append suffix to each id to avoid\
  \ confusion with mRNAs\n    use to define the genes.\n   -peptides - out the translation\
  \ of the CDS to a peptide sequence.\n    The newer program genePredToProt maybe\
  \ produce better results in cases\n    were there are frame-shifting indels in the\
  \ CDS.\n   -exonIndices - output indices of exon boundaries after sequence name,\n\
  \    e.g., \"103 243 290\" says positions 1-103 are from the first exon,\n    positions\
  \ 104-243 are from the second exon, etc. \n   -maxSize=size - output a maximum of\
  \ size characters.  Useful when\n    testing gene predictions by RT-PCR.\n   -genomeSeqs=spec\
  \ - get genome sequences from the specified nib directory\n    or 2bit file instead\
  \ of going though the path found in chromInfo.\n   -includeCoords - include the\
  \ genomic coordinates as a comment in the\n    fasta header.  This is necessary\
  \ when there are multiple genePreds\n    with the same name.\n   -genePredExt -\
  \ (for use with -peptides) use extended genePred format,\n    and consider frame\
  \ information when translating (Warning: only\n    considers offset at 5' end, not\
  \ frameshifts between blocks)\n\n"
