help_text: "REF-EVAL-ESTIMATE-TRUE-ASSEMBLY: A program to estimate the \"true\" assembly\n\
  \        of a set of reads, relative to a set of reference sequences\n\nOverview\n\
  \n   This program constructs an estimate of the \"true\" assembly of a set\n   of\
  \ reads, relative to a set of reference sequences, based on\n   alignment information\
  \ produced by RSEM.\n\n   As defined by DETONATE [1], the \"true\" assembly of a\
  \ set of reads,\n   relative to the true transcript sequences that the reads were\n\
  \   generated from, is the set of contiguous subsequences of the\n   transcript\
  \ sequences that are covered by reads, with the reads\n   overlapping by at least\
  \ --min-overlap bases, when each read is\n   aligned to its true location of origin.\n\
  \n   In practice, we do not know the reads' true locations of origin; in\n   fact,\
  \ we do not even know (precisely) the true transcript sequences\n   that the reads\
  \ were generated from. Instead, we start with a set of\n   reference sequences (e.g.,\
  \ an Ensembl reference), and we align each\n   read to these reference sequences\
  \ using RSEM/Bowtie. The current\n   program chooses a subset of these alignments,\
  \ according to a policy\n   specified by --alignment-policy and --min-alignment-prob,\
  \ and then\n   builds our best guess as to the \"true\" assembly based on these\n\
  \   alignments.\n\n   [1] Bo Li*, Nathanael Fillmore*, Yongsheng Bai, Mike Collins,\
  \ James\n   A. Thompson, Ron Stewart, Colin N. Dewey. Evaluation of de novo\n  \
  \ transcriptome assemblies from RNA-Seq data.\n\nExample usage\n\n   First, use\
  \ a recent version of RSEM to quantify the expression of the\n   full-length transcripts\
  \ relative to the reads. For example:\n\n $ rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.ensembl63.filtered.gtf\
  \ mm9.fa ref\n $ rsem-calculate-expression --num-threads 24 reads.fq ref expr\n\n\
  \   Second, use this program to estimate the \"true\" assembly:\n\n $ ./ref-eval-estimate-true-assembly\
  \ --reference ref --expression expr --assembly cc\n\n   This will output a file,\
  \ cc_0.fa, that contains the \"true\" assembly.\n\nGeneral options\n\n   -? [ --help\
