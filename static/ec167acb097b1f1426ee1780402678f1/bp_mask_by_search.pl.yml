help_text: "NAME\n    bp_mask_by_search - mask sequence(s) based on its alignment\
  \ results\n\nSYNOPSIS\n      bp_mask_by_search.pl -f blast genomefile blastfile.bls\
  \ > maskedgenome.fa\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    Mask sequence based on significant alignments\
  \ of another sequence. You\n    need to provide the report file and the entire sequence\
  \ data which you\n    want to mask. By default this will assume you have done a\
  \ TBLASTN (or\n    TFASTY) and try and mask the hit sequence assuming you've provided\
  \ the\n    sequence file for the hit database. If you would like to do the reverse\n\
  \    and mask the query sequence specify the -t/--type query flag.\n\n    This is\
  \ going to read in the whole sequence file into memory so for\n    large genomes\
  \ this may fall over. I'm using DB_File to prevent keeping\n    everything in memory,\
  \ one solution is to split the genome into pieces\n    (BEFORE you run the DB search\
  \ though, you want to use the exact file you\n    BLASTed with as input to this\
  \ program).\n\n    Below the double dash (--) options are of the form --format=fasta\
  \ or\n    --format fasta or you can just say -f fasta\n\n    By -f/--format I mean\
  \ either are acceptable options. The =s or =n or =c\n    specify these arguments\
  \ expect a 'string'\n\n    Options: -f/--format=s Search report format (fasta,blast,axt,hmmer,etc)\n\
  \    -sf/--sformat=s Sequence format (fasta,genbank,embl,swissprot)\n    --hardmask\
  \ (booelean) Hard mask the sequence with the maskchar [default\n    is lowercase\
  \ mask] --maskchar=c Character to mask with [default is N],\n    change to 'X' for\
  \ protein sequences -e/--evalue=n Evalue cutoff for HSPs\n    and Hits, only mask\
  \ sequence if alignment has specified evalue or better\n    -o/--out/ --outfile=file\
  \ Output file to save the masked sequence to.\n    -t/--type=s Alignment seq type\
  \ you want to mask, the 'hit' or the\n    'query' sequence. [default is 'hit'] --minlen=n\
  \ Minimum length of an HSP\n    for it to be used in masking [default 0] -h/--help\
  \ See this help\n    information\n\nAUTHOR - Jason Stajich\n    Jason Stajich, jason-at-bioperl-dot-org.\n\
