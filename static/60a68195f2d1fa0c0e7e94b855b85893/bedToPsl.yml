  usage:\n   bedToPsl chromSizes bedFile pslFile\n\nConvert a BED file to a PSL file.\
  \ This the result is an alignment.\n It is intended to allow processing by tools\
  \ that operate on PSL.\nIf the BED has at least 12 columns, then a PSL with blocks\
  \ is created.\nOtherwise single-exon PSLs are created.\n\nOptions:\n-keepQuery \
  \ -  instead of creating a fake query, create PSL with identical query and\n   \
  \             target specs. Useful if bed features are to be lifted with pslMap\
  \ and one \n                wants to keep the source location in the lift result.\n\
