help_text: "\nVersion: 2.3\n\nUsage:\n\n  mash taxscreen [options] <queries>.msh <pool>\
  \ [<pool>] ...\n\nDescription:\n\n  Create Kraken-style taxonomic report based on\
  \ how well query sequences are contained within a pool of sequences. The queries\
  \ must be formatted as a single Mash sketch file (.msh), created with the `mash\
  \ sketch` command. The <pool> files can be contigs or reads, in fasta or fastq,\
  \ gzipped or not, and \"-\" can be given for <pool> to read from standard input.\
  \ The <pool> sequences are assumed to be nucleotides, and will be 6-frame translated\
  \ if the <queries> are amino acids. The output fields are [total percent of hashes,\
  \ number of contained hashes in the clade, number of contained hashes in the taxon,\
  \ total number of hashes in the clade, total number of hashes in the taxon, rank,\
  \ taxonomy ID, padded name].\n\nOptions:\n\n  Option     Description (range) [default]\n\
