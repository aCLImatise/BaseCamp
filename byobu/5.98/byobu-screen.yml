  \ - wrapper script for seeding a user's byobu configuration and launching a text\
  \ based window manager (either screen or tmux)\n\nSYNOPSIS\n       byobu [options]\n\
  \n       byobu-screen [screen options]\n\n       byobu-tmux [tmux options]\n\n \
  \      Options to byobu are simply passed through screen(1) or tmux(1).\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\
  \       byobu  is a script that launches a text based window manager (either screen(1)\
  \ or tmux(1)) in the byobu configuration.  This enables the display of system information\
  \ and status notifications within\n       two lines at the bottom of the screen\
  \ session. It also enables multiple tabbed terminal sessions, accessible through\
  \ simple keystrokes.\n\n       byobu currently defaults to using tmux(1) (if present)\
  \ as the backend, however, this can be overridden with the byobu-select-backend(1)\
  \ utility.\n\n       Note that BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR=$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/byobu if defined,\
  \ and $HOME/.byobu otherwise.\n\nBACKGROUND COLORS\n       The background colors\
  \ of the byobu status lines can be adjusted by editing the files $HOME/.byobu/color\
  \ (for byobu-screen) and $HOME/.byobu/color.tmux (for byobu-tmux).   The  command\
  \  Ctrl-Shift-F5\n       will change the background to a randomly selected color\
  \ when running in byobu-tmux mode.  Simply remove those files to return to the default\
  \ color configuration.\n\nSTATUS NOTIFICATIONS\n       byobu  supports  a number\
  \ of unique and interesting status notifications across the lowest two lines in\
  \ the screen.  Each status notification item is independently configurable, enabled\
  \ and disabled\n       by the configuration utility.  The guide below helps identify\
  \ each status item (in alphabetical order):\n\n       apport - symbol displayed\
  \ if there are pending crash reports; {!} symbol displayed on the lower bar toward\
  \ the left, in black on an orange background\n\n       arch - system architecture;\
  \ displayed on the lower bar toward the left, in the default text color on the default\
  \ background color\n\n       battery - battery information; display on the lower\
  \ bar toward the right; - indicates discharging, + indicates charging, = indicates\
  \ fully charged;  when charging or discharging, the current battery\n       capacity\
  \  as  a  percentage is displayed;  the colours green, yellow, and red are used\
  \ to give further indication of the battery's charge state; you may override the\
  \ detected battery by setting BAT窶申n       TERY=/proc/acpi/battery/BAT0 in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\n\
  \n       cpu_count - the number of cpu's or cores on the system; displayed in the\
  \ lower bar toward the right in the default text color on the default background,\
  \ followed by a trailing 'x'\n\n       cpu_freq - the current frequency of the cpu\
  \ in GHz; displayed in the lower bar toward the right in white text on a light blue\
  \ background\n\n       cpu_temp - the cpu temperature in Celsius (default) or Fahrenheit,\
  \ configure TEMP=F or TEMP=C in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc; displayed in the lower\
  \ bar toward the right in yellow  text  on  a  black\n       background; you may\
  \ override the detected cpu temperature device by setting MONITORED_TEMP=/proc/acpi/whatever\
  \ in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\n\n       custom - user defined custom scripts;\
  \ must be executable programs of any kind in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/bin; must be named\
  \ N_NAME, where N is the frequency in seconds to refresh the status indicator, and\n\
  \       NAME is the name of the script; N should not be less than 5 seconds; the\
  \ script should echo a small amount of text to standard out, standard error is discarded;\
  \ the indicator will  be  displayed  in\n       the  lower  panel,  in default colors,\
  \ unless you manually specify the colors in your script's output; BEWARE, cpu-intensive\
  \ custom scripts may impact your overall system performance and could upset\n  \
  \     your system administrator!  In fact, you can easily copy and modify any status\
  \ script usually found in /usr/lib/byobu/* to your local $HOME/.byobu/ directory.\n\
  \         Example: $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/bin/1000_uname\n           #!/bin/sh\n    \
  \       printf \"\\005{= bw}%s\\005{-}\" \"$(uname -r)\"\n\n       date - the system\

  \ in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc\n\nSESSIONS\n       Byobu name screen sessions \"\
  byobu\", if unspecified.  To hide sessions from byobu-select-session(1), prepend\
  \ a \".\" to the beginning of the session name, like:\n\n        byobu -S .hidden\n\
  \nWINDOWS\n       Each open window in the screen session is displayed in the upper\
  \ bar toward the far left.  These are numbered, and include indicators as to activity\
  \ in the window (see \"activity\"  in  screen(1)  and\n       tmux(1) for symbol\
  \ definitions).  The current active window is highlighted by inverting the background/text\
  \ from the rest of the window bar.\n\n       Users  can create a list of windows\
  \ to launch at startup in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows and $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.tmux.\
  \  This file is the same syntax as ~/.screenrc and ~/.tmuxrc, each line speci窶申n\
  \       fying a window, as described in screen(1) or tmux(1).\n\n       User can\
  \ also launch Byobu with unique window sets.  Users can store these as $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.[NAME]\
  \ and $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.tmux.[NAME], and launch Byobu with the environment\
  \  vari窶申n       able BYOBU_WINDOWS=NAME.\n\n       For example:\n         $ cat\
  \ $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.ssh_sessions\n         screen -t localhost bash\n  \
  \       screen -t aussie ssh root@aussie\n         screen -t beagle ssh root@beagle\n\
  \         screen -t collie ssh root@collie\n         $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=ssh_sessions\
  \ byobu\n\n       For example:\n         $ cat $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/windows.tmux.split4\n\
  \         new-session 'bash' ;\n         split-window ;\n         split-window ;\n\
  \         split-window ;\n         select-layout tiled ;\n         select-pane -t\
  \ 0\n         $ BYOBU_WINDOWS=split4 byobu\n\nUNITS OF MEASURE\n       byobu uses\
  \ binary for capacity measurements of KB, MB, GB, and TB.  This means multiples\
  \ of 1024 rather than multiples of 1000, in accordance with JEDEC Standard 100B.01\
  \ for disk and memory capacity\n       measurements.  See:\n        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JEDEC_memory_standards\n\
  \n       byobu uses decimal for measurements of network data transfer, meaning multiple\
  \ of 1000, rather than 1024.  See:\n        * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_rate_units\n\
  \nKEYBINDINGS\n       byobu keybindings can be user defined in /usr/share/byobu/keybindings/\
  \ (or within .screenrc if byobu-export was used). The common key bindings are:\n\
  \n       F2 - Create a new window\n\n       F3 - Move to previous window\n\n   \
  \    F4 - Move to next window\n\n       F5 - Reload profile\n\n       F6 - Detach\
  \ from this session\n\n       F7 - Enter copy/scrollback mode\n\n       F8 - Re-title\
  \ a window\n\n       F9 - Configuration Menu\n\n       F12 -  Lock this terminal\n\
  \n       shift-F2 - Split the screen horizontally\n\n       ctrl-F2 - Split the\
  \ screen vertically\n\n       shift-F3 - Shift the focus to the previous split region\n\
  \n       shift-F4 - Shift the focus to the next split region\n\n       shift-F5\
  \ - Join all splits\n\n       ctrl-F6 - Remove this split\n\n       ctrl-F5 - Reconnect\
  \ GPG and SSH sockets\n\n       shift-F6 - Detach, but do not logout\n\n       alt-pgup\
  \ - Enter scrollback mode\n\n       alt-pgdn - Enter scrollback mode\n\n       Ctrl-a\
  \ $ - show detailed status\n\n       Ctrl-a R - Reload profile\n\n       Ctrl-a\
  \ ! - Toggle key bindings on and off\n\n       Ctrl-a k - Kill the current window\n\
  \n       Ctrl-a ~ - Save the current window's scrollback buffer\n\nSCROLLBACK, COPY,\
  \ PASTE MODES\n       Each window in Byobu has up to 10,000 lines of scrollback\
  \ history, which you can enter and navigate using the alt-pgup and alt-pgdn keys.\
  \  Exit this scrollback mode by hitting enter.  You  can  also\n       easily copy\
  \ and paste text from scrollback mode.  To do so, enter scrollback using alt-pgup\
  \ or alt-pgdn, press the spacebar to start highlighting text, use up/down/left/right/pgup/pgdn\
  \ to select the\n       text, and press enter to copy the text.  You can then paste\
  \ the text using alt-insert or ctrl-a-].\n\nBUGS\n       For Byobu colors to work\
  \ properly, older versions of GNU Screen require a 1-line patch to adjust MAX_WINMSG_REND\
  \ in screen.c.  The change is in GNU Screen's upstream  source  control  system\
  \  as  of\n       2010-01-26,  but  GNU  Screen has not released a new upstream\
  \ version in several years.  You can disable colors entirely by setting MONOCHROME=1\
  \ in $BYOBU_CONFIG_DIR/statusrc.  For more information,\n       see:\n        *\
  \ http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?22146\n\n       PuTTY users have reported that the\
  \ F2, F3, and F4 shortcut keys are not working properly.  PuTTY sends the same escape\
  \ sequences as the linux console for F1-F4 by default.  You can fix this  problem\n\
  \       in the PuTTY config, Terminal -> Keyboard -> Function keys: Xterm R6.  See:\
  \ http://www.mail-archive.com/screen-users@gnu.org/msg01525.html\n\n       PuTTY\
  \ users should configure enable UTF-8 characters in order to fix status refresh\
  \ issues.  You can fix this problem in the PuTTY configuration, Window -> Translation:\
  \ select UTF-8.\n\n       PuTTY users should avoid resizing their window to one\
  \ character tall, as this can sometimes crash byobu-screen.\n\n       Apple Mac\
  \ OSX terminal users have reported 'flashing text'.  You can fix this in the advanced\
  \ settings of the terminal application, with 'Declare Terminal As: xterm-color'.\n\
  \n       Apple Mac keyboard users may need to specify a vt100 terminal by adding\
  \ this to your OSX profile, in order to get Byobu's function keys and colors to\
  \ work:\n         alias ssh='TERM=vt100 ssh'\n\n       Users of a non-UTF-8 locale\
  \ (such as cs_CZ charset ISO-8859-2), may need to add \"defutf8 off\" to ~/.screenrc,\
  \ if some characters are rendering as \"?\".\n\n       Users who customize their\
  \ PS1 prompt need to put this setting in ~/.bashrc, rather than ~/.profile, in order\
  \ for it to work correctly with Byobu.\n\n       If  you  run byobu(1) under sudo(8),\
  \ you must use the -H option, such that the user's $HOME directory environment variable\
  \ is set properly.  Otherwise, byobu(1) will create a bunch of directories in\n\
  \       the $SUDO_USER's $HOME, but will be owned by root.  To prevent this from\
  \ happening, byobu(1) will simply refuse to run if $USER does not own $HOME.\n\n\
  \       Byobu requires a suitable ulimit(3) values to run.  If you get an error\
  \ at startup saying, 'pipe: too many open files', then check your ulimit -a values,\
  \ as your \"open files\" or \"max user processes\"\n       are too low.  In this\
  \ case, you will probably need to run simple screen(1)\n\nSEE ALSO\n       screen(1),\
