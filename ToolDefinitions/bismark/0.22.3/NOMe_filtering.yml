help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\n  This script reads in methylation call files from the\
  \ Bismark methylation extract that contain additional information about the reads\
  \ that \n  methylation calls belonged to. It processes entire (single-end) reads\
  \ and then filters calls for NOMe-Seq positions (nucleosome occupancy\n  and methylome\
  \ sequencing) where accessible DNA gets methylated in a GpC context:\n \n     (i)\
  \ filters CpGs to only output cytosines in A-CG and T-CG context\n    (ii) filters\
  \ GC context to only report cytosines in GC-A, GC-C and GC-T context\n\n  Both of\
  \ these measures aim to reduce unwanted biases, i.e. the influence of G-CG (intended)\
  \ and C-CG (off-target) on endogenous CpG\n  methylation, and the influence of CpG\
  \ methylation on (the NOMe-Seq specific) GC context methylation.\n\n  The input\
  \ file needs to have been generated with bismark_methylation_extractor with the\
  \ option '--yacht' specified and be in the following format:\n  \n  <seq-ID>  <methylation\
  \ state*>  <chromosome>  <start position (= end position)>  <methylation call> \
  \ <read start>  <read end>  <read orientation>\n\n  *   Methylated cytosines receive\
  \ a '+' orientation,\n  * Unmethylated cytosines receive a '-' orientation.\n\n\n\
  \  USAGE: NOMe_filtering --genome_folder <path> [input]\n\n\n  The name of the output\
  \ file is rerived from the input file, end will end in '.manOwar.txt.gz'\n\n  --genome_folder\
  \ <path>   Enter the genome folder you wish to use to extract sequences from (full\
  \ path only!). Accepted\n                           formats are FastA files ending\
  \ with '.fa' or '.fasta'. Specifying a genome folder path is mandatory.\n\n\n  --help\
  \                   Displays this help message and exits\n\n\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\n\
  \nThe NOMe-Seq filtering output reports cytosines in CpG context only if they are\
  \ in A-CG or T-CG context,\nand cytosines in GC context only when the C is not in\
  \ CpG context. The output file is tab-delimited and in\nthe following format (1-based\
  \ coords):\n===========================================================================================================\n\
