help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\n  This script generates a cytosine methylation report\
  \ for a genome of interest and a sorted methylation input file produced\n  by the\
  \ script bismark2bedGraph or the bismark_methylation_extractor when '--bedGraph'\
  \ was specified. The input files\n  (.cov or .cov.gz) are expected to use 1-based\
  \ genomic coordinates. By default, the output uses 1-based chromosomal coordinates\n\
  \  and reports CpG positions only (for both strands individually and not merged\
  \ in any way). Output coordinates may be changed\n  to 0-based coordinates using\
  \ the option '--zero_based'.\n\n  The input file needs to have been generated with\
  \ the script bismark2bedGraph (the file is called *.cov, or .cov.gz) or\n  otherwise\
  \ be sorted by position and exactly in the following format:\n\n  <chromosome> \
  \ <start position>  <end position>  <methylation percentage>  <count methylated>\
  \  <count unmethylated>\n\n  The coordinates of the input file are expected to be\
  \ 1-based throughout (do not use files ending in .zero.cov!).\n\n\n  USAGE: coverage2cytosine\

  \ <path>   Enter the genome folder you wish to use to extract sequences from (relative\
  \ or full path). Accepted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t formats are FastA files ending with '.fa'\
  \ or '.fasta'. Specifying a genome folder path is mandatory.\n\n-CX/--CX_context\
  \         The output file contains information on every single cytosine in the genome\
  \ irrespective of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t its context. This applies to both forward and reverse\
  \ strands. Please be aware that this will\n\t\t\t\t\t\t generate output files with\
  \ > 1.1 billion lines for a mammalian genome such as human or mouse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\
  \t Default: OFF (i.e. Default = CpG context only).\n\n--merge_CpG              Using\
  \ this option will post-process the genome-wide report to write out an additional\
  \ coverage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t file (see above for the coverage file format) which has\
  \ the top and bottom strand methylation\n\t\t\t\t\t\t evidence pooled into a single\
  \ CpG dinucleotide entity. This may be the desirable input format\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\
  \ for some downstream processing tools such as the R-package bsseq (by K.D. Hansen).\
  \ An example would be:\n\n\t\t\t   genome-wide CpG report (old)\n\t\t\t   gi|9626372|ref|NC_001422.1|\
  \     157     +       313     156     CG\n\t\t\t   gi|9626372|ref|NC_001422.1| \

  \   648     312\n\n\t\t\t This option is currently experimental, and only works\
  \ if CpG context only and a single genome-wide report\n\t\t\t\t\t\t were specified\
  \ (i.e. it doesn't work with the options --CX or --split_by_chromosome).\n\t\t\t\
  \t\t\t If --zero_based was specified as well the output coverage file is in zero-based\
  \ half-open format like\n\t\t\t\t\t\t bedGraph files.\n\n--discordance <int>   \
