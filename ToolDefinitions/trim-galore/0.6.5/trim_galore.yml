  \ from reads in addition to adapter removal. For\n                        RRBS samples,\
  \ quality trimming will be performed first, and adapter\n                      \
  \  trimming is carried in a second round. Other files are quality and adapter\n\
  \                        trimmed in a single pass. The algorithm is the same as\
  \ the one used by BWA\n                        (Subtract INT from all qualities;\
  \ compute partial sums from all indices\n                        to the end of the\
  \ sequence; cut sequence at the index at which the sum is\n                    \
  \    minimal). Default Phred score: 20.\n\n--phred33               Instructs Cutadapt\
  \ to use ASCII+33 quality scores as Phred scores\n                        (Sanger/Illumina\
  \ 1.9+ encoding) for quality trimming. Default: ON.\n\n--phred64               Instructs\
  \ Cutadapt to use ASCII+64 quality scores as Phred scores\n                    \
  \    (Illumina 1.5 encoding) for quality trimming.\n\n--fastqc                Run\
  \ FastQC in the default mode on the FastQ file once trimming is complete.\n\n--fastqc_args\
  \ \"<ARGS>\"  Passes extra arguments to FastQC. If more than one argument is to\
  \ be passed\n                        to FastQC they must be in the form \"arg1 arg2\
  \ etc.\". An example would be:\n                        --fastqc_args \"--nogroup\
  \ --outdir /home/\". Passing extra arguments will\n                        automatically\
  \ invoke FastQC, so --fastqc does not have to be specified\n                   \
  \     separately.\n\n-a/--adapter <STRING>   Adapter sequence to be trimmed. If\
  \ not specified explicitly, Trim Galore will\n                        try to auto-detect\
  \ whether the Illumina universal, Nextera transposase or Illumina\n            \
  \            small RNA adapter sequence was used. Also see '--illumina', '--nextera'\
  \ and\n                        '--small_rna'. If no adapter can be detected within\
  \ the first 1 million sequences\n                        of the first file specified\
  \ or if there is a tie between several adapter sequences,\n                    \
  \    Trim Galore defaults to '--illumina' (as long as the Illumina adapter was one\
  \ of the\n                        options, else '--nextera' is the default). A single\
  \ base\n                        may also be given as e.g. -a A{10}, to be expanded\
  \ to -a AAAAAAAAAA.\n\n-a2/--adapter2 <STRING> Optional adapter sequence to be trimmed\
  \ off read 2 of paired-end files. This\n                        option requires\
  \ '--paired' to be specified as well. If the libraries to be trimmed\n         \
  \               are smallRNA then a2 will be set to the Illumina small RNA 5' adapter\
  \ automatically\n                        (GATCGTCGGACT). A single base may also\
  \ be given as e.g. -a2 A{10}, to be expanded\n                        to -a2 AAAAAAAAAA.\n\
  \n--illumina              Adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 13bp of the\
  \ Illumina universal adapter\n                        'AGATCGGAAGAGC' instead of\
  \ the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.\n\n--nextera               Adapter\
  \ sequence to be trimmed is the first 12bp of the Nextera adapter\n            \
  \            'CTGTCTCTTATA' instead of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence.\n\
  \n--small_rna             Adapter sequence to be trimmed is the first 12bp of the\
  \ Illumina Small RNA 3' Adapter\n                        'TGGAATTCTCGG' instead\
  \ of the default auto-detection of adapter sequence. Selecting\n               \
  \         to trim smallRNA adapters will also lower the --length value to 18bp.\
  \ If the smallRNA\n                        libraries are paired-end then a2 will\
  \ be set to the Illumina small RNA 5' adapter\n                        automatically\
  \ (GATCGTCGGACT) unless -a 2 had been defined explicitly.\n\n--consider_already_trimmed\
  \ <INT>     During adapter auto-detection, the limit set by <INT> allows the user\
  \ to \n                        set a threshold up to which the file is considered\
  \ already adapter-trimmed. If no adapter\n                        sequence exceeds\
  \ this threshold, no additional adapter trimming will be performed (technically,\n\
  \                        the adapter is set to '-a X'). Quality trimming is still\
  \ performed as usual.\n                        Default: NOT SELECTED (i.e. normal\
  \ auto-detection precedence rules apply).                     \n\n--max_length <INT>\
  \      Discard reads that are longer than <INT> bp after trimming. This is only\
  \ advised for\n                        smallRNA sequencing to remove non-small RNA\
  \ sequences.\n\n\n--stringency <INT>      Overlap with adapter sequence required\
  \ to trim a sequence. Defaults to a\n                        very stringent setting\
  \ of 1, i.e. even a single bp of overlapping sequence\n                        will\
  \ be trimmed off from the 3' end of any read.\n\n-e <ERROR RATE>         Maximum\
  \ allowed error rate (no. of errors divided by the length of the matching\n    \
  \                    region) (default: 0.1)\n\n--gzip                  Compress\
  \ the output file with GZIP. If the input files are GZIP-compressed\n          \
  \              the output files will automatically be GZIP compressed as well. As\
  \ of v0.2.8 the\n                        compression will take place on the fly.\n\
  \n--dont_gzip             Output files won't be compressed with GZIP. This option\
  \ overrides --gzip.\n\n--length <INT>          Discard reads that became shorter\
  \ than length INT because of either\n                        quality or adapter\
  \ trimming. A value of '0' effectively disables\n                        this behaviour.\
  \ Default: 20 bp.\n\n                        For paired-end files, both reads of\
  \ a read-pair need to be longer than\n                        <INT> bp to be printed\
  \ out to validated paired-end files (see option --paired).\n                   \
  \     If only one read became too short there is the possibility of keeping such\n\
  \                        unpaired single-end reads (see --retain_unpaired). Default\
  \ pair-cutoff: 20 bp.\n\n--max_n COUNT           The total number of Ns (as integer)\
  \ a read may contain before it will be removed altogether.\n                   \
  \     In a paired-end setting, either read exceeding this limit will result in the\
  \ entire\n                        pair being removed from the trimmed output files.\n\
  \n--trim-n                Removes Ns from either side of the read. This option does\
  \ currently not work in RRBS mode.\n\n-o/--output_dir <DIR>   If specified all output\
  \ will be written to this directory instead of the current\n                   \
  \     directory. If the directory doesn't exist it will be created for you.\n\n\
  --no_report_file        If specified no report file will be generated.\n\n--suppress_warn\
  \         If specified any output to STDOUT or STDERR will be suppressed.\n\n--clip_R1\
  \ <int>         Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 5' end of read\
  \ 1 (or single-end\n                        reads). This may be useful if the qualities\
  \ were very poor, or if there is some\n                        sort of unwanted\
  \ bias at the 5' end. Default: OFF.\n\n--clip_R2 <int>         Instructs Trim Galore\
  \ to remove <int> bp from the 5' end of read 2 (paired-end reads\n             \
  \           only). This may be useful if the qualities were very poor, or if there\
  \ is some sort\n                        of unwanted bias at the 5' end. For paired-end\
  \ BS-Seq, it is recommended to remove\n                        the first few bp\
  \ because the end-repair reaction may introduce a bias towards low\n           \
  \             methylation. Please refer to the M-bias plot section in the Bismark\
  \ User Guide for\n                        some examples. Default: OFF.\n\n--three_prime_clip_R1\
  \ <int>     Instructs Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 3' end of read 1 (or\
  \ single-end\n                        reads) AFTER adapter/quality trimming has\
  \ been performed. This may remove some unwanted\n                        bias from\
  \ the 3' end that is not directly related to adapter sequence or basecall quality.\n\
  \                        Default: OFF.\n\n--three_prime_clip_R2 <int>     Instructs\
  \ Trim Galore to remove <int> bp from the 3' end of read 2 AFTER\n             \
  \           adapter/quality trimming has been performed. This may remove some unwanted\
  \ bias from\n                        the 3' end that is not directly related to\
  \ adapter sequence or basecall quality.\n                        Default: OFF.\n\
  \n--2colour/--nextseq INT This enables the option '--nextseq-trim=3'CUTOFF' within\
  \ Cutadapt, which will set a quality\n                        cutoff (that is normally\
  \ given with -q instead), but qualities of G bases are ignored.\n              \
  \          This trimming is in common for the NextSeq- and NovaSeq-platforms, where\
  \ basecalls without\n                        any signal are called as high-quality\
  \ G bases. This is mutually exlusive with '-q INT'.\n\n\n--path_to_cutadapt </path/to/cutadapt>\
  \     You may use this option to specify a path to the Cutadapt executable,\n  \
  \                      e.g. /my/home/cutadapt-1.7.1/bin/cutadapt. Else it is assumed\
  \ that Cutadapt is in\n                        the PATH.\n\n--basename <PREFERRED_NAME>\t\
  Use PREFERRED_NAME as the basename for output files, instead of deriving the filenames\
  \ from\n                        the input files. Single-end data would be called\
  \ PREFERRED_NAME_trimmed.fq(.gz), or\n                        PREFERRED_NAME_val_1.fq(.gz)\
  \ and PREFERRED_NAME_val_2.fq(.gz) for paired-end data. --basename\n           \
  \             only works when 1 file (single-end) or 2 files (paired-end) are specified,\
  \ but not for longer lists.\n\n-j/--cores INT          Number of cores to be used\
  \ for trimming [default: 1]. For Cutadapt to work with multiple cores, it\n    \
  \                    requires Python 3 as well as parallel gzip (pigz) installed\
  \ on the system. The version of Python used \n                        is detected\
  \ from the shebang line of the Cutadapt executable (either 'cutadapt', or a specified\
  \ path).\n                        If Python 2 is detected, --cores is set to 1.\n\
  \                        If pigz cannot be detected on your system, Trim Galore\
  \ reverts to using gzip compression. Please note\n                        that gzip\
  \ compression will slow down multi-core processes so much that it is hardly worthwhile,\
  \ please \n                        see: https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/issues/16#issuecomment-458557103\
  \ for more info).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                        Actual core usage: It should\
  \ be mentioned that the actual number of cores used is a little convoluted.\n  \
  \                      Assuming that Python 3 is used and pigz is installed, --cores\
  \ 2 would use 2 cores to read the input\n                        (probably not at\
  \ a high usage though), 2 cores to write to the output (at moderately high usage),\
  \ and \n                        2 cores for Cutadapt itself + 2 additional cores\
  \ for Cutadapt (not sure what they are used for) + 1 core\n                    \
  \    for Trim Galore itself. So this can be up to 9 cores, even though most of them\
  \ won't be used at 100% for\n                        most of the time. Paired-end\
  \ processing uses twice as many cores for the validation (= writing out) step.\n\
  \                        --cores 4 would then be: 4 (read) + 4 (write) + 4 (Cutadapt)\
  \ + 2 (extra Cutadapt) +\t1 (Trim Galore) = 15.\n\n                        It seems\
  \ that --cores 4 could be a sweet spot, anything above has diminishing returns.\n\
  \t\t\t\n\n\nSPECIFIC TRIMMING - without adapter/quality trimming\n\n--hardtrim5\
  \ <int>       Instead of performing adapter-/quality trimming, this option will\
  \ simply hard-trim sequences\n                        to <int> bp at the 5'-end.\
  \ Once hard-trimming of files is complete, Trim Galore will exit.\n            \
  \            Hard-trimmed output files will end in .<int>_5prime.fq(.gz). Here is\
  \ an example:\n\n                        before:         CCTAAGGAAACAAGTACACTCCACACATGCATAAAGGAAATCAAATGTTATTTTTAAGAAAATGGAAAAT\n\
  \                        --hardtrim5 20: CCTAAGGAAACAAGTACACT\n\n--hardtrim3 <int>\
  \       Instead of performing adapter-/quality trimming, this option will simply\
  \ hard-trim sequences\n                        to <int> bp at the 3'-end. Once hard-trimming\
  \ of files is complete, Trim Galore will exit.\n                        Hard-trimmed\
  \ output files will end in .<int>_3prime.fq(.gz). Here is an example:\n\n      \

  \            TTTTTAAGAAAATGGAAAAT\n\n--clock                 In this mode, reads\
  \ are trimmed in a specific way that is currently used for the Mouse\n         \
  \               Epigenetic Clock (see here: Multi-tissue DNA methylation age predictor\
  \ in mouse, Stubbs et al.,\n                        Genome Biology, 2017 18:68 https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-017-1203-5).\
  \ Following this, Trim Galore\n                        will exit.\n\n          \
  \              In it's current implementation, the dual-UMI RRBS reads come in the\
  \ following format:\n\n                        Read 1  5' UUUUUUUU CAGTA FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\
  \ TACTG UUUUUUUU 3'\n                        Read 2  3' UUUUUUUU GTCAT FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\
  \ ATGAC UUUUUUUU 5'\n\n                        Where UUUUUUUU is a random 8-mer\
  \ unique molecular identifier (UMI), CAGTA is a constant region,\n             \
  \           and FFFFFFF... is the actual RRBS-Fragment to be sequenced. The UMIs\
  \ for Read 1 (R1) and\n                        Read 2 (R2), as well as the fixed\
  \ sequences (F1 or F2), are written into the read ID and\n                     \
  \   removed from the actual sequence. Here is an example:\n\n                  \
  \      R1: @HWI-D00436:407:CCAETANXX:1:1101:4105:1905 1:N:0: CGATGTTT\n        \

  \n                        Following clock trimming, the resulting files (.clock_UMI.R1.fq(.gz)\
  \ and .clock_UMI.R2.fq(.gz))\n                        should be adapter- and quality\
  \ trimmed with Trim Galore as usual. In addition, reads need to be trimmed\n   \
  \                     by 15bp from their 3' end to get rid of potential UMI and\
  \ fixed sequences. The command is:\n\n                        trim_galore --paired\
  \ --three_prime_clip_R1 15 --three_prime_clip_R2 15 *.clock_UMI.R1.fq.gz *.clock_UMI.R2.fq.gz\n\
  \n                        Following this, reads should be aligned with Bismark and\
  \ deduplicated with UmiBam\n                        in '--dual_index' mode (see\
  \ here: https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Umi-Grinder). UmiBam recognises\n      \
  \                  the UMIs within this pattern: R1:(ATCTAGTT):R2:(CAATTTTG): as\
  \ (UMI R1) and (UMI R2).\n\n--polyA                 This is a new, still experimental,\
  \ trimming mode to identify and remove poly-A tails from sequences.\n          \
  \              When --polyA is selected, Trim Galore attempts to identify from the\
  \ first supplied sample whether\n                        sequences contain more\
  \ often a stretch of either 'AAAAAAAAAA' or 'TTTTTTTTTT'. This determines\n    \
  \                    if Read 1 of a paired-end end file, or single-end files, are\
  \ trimmed for PolyA or PolyT. In case of\n                        paired-end sequencing,\
  \ Read2 is trimmed for the complementary base from the start of the reads. The\n\
  \                        auto-detection uses a default of A{20} for Read1 (3'-end\
  \ trimming) and T{150} for Read2 (5'-end trimming).\n                        These\
  \ values may be changed manually using the options -a and -a2.\n\n             \
  \           In addition to trimming the sequences, white spaces are replaced with\
  \ _ and it records in the read ID\n                        how many bases were trimmed\
  \ so it can later be used to identify PolyA trimmed sequences. This is currently\
  \ done\n                        by writing tags to both the start (\"32:A:\") and\
  \ end (\"_PolyA:32\") of the reads in the following example:\n\n               \
  \         @READ-ID:1:1102:22039:36996 1:N:0:CCTAATCC\n                        GCCTAAGGAAACAAGTACACTCCACACATGCATAAAGGAAATCAAATGTTATTTTTAAGAAAATGGAAAATAAAAACTTTATAAACACCAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\
  \n                        @32:A:READ-ID:1:1102:22039:36996_1:N:0:CCTAATCC_PolyA:32\n\
  \                        GCCTAAGGAAACAAGTACACTCCACACATGCATAAAGGAAATCAAATGTTATTTTTAAGAAAATGGAAAATAAAAACTTTATAAACACC\n\
  \n                        PLEASE NOTE: The poly-A trimming mode expects that sequences\
  \ were both adapter and quality trimmed\n                        before looking\
  \ for Poly-A tails, and it is the user's responsibility to carry out an initial\
  \ round of\n                        trimming. The following sequence:\n \n     \
  \                   1) trim_galore file.fastq.gz\n                        2) trim_galore\
  \ --polyA file_trimmed.fq.gz\n                        3) zcat file_trimmed_trimmed.fq.gz\
  \ | grep -A 3 PolyA | grep -v ^-- > PolyA_trimmed.fastq\n\n                    \
  \    Will 1) trim qualities and Illumina adapter contamination, 2) find and remove\
  \ PolyA contamination.\n                        Finally, if desired, 3) will specifically\
  \ find PolyA trimmed sequences to a specific FastQ file of your choice.\n\n\nRRBS-specific\
  \ options (MspI digested material):\n\n--rrbs                  Specifies that the\
  \ input file was an MspI digested RRBS sample (recognition\n                   \
  \     site: CCGG). Single-end or Read 1 sequences (paired-end) which were adapter-trimmed\n\
  \                        will have a further 2 bp removed from their 3' end. Sequences\
  \ which were merely\n                        trimmed because of poor quality will\
  \ not be shortened further. Read 2 of paired-end\n                        libraries\
  \ will in addition have the first 2 bp removed from the 5' end (by setting\n   \
  \                     '--clip_r2 2'). This is to avoid using artificial methylation\
  \ calls from the filled-in\n                        cytosine positions close to\
  \ the 3' MspI site in sequenced fragments.\n                        This option\
  \ is not recommended for users of the NuGEN ovation RRBS System 1-16\n         \
  \               kit (see below).\n\n--non_directional       Selecting this option\
  \ for non-directional RRBS libraries will screen\n                        quality-trimmed\
  \ sequences for 'CAA' or 'CGA' at the start of the read\n                      \
  \  and, if found, removes the first two basepairs. Like with the option\n      \
  \                  '--rrbs' this avoids using cytosine positions that were filled-in\n\
  \                        during the end-repair step. '--non_directional' requires\
  \ '--rrbs' to\n                        be specified as well. Note that this option\
  \ does not set '--clip_r2 2' in\n                        paired-end mode.\n\n--keep\
  \                  Keep the quality trimmed intermediate file. Default: off, which\
  \ means\n                        the temporary file is being deleted after adapter\
  \ trimming. Only has\n                        an effect for RRBS samples since other\
  \ FastQ files are not trimmed\n                        for poor qualities separately.\n\
  \n\nNote for RRBS using the NuGEN Ovation RRBS System 1-16 kit:\n\nOwing to the\
  \ fact that the NuGEN Ovation kit attaches a varying number of nucleotides (0-3)\
  \ after each MspI\nsite Trim Galore should be run WITHOUT the option --rrbs. This\
  \ trimming is accomplished in a subsequent\ndiversity trimming step afterwards (see\
  \ their manual).\n\n\n\nNote for RRBS using MseI:\n\nIf your DNA material was digested\
  \ with MseI (recognition motif: TTAA) instead of MspI it is NOT necessary\nto specify\
  \ --rrbs or --non_directional since virtually all reads should start with the sequence\n\
  'TAA', and this holds true for both directional and non-directional libraries. As\
  \ the end-repair of 'TAA'\nrestricted sites does not involve any cytosines it does\
  \ not need to be treated especially. Instead, simply\nrun Trim Galore! in the standard\
  \ (i.e. non-RRBS) mode.\n\n\n\n\nPaired-end specific options:\n\n--paired      \
  \          This option performs length trimming of quality/adapter/RRBS trimmed\
  \ reads for\n                        paired-end files. To pass the validation test,\
  \ both sequences of a sequence pair\n                        are required to have\
  \ a certain minimum length which is governed by the option\n                   \
  \     --length (see above). If only one read passes this length threshold the\n\
  \                        other read can be rescued (see option --retain_unpaired).\
  \ Using this option lets\n                        you discard too short read pairs\
  \ without disturbing the sequence-by-sequence order\n                        of\
  \ FastQ files which is required by many aligners.\n\n                        Trim\
  \ Galore! expects paired-end files to be supplied in a pairwise fashion, e.g.\n\
  \                        file1_1.fq file1_2.fq SRR2_1.fq.gz SRR2_2.fq.gz ... .\n\
  \n-t/--trim1              Trims 1 bp off every read from its 3' end. This may be\
  \ needed for FastQ files that\n                        are to be aligned as paired-end\
  \ data with Bowtie. This is because Bowtie (1) regards\n                       \
  \ alignments like this:\n\n                          R1 --------------------------->\
  \     or this:    ----------------------->  R1\n                          R2 <---------------------------\
  \                       <-----------------  R2\n\n                        as invalid\
  \ (whenever a start/end coordinate is contained within the other read).\n      \
  \                  NOTE: If you are planning to use Bowtie2, BWA etc. you don't\
  \ need to specify this option.\n\n--retain_unpaired       If only one of the two\
  \ paired-end reads became too short, the longer\n                        read will\
  \ be written to either '.unpaired_1.fq' or '.unpaired_2.fq'\n                  \
  \      output files. The length cutoff for unpaired single-end reads is\n      \
  \                  governed by the parameters -r1/--length_1 and -r2/--length_2.\
  \ Default: OFF.\n\n-r1/--length_1 <INT>    Unpaired single-end read length cutoff\
  \ needed for read 1 to be written to\n                        '.unpaired_1.fq' output\
  \ file. These reads may be mapped in single-end mode.\n                        Default:\
  \ 35 bp.\n\n-r2/--length_2 <INT>    Unpaired single-end read length cutoff needed\
  \ for read 2 to be written to\n                        '.unpaired_2.fq' output file.\
  \ These reads may be mapped in single-end mode.\n                        Default:\
  \ 35 bp.\n\nLast modified on 07 November 2019.\n\n"
