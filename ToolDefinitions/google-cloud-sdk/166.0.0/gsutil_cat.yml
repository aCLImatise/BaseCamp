help_text: "NAME\n  cat - Concatenate object content to stdout\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\n \
  \ gsutil cat [-h] url...\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The cat command outputs the contents\
  \ of one or more URLs to stdout.\n  While the cat command does not compute a checksum,\
  \ it is otherwise\n  equivalent to doing:\n\n    gsutil cp url... -\n\n  (The final\
  \ '-' causes gsutil to stream the output to stdout.)\n\n\nWARNING: DATA INTEGRITY\
  \ CHECKING NOT DONE\n  The gsutil cat command does not compute a checksum of the\
  \ downloaded data.\n  Therefore, we recommend that users either perform their own\
  \ validation of the\n  output of gsutil cat or use gsutil cp or rsync (both of which\
  \ perform\n  integrity checking automatically).\n\n\nOPTIONS\n  -h          Prints\
  \ short header for each object. For example:\n\n                gsutil cat -h gs://bucket/meeting_notes/2012_Feb/*.txt\n\
  \n              This would print a header with the object name before the contents\n\
  \              of each text object that matched the wildcard.\n\n  -r range    Causes\
  \ gsutil to output just the specified byte range of the\n              object. Ranges\
  \ are can be of these forms:\n\n                start-end (e.g., -r 256-5939)\n\
  \                start-    (e.g., -r 256-)\n                -numbytes (e.g., -r\
  \ -5)\n\n              where offsets start at 0, start-end means to return bytes\
  \ start\n              through end (inclusive), start- means to return bytes start\n\
  \              through the end of the object, and -numbytes means to return the\n\
  \              last numbytes of the object. For example:\n\n                gsutil\
  \ cat -r 256-939 gs://bucket/object\n\n              returns bytes 256 through 939,\
  \ while:\n\n                gsutil cat -r -5 gs://bucket/object\n\n            \
  \  returns the final 5 bytes of the object.\n"
