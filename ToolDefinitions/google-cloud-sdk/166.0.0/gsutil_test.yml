help_text: "NAME\n  test - Run gsutil unit/integration tests (for developers)\n\n\n\
  SYNOPSIS\n\n  gsutil test [-l] [-u] [-f] [command command...]\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\
  \  The gsutil test command runs the gsutil unit tests and integration tests.\n \
  \ The unit tests use an in-memory mock storage service implementation, while\n \
  \ the integration tests send requests to the production service using the\n  preferred\
  \ API set in the boto configuration file (see \"gsutil help apis\" for\n  details).\n\
  \n  To run both the unit tests and integration tests, run the command with no\n\
  \  arguments:\n\n    gsutil test\n\n  To run the unit tests only (which run quickly):\n\
  \n    gsutil test -u\n\n  Tests run in parallel regardless of whether the top-level\
  \ -m flag is\n  present. To limit the number of tests run in parallel to 10 at a\
  \ time:\n\n    gsutil test -p 10\n\n  To force tests to run sequentially:\n\n  \
  \  gsutil test -p 1    \n\n  To have sequentially-run tests stop running immediately\
  \ when an error occurs:\n\n    gsutil test -f\n\n  To run tests for one or more\
  \ individual commands add those commands as\n  arguments. For example, the following\
  \ command will run the cp and mv command\n  tests:\n\n    gsutil test cp mv\n\n\
  \  To list available tests, run the test command with the -l argument:\n\n    gsutil\
  \ test -l\n\n  The tests are defined in the code under the gslib/tests module. Each\
  \ test\n  file is of the format test_[name].py where [name] is the test name you\
  \ can\n  pass to this command. For example, running \"gsutil test ls\" would run\
  \ the\n  tests in \"gslib/tests/test_ls.py\".\n\n  You can also run an individual\
  \ test class or function name by passing the\n  test module followed by the class\
  \ name and optionally a test name. For\n  example, to run the an entire test class\
  \ by name:\n\n    gsutil test naming.GsutilNamingTests\n\n  or an individual test\
  \ function:\n\n    gsutil test cp.TestCp.test_streaming\n\n  You can list the available\
  \ tests under a module or class by passing arguments\n  with the -l option. For\
  \ example, to list all available test functions in the\n  cp module:\n\n    gsutil\
  \ test -l cp\n\n  To output test coverage:\n\n    gsutil test -c -p 500\n    coverage\
  \ html\n\n  This will output an HTML report to a directory named 'htmlcov'.\n\n\
  \  Test coverage is compatible with v4.1 of the coverage module\n  (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage).\n\
  \n\nOPTIONS\n  -b          Run tests against multi-regional US buckets. By default,\n\
  \              tests run against regional buckets in us-central1.\n\n  -c      \
  \    Output coverage information.\n\n  -f          Exit on first sequential test\
  \ failure.\n\n  -l          List available tests.\n\n  -p N        Run at most N\
  \ tests in parallel. The default value is 5.\n\n  -s          Run tests against\
  \ S3 instead of GS.\n\n  -u          Only run unit tests.\n"
