  \n\n\nDESCRIPTION\n  The rb command deletes a bucket. Buckets must be empty before\
  \ you can delete\n  them.\n\n  Be certain you want to delete a bucket before you\
  \ do so, as once it is\n  deleted the name becomes available and another user may\
  \ create a bucket with\n  that name. (But see also \"DOMAIN NAMED BUCKETS\" under\
  \ \"gsutil help naming\"\n  for help carving out parts of the bucket name space.)\n\
  \n\nOPTIONS\n  -f          Continues silently (without printing error messages)\
  \ despite\n              errors when removing buckets. If some buckets couldn't\
  \ be removed,\n              gsutil's exit status will be non-zero even if this\
  \ flag is set.\n"
