help_text: "\n      SYNOPSIS:\n\n\tSNPsplit is designed to read in alignment files\
  \ in SAM/BAM format and determine the allelic origin of reads\n\tthat cover known\
  \ SNP positions. For this to work the alignment step must have been carried out\
  \ against a\n\tgenome that had all SNP positions replaced by Ns, and a list of SNP\
  \ positions between the two different genomes\n\thas to be provided using the option\
  \ --snp_file.\n\n\tSNPsplit operates in two stages:\n\n\tI) SNPsplit-tag: SNPsplit\
  \ analyses reads (single-end mode) or read pairs (paired-end mode) for overlaps\n\
  \        with known SNP positions, and writes out a tagged BAM file in the same\
  \ order as the original file.\n\n        II) SNPsplit-sort: the tagged BAM file\
  \ is read in and is being sorted into allele-specific files. This process\n    \
  \    may also be run as a stand-alone module (tag2sort).\n\n\n        The SNPsplit-tag\
  \ module determines whether a read can be assigned to a certain allele and appends\
  \ an additional\n        optional field 'XX:Z:' to each read. The tag can be one\
  \ of the following:\n\n        XX:Z:UA - Unassigned\n        XX:Z:G1 - Genome 1-specific\n\
  \        XX:Z:G2 - Genome 2-specific\n        XX:Z:CF - Conflicting\n\n\n      \
  \  The SNPsplit-sort module reads in the tagged BAM file and sorts the reads (or\
  \ read pairs) according to their XX:Z:\n        tag (or the combination of tags\
  \ for paired-end or Hi-C reads) into subfiles.\n\n\n      USAGE:      SNPsplit \
  \ [options] --snp_file <SNP.file.gz> [input file(s)]\n\n\n    input file(s)    \
  \      Mapping output file in SAM or BAM format. SAM files (ending in .sam) will\
  \ first be\n    converted to BAM using Samtools.\n\n    --snp_file <file>      Mandatory\
  \ file specifying SNP positions to be considered; may be a plain text file or\n\
  \                           gzip compressed. Currently, the SNP file is expected\
  \ to be in the following format:\n\n                                       SNP-ID\
  \     Chromosome  Position    Strand   Ref/SNP\n                           example:\
  \   33941939        9       68878541       1       T/G\n\n                     \
  \      Only the information contained in fields 'Chromosome', 'Position' and 'Reference/SNP\
  \ base'\n                           are being used for analysis. The genome referred\
  \ to as 'Ref' will be used as genome 1,\n                           the genome containing\
  \ the 'SNP' base as genome 2.\n\n    --paired               Paired-end mode. (Default:\
  \ OFF).\n\n    -o/--outdir <dir>      Write all output files into this directory.\
  \ By default the output files will be written into\n                           the\
  \ same folder as the input file(s). If the specified folder does not exist, SNPsplit\
  \ will attempt\n                           to create it first. The path to the output\
  \ folder can be either relative or absolute.\n\n    --singletons           If the\
  \ allele-tagged paired-end file also contains singleton alignments (which is the\n\
  \                           default for e.g. TopHat), these will be written out\
  \ to extra files (ending in _st.bam)\n                           instead of writing\
  \ everything to combined paired-end and singleton files. Default: OFF.\n\n    --no_sort\
  \              This option skips the sorting step if BAM files are already sorted\
  \ by read name (e.g.\n                           Hi-C files generated by HiCUP).\
  \ Please note that setting --no_sort for unsorted paired-end\n                 \
