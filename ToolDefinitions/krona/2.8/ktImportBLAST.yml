  \ Options \\___\n\n   [-o <string>]    Output file name. [Default: 'blast.krona.html']\n\
  \n   [-n <string>]    Name of the highest level. [Default: 'Root']\n\n   [-t <number>]\
  \    Threshold for bit score differences when determining\n                    \"\
  best\" hits. Hits with scores that are within this distance\n                  \
  \  of the highest score will be included when computing the\n                  \
  \  lowest common ancestor (or picking randomly if -r is\n                    specified).\
  \ [Default: '3']\n\n   [-i]             Include a wedge for queries with no hits.\n\
  \n   [-f]             If any best hits have unknown accessions, force\n        \
  \            classification to root instead of ignoring them.\n\n   [-r]       \
  \      Pick from the best hits randomly instead of finding the\n               \
  \     lowest common ancestor.\n\n   [-p]             Use percent identity for average\
  \ scores instead of log[10]\n                    e-value.\n\n   [-b]           \
  \  Use bit score for average scores instead of log[10]\n                    e-value.\n\
  \n   [-c]             Combine data from each file, rather than creating separate\n\
  \                    datasets within the chart.\n\n   [-d <integer>]   Maximum depth\
  \ of wedges to include in the chart.\n\n   [-k]             Show the \"cellular\
  \ organisms\" taxon (collapsed by\n                    default).\n\n   [-K]    \
  \         Collapse assignments to taxa with ranks labeled \"no rank\"\n        \
  \            by moving up to parent.\n\n   [-x <integer>]   Hue (0-360) for \"bad\"\
  \ scores. [Default: '0']\n\n   [-y <integer>]   Hue (0-360) for \"good\" scores.\
  \ [Default: '120']\n\n   [-u <string>]    URL of Krona resources to use instead\
  \ of bundling them\n                    with the chart (e.g. \"http://krona.sourceforge.net\"\
  ).\n                    Reduces size of charts and allows updates, though charts\n\
  \                    will not work without access to this URL.\n\n   [-qp <string>]\
  \   Url to send query IDs to (instead of listing them) for\n                   \
  \ each wedge. The query IDs will be sent as a comma separated\n                \
  \    list in the POST variable \"queries\", with the current\n                 \
  \   dataset index (from 0) in the POST variable \"dataset\". The\n             \
  \       url can include additional variables encoded via GET.\n\n   [-tax <string>]\
  \  Path to directory containing a taxonomy database to use.\n                  \
  \  [Default: '/usr/local/opt/krona/taxonomy']\n\n   [-e <number>]    E-value factor\
  \ for determining \"best\" hits. A bit score\n                    difference threshold\
  \ (-t) is recommended instead to avoid\n                    comparing e-values that\
  \ BLAST reports as 0 due to floating\n                    point underflow. However,\
  \ an e-value factor should be used\n                    if the input is a concatination\
  \ of BLASTs against different\n                    databases.\n\n"
