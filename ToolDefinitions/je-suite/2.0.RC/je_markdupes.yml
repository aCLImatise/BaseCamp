  \ two Unique Molecular Identifiers \n                              (UMIs) identical\
  \ i.e. this option buffers for sequencing errors.Indeed, in case of a \n       \
  \                       sequencing error, 2 duplicate reads would not be considered\
  \ duplicates anymore.Note that \n                              N are not considered\
  \ mismatches during comparison ie ATTNGG and NTTANG are seen as the \n         \
  \                     same barcode and these two reads would be flagged duplicates.This\
  \ option takes a single \n                              value even when several\
  \ barcodes are present (see SLOTS). Note that when declaring \n                \
  \              several barcodes (see SLOTS) AND providing a predefined set of barcodes\
  \ (see BC option), \n                              the MM value is applicable in\
  \ each lookup. When a predefined set of barcodes is NOT \n                     \
  \         given, the different barcodes (SLOTS) are concatenated first and the MM\
  \ value is \n                              therefore considered *overall* as the\
  \ concatenated code is seen as a unique code.\n                              MM=null\

  \ (inclusive). Above this value, reads \n                              are placed\
  \ in a UNDEF group.More precisely, these 'too degenarate' codes will not :\n   \

  \ (SLOTS) are concatenated \n                              first and the MAX_N value\
  \ is therefore considered *overall*.  Default value: null. \n\nSLOTS=Integer\nSLOTS=Integer\

  \        Regular expression that can be used to parse read names in the incoming\

  \ variables: tile/region, x coordinate and y coordinate. \n                    \
  \          These values are used to estimate the rate of optical duplication in\

  \ size. Set this option to null to disable optical duplicate \n                \

  \ extremely large and \n                              estimating library complexity\
  \ is not an aim. Note that without optical duplicate counts, \n                \
  \              library size estimation will be inaccurate. The regular expression\
  \ should contain three \n                              capture groups for the three\
  \ variables, in order. It must match the entire read name. \n                  \
  \            Note that if the default regex is specified, a regex match is not actually\
  \ done, but \n                              instead the read name  is split on colon\
  \ character. For 5 element names, the 3rd, 4th and \n                          \
  \    5th elements are assumed to be tile, x and y values. For 7 element names (CASAVA\
  \ 1.8), \n                              the 5th, 6th, and 7th elements are assumed\
  \ to be tile, x and y values.  Default value: \n                              <optimized\
  \ capture of last three ':' separated fields as numeric values>. This option can\
  \ \n                              be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\
  \nOPTICAL_DUPLICATE_PIXEL_DISTANCE=Integer\n                              The maximum\
  \ offset between two duplicate clusters in order to consider them optical \n   \
  \                           duplicates. The default is appropriate for unpatterned\
  \ versions of the Illumina platform. \n                              For the patterned\
  \ flowcell models, 2500 is moreappropriate. For other platforms and \n         \
  \                     models, users should experiment to find what works best. \
  \ Default value: 100. This option \n                              can be set to\
  \ 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nMAX_FILE_HANDLES_FOR_READ_ENDS_MAP=Integer\n\
  MAX_FILE_HANDLES=Integer      Maximum number of file handles to keep open when spilling\
  \ read ends to disk. Set this \n                              number a little lower\
  \ than the per-process maximum number of file that may be open. This \n        \
  \                      number can be found by executing the 'ulimit -n' command\
  \ on a Unix system.  Default \n                              value: 8000. This option\
  \ can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nSORTING_COLLECTION_SIZE_RATIO=Double\n\
  \                              This number, plus the maximum RAM available to the\
  \ JVM, determine the memory footprint \n                              used by some\
  \ of the sorting collections.  If you are running out of memory, try reducing \n\
  \                              this number.  Default value: 0.25. This option can\
  \ be set to 'null' to clear the default \n                              value. \n\
