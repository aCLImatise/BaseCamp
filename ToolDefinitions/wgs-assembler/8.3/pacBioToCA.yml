  description: Name of the library; freeformat text. Must be unique from any library
    names in the FRG files used for correction

  - -threads
  description: Number of threads to use for correction. Defaults to available cores
    on the local system

  optional: true
  synonyms:
  - -shortReads
  description: Use if the sequences for correction are 100bp or shorter.

  optional: true

  - -genomeSize
  description: <int>          Specify the approximate genome size. This will be used
    to compute the maximum number of bases to correct
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
- !Flag
  optional: true
  synonyms:
  - -maxCoverage
  description: Maximum coverage of PacBio sequences to correct. Only the longest sequences
    adding up to this coverage will be corrected. Requires genomeSize to be specified.
    Defaults to 40X
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: int
- !Flag
  optional: true
  synonyms:
  - -maxGap
  description: 'The maximum uncorrected PacBio gap that will be allowed. When there
    is no short-read coverage for a region, by default the pipeline will split a PacBio
    sequence. This option will attempt to use other PacBio sequences to patch the
    gap and avoid splitting the read. Sequences where the gaps have no support will
    still be broken. For example, specifying 50, will mean any gap 50bp or smaller
    can have no short-read coverage (but has other PacBio sequence support) without
    splitting the PacBio sequence. Warning: this can allow more sequences that went
    through the SMRTbell to not be fixed.'
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: int
- !Flag
  optional: true
  synonyms:
  - -coverageCutoff
  description: Specify the pacBio coverage (integer) used to separate repeat copies
    instead of automatically estimating.
