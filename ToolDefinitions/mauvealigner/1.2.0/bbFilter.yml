help_text: "bbFilter <backbone file> <independent dist> <output file> <beast|gp> [<seq1>\
  \ <seq2>...<seqN>]\nseq index starts at 0.\n\nExample:\nbbFilter my_alignment.backbone\
  \ 50 my_feats.bin gp\nthe above command extracts binary features from \"my_alignment.backbone\"\
  \ which are separated by a minimum of 50nt sequence conserved among all taxa in\
  \ the alignment.  The output is written to my_feats.bin in genoplast format\n\n\n\
  Example 2:\nbbFilter aln.backbone 100 feats.xml beast 0 1 2 5 6\nthe above command\
  \ extracts binary features from \"aln.backbone\" which are separated by a minimum\
  \ of 100nt sequence conserved among genomes 0,1,2,5, and 6 from the alignment. \
  \ The output is written to feats.xml in beast format\n"
