  \nDESCRIPTION: \n\n    Estimate a discrete encoding scheme for probabilistic biological\n\
  \    sequences (PBSs) based on training data.  Input file should be a\n    table\
  \ of probability vectors, with a row for each distinct vector,\n    and a column\
  \ of counts (positive integers) followed by d columns\n    for the elements of the\
  \ d-dimensional probability vectors (see\n    example below).  It may be produced\
  \ with 'prequel' using the\n    --suff-stats option.  Output is a code file that\
  \ can be used with\n    pbsEncode, pbsDecode, etc.  By default, a code of size 255\
  \ is\n    created, so that encoded PBSs can be represented with one byte per\n \
  \   position (the 256th letter in the code is reserved for gaps).  The\n    --nbytes\
  \ option allows larger codes to be created, if desired.\n\n    The code is estimated\
  \ by a two-part procedure designed to minimize\n    the \"training error\" (defined\
  \ as the total KL divergence) of the\n    encoded training data with respect to\
  \ the original training data.\n    First, a \"grid\" is defined for the probability\
  \ simplex,\n    partitioning it into regions that intersect \"cells\" (hypercubes)\n\
  \    in a matrix in d-dimensional space.  This grid has n \"rows\" per\n    dimension.\
  \  By default, n is given the largest possible value such\n    that the number of\
  \ simplex regions is no larger than the target\n    code size, but smaller values\
  \ of n can be specified using --nrows.\n    Each simplex region is assigned a letter\
  \ in the code, and the\n    representative point for that letter is set equal to\
  \ the mean\n    (weighted by the counts) of all vectors in the training data that\n\
  \    fall in that region.  This can be shown to minimize the training\n    error\
  \ for this initial encoding scheme.  (If no vectors fall in a\n    region, then\
  \ the representative point is set equal to the centroid\n    of the region, which\
  \ can be shown to minimize the expected KL\n    divergence of points uniformly distributed\
  \ in the region.)\n\n    In the second part of the estimation procedure, the remaining\n\
  \    letters in the code are defined by a greedy algorithm, which\n    attempts\
  \ to further minimize the training error.  Briefly, on\n    each step, the simplex\
  \ region with the largest contribution to the\n    total error is identified, and\
  \ the next letter in the code is\n    assigned to that region.  In this new encoding,\
  \ there are multiple\n    letters, hence multiple representative points, per region;\
  \ the\n    representative point for a given vector is taken to be the\n    closest,\
  \ in terms of KL divergence, of the representative points\n    associated with the\
  \ simplex region in which that vector falls.\n    When a new representative point\
  \ is added to a region, all\n    representative points for that region are reoptimized\
  \ using a\n    k-means type algorithm.  This procedure is repeated, letter by\n\
  \    letter, until the number of code letters equals the target code\n    size.\n\
