                        \ -i <bed/gff/vcf> -g <genome> [-s <int> or (-p and -m)]\n\
                        \nOptions: \n\t-s\tShift the BED/GFF/VCF entry -s base pairs.\n\
                        \t\t- (Integer) or (Float, e.g. 0.1) if used with -pct.\n\n\
                        \t-p\tShift features on the + strand by -p base pairs.\n\t\
                        \t- (Integer) or (Float, e.g. 0.1) if used with -pct.\n\n\t\
                        -m\tShift features on the - strand by -m base pairs.\n\t\t\
                        - (Integer) or (Float, e.g. 0.1) if used with -pct.\n\n\t\
                        -pct\tDefine -s, -m and -p as a fraction of the feature's\
                        \ length.\n\t\tE.g. if used on a 1000bp feature, -s 0.50,\
                        \ \n\t\twill shift the feature 500 bp \"upstream\".  Default\
                        \ = false.\n\n\t-header\tPrint the header from the input file\
                        \ prior to results.\n\nNotes: \n\t(1)  Starts will be set\
                        \ to 0 if options would force it below 0.\n\t(2)  Ends will\
                        \ be set to the chromosome length if  requested slop would\n\
                        \tforce it above the max chrom length.\n\t(3)  The genome\
                        \ file should tab delimited and structured as follows:\n\n\
                        \t<chromName><TAB><chromSize>\n\n\tFor example, Human (hg19):\n\
                        \tchr1\t249250621\n\tchr2\t243199373\n\t...\n\tchr18_gl000207_random\t\
                        4262\n\nTips: \n\tOne can use the UCSC Genome Browser's MySQL\
                        \ database to extract\n\tchromosome sizes. For example, H.\
                        \ sapiens:\n\n\tmysql --user=genome --host=genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu\
                        \ -A -e \\\n\t\"select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo\" \
                        \ > hg19.genome\n\n"

                        \ from the A file prior to results.\n\n\t-nobuf\tDisable buffered\
                        \ output. Using this option will cause each line\n\t\tof output\
                        \ to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved\n\t\t\
                        in a buffer. This will make printing large output files \n\
                        \t\tnoticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with\n\
                        \t\tother software tools and scripts that need to process\
                        \ one\n\t\tline of bedtools output at a time.\n\n\t-iobuf\t\
                        Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer.\n\t\tTakes\
                        \ an integer argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported.\n\

                        \nNotes: \n\t(1) When a BAM file is used for the A file, the\
                        \ alignment is retained if overlaps exist,\n\tand excluded\
                        \ if an overlap cannot be found.  If multiple overlaps exist,\
                        \ they are not\n\treported, as we are only testing for one\
                        \ or more overlaps.\n\n\n\n\n"

                        \ file. Assumes \"stdin\" if omitted.\n\n\t-g -grp\t\tSpecify\
                        \ the columns (1-based) for the grouping.\n\t\t\tThe columns\
                        \ must be comma separated.\n\t\t\t- Default: 1,2,3\n\n\t-c\
                        \ -opCols\tSpecify the column (1-based) that should be summarized.\n\
                        \t\t\t- Required.\n\n\t-o -ops\t\tSpecify the operation that\
                        \ should be applied to opCol.\n\t\t\tValid operations:\n\t\
                        \t\t    sum, count, count_distinct, min, max,\n\t\t\t    mean,\
                        \ median, mode, antimode,\n\t\t\t    stdev, sstdev (sample\
                        \ standard dev.),\n\t\t\t    collapse (i.e., print a comma\
                        \ separated list (duplicates allowed)), \n\t\t\t    distinct\
                        \ (i.e., print a comma separated list (NO duplicates allowed)),\
                        \ \n\t\t\t    distinct_sort_num (as distinct, but sorted numerically,\
                        \ ascending), \n\t\t\t    distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct,\
                        \ but sorted numerically, descending), \n\t\t\t    concat\
                        \   (i.e., merge values into a single, non-delimited string),\
                        \ \n\t\t\t    freqdesc (i.e., print desc. list of values:freq)\n\
                        \t\t\t    freqasc (i.e., print asc. list of values:freq)\n\
                        \t\t\t    first (i.e., print first value)\n\t\t\t    last\
                        \ (i.e., print last value)\n\t\t\t- Default: sum\n\n\t\tIf\
                        \ there is only column, but multiple operations, all operations\
                        \ will be\n\t\tapplied on that column. Likewise, if there\
                        \ is only one operation, but\n\t\tmultiple columns, that operation\
                        \ will be applied to all columns.\n\t\tOtherwise, the number\
                        \ of columns must match the the number of operations,\n\t\t\
                        and will be applied in respective order.\n\t\tE.g., \"-c 5,4,6\
                        \ -o sum,mean,count\" will give the sum of column 5,\n\t\t\
                        the mean of column 4, and the count of column 6.\n\t\tThe\
                        \ order of output columns will match the ordering given in\
                        \ the command.\n\n\n\t-full\t\tPrint all columns from input\
                        \ file.  The first line in the group is used.\n\t\t\tDefault:\
                        \ print only grouped columns.\n\n\t-inheader\tInput file has\
                        \ a header line - the first line will be ignored.\n\n\t-outheader\t\
                        Print header line in the output, detailing the column names.\
                        \ \n\t\t\tIf the input file has headers (-inheader), the output\
                        \ file\n\t\t\twill use the input's column names.\n\t\t\tIf\

                        \ use \"col_1\", \"col_2\", etc. as the column names.\n\n\t\
                        -header\t\tsame as '-inheader -outheader'\n\n\t-ignorecase\t\
                        Group values regardless of upper/lower case.\n\n\t-prec\t\
                        Sets the decimal precision for output (Default: 5)\n\n\t-delim\t\

                    \ > <BED>.sorted\" will suffice.\n\n\t(3) The input BAM (-ibam)\
                    \ file must be sorted by position.\n\t A \"samtools sort <BAM>\"\

            \ the A file prior to results.\n\n\t-nobuf\tDisable buffered output. Using\
            \ this option will cause each line\n\t\tof output to be printed as it\
            \ is generated, rather than saved\n\t\tin a buffer. This will make printing\
            \ large output files \n\t\tnoticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction\
            \ with\n\t\tother software tools and scripts that need to process one\n\
            \t\tline of bedtools output at a time.\n\n\t-iobuf\tSpecify amount of\

            \ alignment is retained if overlaps exist,\n\tand excluded if an overlap\
            \ cannot be found.  If multiple overlaps exist, they are not\n\treported,\

            \ windows).\n\n\t-n <number_of_windows>\n\t\tDivide each input interval\
            \ (either a chromosome or a BED interval)\n\t\tto fixed number of windows\

            -reverse\n\t\t Reverse numbering of windows in the output, i.e. report\
            \ \n\t\t windows in decreasing order\n\nID Naming Options: \n\t-i src|winnum|srcwinnum\n\
            \t\tThe default output is 3 columns: chrom, start, end .\n\t\tWith this\
            \ option, a name column will be added.\n\t\t \"-i src\" - use the source\
            \ interval's name.\n\t\t \"-i winnum\" - use the window number as the\
            \ ID (e.g. 1,2,3,4...).\n\t\t \"-i srcwinnum\" - use the source interval's\
            \ name with the window number.\n\t\tSee below for usage examples.\n\n\
            Notes: \n\t(1) The genome file should tab delimited and structured as\
            \ follows:\n\t <chromName><TAB><chromSize>\n\n\tFor example, Human (hg19):\n\
            \tchr1\t249250621\n\tchr2\t243199373\n\t...\n\tchr18_gl000207_random\t\
            4262\n\nTips: \n\tOne can use the UCSC Genome Browser's MySQL database\
            \ to extract\n\tchromosome sizes. For example, H. sapiens:\n\n\tmysql\

            Summary: For each feature in A, finds the closest \n\t feature (upstream\

            \ -b <bed/gff/vcf>\n\nOptions: \n\t-d\tIn addition to the closest feature\
            \ in B, \n\t\treport its distance to A as an extra column.\n\t\t- The\
            \ reported distance for overlapping features will be 0.\n\n\t-D\tLike\
            \ -d, report the closest feature in B, and its distance to A\n\t\tas an\
            \ extra column. Unlike -d, use negative distances to report\n\t\tupstream\
            \ features.\n\t\tThe options for defining which orientation is \"upstream\"\
            \ are:\n\t\t- \"ref\"   Report distance with respect to the reference\
            \ genome. \n\t\t            B features with a lower (start, stop) are\
            \ upstream\n\t\t- \"a\"     Report distance with respect to A.\n\t\t \
            \           When A is on the - strand, \"upstream\" means B has a\n\t\t\
            \            higher (start,stop).\n\t\t- \"b\"     Report distance with\
            \ respect to B.\n\t\t            When B is on the - strand, \"upstream\"\
            \ means A has a\n\t\t            higher (start,stop).\n\n\t-io\tIgnore\
            \ features in B that overlap A.  That is, we want close,\n\t\tyet not\
            \ touching features only.\n\n\t-iu\tIgnore features in B that are upstream\
            \ of features in A.\n\t\tThis option requires -D and follows its orientation\n\
            \t\trules for determining what is \"upstream\".\n\n\t-id\tIgnore features\
            \ in B that are downstream of features in A.\n\t\tThis option requires\
            \ -D and follows its orientation\n\t\trules for determining what is \"\
            downstream\".\n\n\t-fu\tChoose first from features in B that are upstream\
            \ of features in A.\n\t\tThis option requires -D and follows its orientation\n\
            \t\trules for determining what is \"upstream\".\n\n\t-fd\tChoose first\
            \ from features in B that are downstream of features in A.\n\t\tThis option\
            \ requires -D and follows its orientation\n\t\trules for determining what\
            \ is \"downstream\".\n\n\t-t\tHow ties for closest feature are handled.\
            \  This occurs when two\n\t\tfeatures in B have exactly the same \"closeness\"\
            \ with A.\n\t\tBy default, all such features in B are reported.\n\t\t\
            Here are all the options:\n\t\t- \"all\"    Report all ties (default).\n\
            \t\t- \"first\"  Report the first tie that occurred in the B file.\n\t\
            \t- \"last\"   Report the last tie that occurred in the B file.\n\n\t\
            -mdb\tHow multiple databases are resolved.\n\t\t- \"each\"    Report closest\
            \ records for each database (default).\n\t\t- \"all\"  Report closest\
            \ records among all databases.\n\n\t-k\tReport the k closest hits. Default\
            \ is 1. If tieMode = \"all\", \n\t\t- all ties will still be reported.\n\
            \n\t-N\tRequire that the query and the closest hit have different names.\n\
            \t\tFor BED, the 4th column is compared.\n\n\t-s\tRequire same strandedness.\
            \  That is, only report hits in B\n\t\tthat overlap A on the _same_ strand.\n\
            \t\t- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.\n\n\
            \t-S\tRequire different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B\n\
            \t\tthat overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.\n\t\t- By default, overlaps\
            \ are reported without respect to strand.\n\n\t-f\tMinimum overlap required\
            \ as a fraction of A.\n\t\t- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).\n\t\t- FLOAT\
            \ (e.g. 0.50)\n\n\t-F\tMinimum overlap required as a fraction of B.\n\t\
            \t- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).\n\t\t- FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)\n\n\t-r\tRequire\
            \ that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.\n\t\t- In other\
            \ words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires\n\t\t  that B overlap\
            \ 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.\n\n\t-e\tRequire that the minimum\
            \ fraction be satisfied for A OR B.\n\t\t- In other words, if -e is used\
            \ with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires\n\t\t  that either 90% of A is\
            \ covered OR 10% of  B is covered.\n\t\t  Without -e, both fractions would\
            \ have to be satisfied.\n\n\t-split\tTreat \"split\" BAM or BED12 entries\
            \ as distinct BED intervals.\n\n\t-g\tProvide a genome file to enforce\
            \ consistent chromosome sort order\n\t\tacross input files. Only applies\
            \ when used with -sorted option.\n\n\t-nonamecheck\tFor sorted data, don't\
            \ throw an error if the file has different naming conventions\n\t\t\t\
            for the same chromosome. ex. \"chr1\" vs \"chr01\".\n\n\t-names\tWhen\
            \ using multiple databases, provide an alias for each that\n\t\twill appear\
            \ instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.\n\n\t-filenames\t\
            When using multiple databases, show each complete filename\n\t\t\tinstead\
            \ of a fileId when also printing the DB record.\n\n\t-sortout\tWhen using\
            \ multiple databases, sort the output DB hits\n\t\t\tfor each record.\n\
            \n\t-bed\tIf using BAM input, write output as BED.\n\n\t-header\tPrint\
            \ the header from the A file prior to results.\n\n\t-nobuf\tDisable buffered\
            \ output. Using this option will cause each line\n\t\tof output to be\
            \ printed as it is generated, rather than saved\n\t\tin a buffer. This\
            \ will make printing large output files \n\t\tnoticeably slower, but can\
            \ be useful in conjunction with\n\t\tother software tools and scripts\
            \ that need to process one\n\t\tline of bedtools output at a time.\n\n\
            \t-iobuf\tSpecify amount of memory to use for input buffer.\n\t\tTakes\

            \ -b <bed/gff/vcf>\n\nOptions: \n\t-A\tRemove entire feature if any overlap.\
            \  That is, by default,\n\t\tonly subtract the portion of A that overlaps\
            \ B. Here, if\n\t\tany overlap is found (or -f amount), the entire feature\
            \ is removed.\n\n\t-N\tSame as -A except when used with -f, the amount\
            \ is the sum\n\t\tof all features (not any single feature).\n\n\t-wb\t\
            Write the original entry in B for each overlap.\n\t\t- Useful for knowing\
            \ _what_ A overlaps. Restricted by -f and -r.\n\n\t-wo\tWrite the original\
            \ A and B entries plus the number of base\n\t\tpairs of overlap between\
            \ the two features.\n\t\t- Overlaps restricted by -f and -r.\n\t\t  Only\
            \ A features with overlap are reported.\n\n\t-s\tRequire same strandedness.\
            \  That is, only report hits in B\n\t\tthat overlap A on the _same_ strand.\n\
            \t\t- By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.\n\n\
            \t-S\tRequire different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B\n\
            \t\tthat overlap A on the _opposite_ strand.\n\t\t- By default, overlaps\
            \ are reported without respect to strand.\n\n\t-f\tMinimum overlap required\
            \ as a fraction of A.\n\t\t- Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).\n\t\t- FLOAT\

            \ that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B.\n\t\t- In other\
            \ words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires\n\t\t  that B overlap\
            \ 90% of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.\n\n\t-e\tRequire that the minimum\
            \ fraction be satisfied for A OR B.\n\t\t- In other words, if -e is used\
            \ with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires\n\t\t  that either 90% of A is\
            \ covered OR 10% of  B is covered.\n\t\t  Without -e, both fractions would\
            \ have to be satisfied.\n\n\t-split\tTreat \"split\" BAM or BED12 entries\

            \ throw an error if the file has different naming conventions\n\t\t\t\
            for the same chromosome. ex. \"chr1\" vs \"chr01\".\n\n\t-sorted\tUse\
            \ the \"chromsweep\" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.\n\n\t\
            -bed\tIf using BAM input, write output as BED.\n\n\t-header\tPrint the\
            \ header from the A file prior to results.\n\n\t-nobuf\tDisable buffered\
            \ output. Using this option will cause each line\n\t\tof output to be\
            \ printed as it is generated, rather than saved\n\t\tin a buffer. This\
            \ will make printing large output files \n\t\tnoticeably slower, but can\
            \ be useful in conjunction with\n\t\tother software tools and scripts\
