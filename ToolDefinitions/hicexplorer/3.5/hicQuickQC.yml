  \                       BED file(s) with all restriction cut places (output of\n\
  \                        \"findRestSite\" command). Should contain only mappable\n\
  \                        restriction sites. If given, the bins are set to match\n\
  \                        the restriction fragments (i.e. the region between one\n\
  \                        restriction site and the next). Alternatively, a fixed\n\

  \                    more than one restriction enzyme, generate for each\n     \
  \                   one a restrictionCutFile and list them space\n             \

  \                     used, please list them space seperated. If a dangling\n  \
  \                      sequence is listed at the same time, please preserve\n  \
  \                      the same order. (default: None)\n  --danglingSequence DANGLINGSEQUENCE\

  \ enzyme\n                        recognizes a different DNA sequence and, after\n\
  \                        cutting, they leave behind a specific \"sticky\" end or\n\
  \                        dangling end sequence. For example, for HindIII the\n \
  \                       restriction site is AAGCTT and the dangling end is\n   \
  \                     AGCT. For DpnII, the restriction site and dangling end\n \
  \                       sequence are the same: GATC. This information is\n     \
  \                   easily found on the description of the restriction\n       \
  \                 enzyme. The dangling sequence is used to classify and\n      \
  \                  report reads whose 5' end starts with such sequence as\n    \
  \                    dangling-end reads. A significant portion of dangling-\n  \
  \                      end reads in a sample are indicative of a problem with\n\
  \                        the re-ligation step of the protocol. (default: None)\n\
