  \ sensitivity.\n   --minMatch m (12) \n               Minimum seed length.  Higher\
  \ minMatch will speed up alignment, \n               but decrease sensitivity.\n\
  \   --maxMatch l (inf)\n               Stop mapping a read to the genome when the\
  \ lcp length reaches l.  \n               This is useful when the query is part\
  \ of the reference, for example when \n               constructing pairwise alignments\
  \ for de novo assembly.\n   --maxLCPLength l (inf)\n               The same as -maxMatch.\n\
  \   --maxAnchorsPerPosition m (10000) \n               Do not add anchors from a\
  \ position if it matches to more than 'm' locations in the target.\n   --advanceExactMatches\
  \ E (0)\n               Another trick for speeding up alignments with match - E\
  \ fewer anchors.  Rather than\n               finding anchors between the read and\
  \ the genome at every position in the read, \n               when an anchor is found\
  \ at position i in a read of length L, the next position \n               in a read\
  \ to find an anchor is at i+L-E.\n               Use this when alignining already\
  \ assembled contigs.\n   --nCandidates n (10)\n               Keep up to 'n' candidates\
  \ for the best alignment.  A large value of n will slow mapping\n              \
  \ because the slower dynamic programming steps are applied to more clusters of anchors\n\
  \               which can be a rate limiting step when reads are very long.\n  \
  \ --concordant(false)\n               Map all subreads of a zmw (hole) to where\
  \ the longest full pass subread of the zmw \n               aligned to. This requires\
  \ to use the region table and hq regions.\n               This option only works\
  \ when reads are in base or pulse h5 format.\n   --fastMaxInterval(false)\n    \
  \           Fast search maximum increasing intervals as alignment candidates. The\
  \ search \n               is not as exhaustive as the default, but is much faster.\n\
  \   --aggressiveIntervalCut(false)\n               Agreesively filter out non-promising\
  \ alignment candidates, if there \n               exists at least one promising\
  \ candidate. If this option is turned on, \n               Blasr is likely to ignore\
  \ short alignments of ALU elements.\n   --fastSDP(false)\n               Use a fast\
  \ heuristic algorithm to speed up sparse dynamic programming.\n\n  Options for Refining\
  \ Hits.\n   --refineConcordantAlignments(false)\n               Refine concordant\
  \ alignments. It slightly increases alignment accuracy at cost of time.\n   --sdpTupleSize\
  \ K (11)\n               Use matches of length K to speed dynamic programming alignments.\
  \  This controls\n               accuracy of assigning gaps in pairwise alignments\
  \ once a mapping has been found,\n               rather than mapping sensitivity\
  \ itself.\n   --scoreMatrix \"score matrix string\" \n               Specify an\
  \ alternative score matrix for scoring fasta reads.  The matrix is \n          \
  \     in the format \n                  ACGTN\n                A abcde\n       \
  \         C fghij\n                G klmno\n                T pqrst\n          \
  \      N uvwxy . The values a...y should be input as a quoted space separated \n\
  \               string: \"a b c ... y\". Lower scores are better, so matches should\
  \ be less \n               than mismatches e.g. a,g,m,s = -5 (match), mismatch =\
  \ 6. \n   --affineOpen value (10) \n               Set the penalty for opening an\
  \ affine alignment.\n   --affineExtend a (0)\n               Change affine (extension)\
  \ gap penalty. Lower value allows more gaps.\n\n Options for overlap/dynamic programming\
  \ alignments and pairwise overlap for de novo assembly. \n   --useQuality (false)\n\
  \               Use substitution/insertion/deletion/merge quality values to score\
  \ gap and \n               mismatch penalties in pairwise alignments.  Because the\
  \ insertion and deletion\n               rates are much higher than substitution,\
  \ this will make many alignments \n               favor an insertion/deletion over\
  \ a substitution.  Naive consensus calling methods \n               will then often\
  \ miss substitution polymorphisms. This option should be \n               used when\
  \ calling consensus using the Quiver method.  Furthermore, when \n             \
  \  not using quality values to score alignments, there will be a lower consensus\
  \ \n               accuracy in homolymer regions.\n   --affineAlign (false)\n  \
  \             Refine alignment using affine guided align.\n\n Options for filtering\
  \ reads and alignments\n   --minReadLength l(50)\n               Skip reads that\
  \ have a full length less than l. Subreads may be shorter.\n   --minSubreadLength\
  \ l(0)\n               Do not align subreads of length less than l.\n   --minRawSubreadScore\
  \ m(0)\n               Do not align subreads whose quality score in region table\
  \ is less than m (quality scores should be in range [0, 1000]).\n   --maxScore m(-200)\n\
  \               Maximum score to output (high is bad, negative good).\n   --minAlnLength\n\
  \               (0) Report alignments only if their lengths are greater than minAlnLength.\n\
  \   --minPctSimilarity\n               (0) Report alignments only if their percentage\
  \ similarity is greater than minPctSimilarity.\n   --minPctAccuracy\n          \
  \     (0) Report alignments only if their percentage accuracy is greater than minAccuracy.\n\
  \n Options for parallel alignment.\n   --nproc N (1)\n               Align using\
  \ N processes.  All large data structures such as the suffix array and \n      \
  \         tuple count table are shared.\n   --start S (0)\n               Index\
  \ of the first read to begin aligning. This is useful when multiple instances \n\
  \               are running on the same data, for example when on a multi-rack cluster.\n\
  \   --stride S (1)\n               Align one read every 'S' reads.\n\n Options for\
  \ subsampling reads.\n   --subsample (0)\n               Proportion of reads to\
  \ randomly subsample (expressed as a decimal) and align.\n   --holeNumbers LIST\
  \ \n               When specified, only align reads whose ZMW hole numbers are in\
  \ LIST.\n               LIST is a comma-delimited string of ranges, such as '1,2,3,10-13'.\n\
  \               This option only works when reads are in bam, bax.h5 or plx.h5 format.\n\
