help_text: "NAME\n    map2slim - maps gene associations to a 'slim' ontology\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\
  \      cd go\n      map2slim GO_slims/goslim_generic.obo ontology/gene_ontology.obo\
  \ gene-associations/gene_association.fb\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    Given a GO slim file,\
  \ and a current ontology (in one or more files),\n    this script will map a gene\
  \ association file (containing annotations to\n    the full GO) to the terms in\
  \ the GO slim.\n\n    The script can be used to either create a new gene association\
  \ file,\n    containing the most pertinent GO slim accessions, or in count-mode,\
  \ in\n    which case it will give distinct gene product counts for each slim term\n\
  \n    The association file format is described here:\n\n    <http://www.geneontology.org/GO.annotation.shtml#file>\n\
  \nARGUMENTS\n    -b bucket slim file\n        This argument adds bucket terms to\
  \ the slim ontology; see the\n        documentation below for an explanation. The\
  \ new slim ontology file,\n        including bucket terms will be written to bucket\
  \ slim file\n\n    -outmap slim mapping file\n        This will generate a mapping\
  \ file for every term in the full\n        ontology showing both the most pertinent\
  \ slim term and all slim\n        terms that are ancestors. If you use this option,\
  \ do NOT supply a\n        gene-associations file\n\n    shownames\n        (Only\
  \ works with -outmap)\n\n        Show the names of the term in the slim mapping\
  \ file\n\n    -c  This will force map2slim to give counts of the assoc file, rather\n\
  \        than map it\n\n    -t  When used in conjunction with -c will tab the output\
  \ so that the\n        indentation reflects the tree hierarchy in the slim file\n\
  \n    -o out file\n        This will write the mapped assocs (or counts) to the\
  \ specified file,\n        rather than to the screen\n\nDOWNLOAD\n    This script\
  \ is part of the go-perl package, available from CPAN\n\n    <http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-perl/>\n\
  \n    This script will not work without installing go-perl\n\n  MAPPING ALGORITHM\n\
  \    GO is a DAG, not a tree. This means that there is often more than one\n   \
  \ path from a GO term up to the root Gene_Ontology node; the path may\n    intersect\
  \ multiple terms in the slim ontology - which means that one\n    annotation can\
  \ map to multiple slim terms!\n\n    (note you need to view this online to see the\
  \ image below - if you are\n    not viewing this on the http://www.geneontology.org\
  \ site, you can look\n    at the following URL:\n    <http://geneontology.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/geneontology/go-dev/\n\
  \    go-perl/doc/map2slim.gif> )\n\n    A hypothetical example blue circles show\
  \ terms in the GO slim, and\n    yellow circles show terms in the full ontology.\
  \ The full ontology\n    subsumes the slim, so the blue terms are also in the ontology.\n\
  \n      GO ID  MAPS TO SLIM ID        ALL SLIM ANCESTORS\n      =====  ===============\
  \        ==================\n      5      2+3                    2,3,1\n      6\

  \ pertinent ID(s) in the slim the direct\n    mapping. The 3rd column shows all\
  \ ancestors in the slim.\n\n    Note in particular the mapping of ID 9 although\
  \ this has two paths to\n    the root through the slim via 3 and 4, 3 is discarded\
  \ because it is\n    subsumed by 4.\n\n    On the other hand, 10 maps to both 2\
  \ and 3 because these are both the\n    first slim ID in the two valid paths to\
  \ the root, and neither subsumes\n    the other.\n\n    The algorithm used is:\n\
  \n    to map any one term in the full ontology: find all valid paths through\n \
  \   to the root node in the full ontology\n\n    for each path, take the first slim\
  \ term encountered in the path\n\n    discard any redundant slim terms in this set\
  \ ie slim terms subsumed by\n    other slim terms in the set\n\n  BUCKET TERMS\n\
  \    If you run the script with the -b option, bucket terms will be added.\n   \
  \ For any term P in the slim, if P has at least one child C, a bucket term\n   \
  \ P' will be created under P. This is a catch-all term for mapping any\n    term\
  \ in the full ontology that is a descendant of P, but NOT a\n    descendant of any\
  \ child of P in the slim ontology.\n\n    For example, the slim generic.0208 has\
  \ the following terms and\n    structure:\n\n        %DNA binding ; GO:0003677\n\
  \         %chromatin binding ; GO:0003682 \n         %transcription factor activity\
  \ ; GO:0003700, GO:0000130\n\n    After adding bucket terms, it will look like this:\n\
  \n       %DNA binding ; GO:0003677\n        %chromatin binding ; GO:0003682\n  \
  \      %transcription factor activity ; GO:0003700 ; synonym:GO:0000130\n      \
  \  @bucket:Z-OTHER-DNA binding ; slim_temp_id:12\n\n    Terms from the full ontology\
  \ that are other children of DNA binding,\n    such as single-stranded DNA binding\
  \ and its descendents will map to the\n    bucket term.\n\n    The bucket term has\
  \ a slim ID which is transient and is there only to\n    facilitate the mapping.\
  \ It should not be used externally.\n\n    The bucket term has the prefix Z-OTHER;\
  \ the Z is a hack to make sure\n    that the term is always listed last in the alphabetic\
  \ ordering.\n\n    The algorithm is slightly modified if bucket terms are used.\
  \ The bucket\n    term has an implicit relationship to all OTHER siblings not in\
  \ the slim.\n\n   Do I need bucket terms?\n    Nowadays most slim files are entirely\
  \ or nearly 'complete', that is\n    there are no gaps. This means the the -b option\
  \ will not produce\n    noticeable different results. For example, you may see a\
  \ bucket term\n    OTHER-binding created, with nothing annotated to it: because\
  \ all the\n    children of binding in the GO are represented in the slim file.\n\
  \n    The bucket option is really only necessary for some of the older\n    archived\
  \ slim files, which are static and were generated in a fairly\n    ad-hoc way; they\
  \ tend to accumulate 'gaps' over time (eg GO will add a\n    new child of binding,\
  \ but the static slim file won't be up to date, so\n    any gene products annotated\
  \ to this new term will map to OTHER-binding\n    in the slim)\n\n  GRAPH MISMATCHES\n\
  \    Note that the slim ontology file(s) may be out of date with respect to\n  \
  \  the current ontology.\n\n    Currently map2slim does not flag graph mismatches\
  \ between the slim graph\n    and the graph in the full ontology file; it takes\
  \ the full ontology as\n    being the real graph. However, the slim ontology will\
  \ be used to format\n    the results if you select -t -c as options.\n\n  OUTPUT\n\
  \    In normal mode, a standard format gene-association file will be written.\n\
  \    The GO ID column (5) will contain GO slim IDs. The mapping corresponds\n  \
  \  to the 2nd column in the table above. Note that the output file may\n    contain\
  \ more lines that the input file. This is because some full GO IDs\n    have more\
  \ than one pertinent slim ID.\n\n   COUNT MODE\n    map2slim can be run with the\
  \ -c option, which will gives the counts of\n    distinct gene products mapped to\
  \ each slim term. The columns are as\n    follows\n\n    GO Term\n        The first\
  \ column is the GO ID followed by the term name (the term\n        name is provided\
  \ as it is found in both the full GO and slim\n        ontologies - these will usually\
  \ be the same but occasionally the\n        slim file will lage behind changes in\
  \ the GO file)\n\n    Count of gene products for which this is the most relevant\
  \ slim term\n        the number of distinct gene products for which this is the\
  \ most\n        pertinent/direct slim ID. By most direct we mean that either the\n\
  \        association is made directly to this term, OR the association is\n    \
  \    made to a child of this slim term AND there is no child slim term\n       \
  \ which the association maps to.\n\n        For most slims, this count will be equivalent\
  \ to the number of\n        associations directly mapped to this slim term. However,\
  \ some older\n        slim files are \"spotty\" in that they admit \"gaps\". For\
  \ example, if\n        the slim has all children of \"biological process\" with\
  \ the exception\n        of \"behavior\" then all annotations to \"behavior\" or\
  \ its children\n        will be counted here\n\n        see example below\n\n  \
  \  Count of gene products inferred to be associated with slim term\n        and\
  \ the number of distinct gene products which are annotated to any\n        descendant\
  \ of this slim ID (or annotated directly to the slim ID).\n\n    obsoletion flag\n\
