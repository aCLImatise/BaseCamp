  \nSample names and read groups may be specified by supplying a sample name or read\
  \ group\nargument after each listed BAM file.\n\nWhen no sample names are supplied,\
  \ the names of the BAM files are used as the sample\nnames and read groups.  When\
  \ no read groups are supplied, the sample names are used\nas read groups.\n\nauthor:\
