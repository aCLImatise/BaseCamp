  \                                 [--layout LAYOUT] [--no-metadata] [--no-data]\n\

  \             [--download-dir DOWNLOAD_DIR]\n\nFiles are always downloaded to a\
  \ cache / filestore directory called '.hca'. This directory is created in the\n\
  current directory where download is initiated. A copy of the manifest used is also\
  \ written to the current\ndirectory. This manifest has an added column that lists\
  \ the paths of the files within the '.hca' filestore.\n\nThe default layout is none.\
  \ In this layout all of the files are downloaded to the filestore and the\nrecommended\
  \ way of accessing the files in by parsing the manifest copy that's written to the\
  \ download\ndirectory.\n\nThe bundle layout still downloads all of files to the\
  \ filestore. For each bundle mentioned in the\nmanifest a directory is created.\
  \ All relevant metadata files for each bundle are linked into these\ndirectories\
  \ in addition to relevant data files mentioned in the manifest.\n\nEach row in the\
  \ manifest represents one file in DSS. The manifest must have a header row. The\
  \ header row\nmust declare the following columns:\n\n- bundle_uuid - the UUID of\
  \ the bundle containing the file in DSS.\n- bundle_version - the version of the\
  \ bundle containing the file in DSS.\n- file_name - the name of the file as specified\
  \ in the bundle.\n- file_uuid - the UUID of the file in the DSS.\n- file_sha256\
  \ - the SHA-256 hash of the file.\n- file_size - the size of the file.\n\nThe TSV\
  \ may have additional columns. Those columns will be ignored. The ordering of the\
  \ columns is\ninsignificant because the TSV is required to have a header row.\n\n\
  This download format will serve as the main storage format for downloaded files.\
  \ If a user specifies a different\nformat for download (coming in the future) the\
  \ files will first be downloaded in this format, then hard-linked\nto the user's\
  \ preferred format.\n\nOptional Arguments:\n  -h, --help            show this help\
  \ message and exit\n\nRequired Arguments:\n  --manifest MANIFEST   The path to a\
  \ TSV (tab-separated values) file listing files to download. If the directory\n\
  \                        for download already contains the manifest, the manifest\
  \ will be overwritten to include a column with paths\n                        into\
  \ the filestore.\n  --replica REPLICA     The replica from which to download. The\
  \ supported replicas are: aws for Amazon Web\n                        Services,\
  \ and gcp for Google Cloud Platform. [aws, gcp]\n  --layout LAYOUT       The layout\
  \ of the downloaded files. Currently two options are supported, 'none' (the\n  \
  \                      default), and 'bundle'.\n  --no-metadata         Exclude\
  \ metadata files. Cannot be set when --metadata-filter is also set.\n  --no-data\
  \             Exclude data files. Cannot be set when --data-filter is also set.\n\
  \  --num-retries NUM_RETRIES\n                        The initial quota of download\
