help_text: "/usr/local/bin/miRDeep2_core_algorithm.pl file_signature file_structure\n\
  \nThis is the core algorithm of miRDeep. It takes as input a file in blastparsed\
  \ format with\ninformation on the positions of reads aligned to potential precursor\
  \ sequences (signature).\nIt also takes as input an RNAfold output file, giving\
  \ information on the sequence, structure\nand mimimum free energy of the potential\
  \ precursor sequences.\n\nExtra arguments can be given. -s specifies a fastafile\
  \ containing the known mature miRNA\nsequences that should be considered for conservation\
  \ purposes. -t prints out the potential\nprecursor sequences that do _not_ exceed\
  \ the cut-off (default prints out the sequences that\nexceeds the cut-off). -u gives\
  \ limited output, that is only the ids of the potential precursors\nthat exceed\
  \ the cut-off. -v varies the cut-off. -x is a sensitive option for Sanger sequences\n\
  obtained through conventional cloning. -z consider the number of base pairings in\
  \ the lower\nstems (this option is not well tested).\n\n-h print this usage\n-s\
  \ fasta file with known miRNAs\n-t print filtered\n-u limited output (only ids)\n\
  -v cut-off (default 1)\n-x sensitive option for Sanger sequences\n-y file with randfold\
  \ p-values\n-z consider Drosha processing\n"
