                        \  * Node count: The number of nodes in the graph. Only positive\
                        \ nodes are counted (i.e. each complementary pair counts as\
                        \ one).\n  * Edge count: The number of edges in the graph.\
                        \ Only one edge in each complementary pair is counted.\n \
                        \ * Smallest edge overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp)\
                        \ for the edges in the graph.\n  * Largest edge overlap: The\
                        \ smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\
                        \ For most graphs this will be the same as the smallest edge\
                        \ overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n  * Total\
                        \ length: The total number of base pairs in the graph.\n \
                        \ * Total length no overlaps: The total number of base pairs\

                        \ overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances where\

                        \  * Percentage dead ends: The proportion of possible dead\
                        \ ends. The maximum number of dead ends is twice the number\
                        \ of nodes (occurs when there are no edges), so this value\
                        \ is the number of dead ends divided by twice the node count.\n\
                        \  * Connected components: The number of regions of the graph\
                        \ which are disconnected from each other.\n  * Largest component:\
                        \ The total number of base pairs in the largest connected\
                        \ component.\n  * N50: Nodes that are this length or greater\
                        \ will collectively add up to at least half of the total length.\n\
                        \  * Shortest node: The length of the shortest node in the\
                        \ graph.\n  * Lower quartile node: The median node length\
                        \ for the shorter half of the nodes.\n  * Median node: The\
                        \ median node length for the graph.\n  * Upper quartile node:\
                        \ The median node length for the longer half of the nodes.\n\

                    \ The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\n\

                    \ divided by twice the node count.\n  * Connected components:\
                    \ The number of regions of the graph which are disconnected from\
                    \ each other.\n  * Largest component: The total number of base\

                    \ are this length or greater will collectively add up to at least\
                    \ half of the total length.\n  * Shortest node: The length of\

                \ The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph. For\

                \ in edge overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances where\
                \ an end of a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n  * Percentage\
                \ dead ends: The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number\
                \ of dead ends is twice the number of nodes (occurs when there are\
                \ no edges), so this value is the number of dead ends divided by twice\

            \ edge overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n  * Total length:\

            \ dead ends: The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number\

  help_text: "\nBandage info takes a graph file as input and outputs (to stdout) the\
    \ following statistics about the graph:\n  * Node count: The number of nodes in\
    \ the graph. Only positive nodes are counted (i.e. each complementary pair counts\
    \ as one).\n  * Edge count: The number of edges in the graph. Only one edge in\
    \ each complementary pair is counted.\n  * Smallest edge overlap: The smallest\
    \ overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\n  * Largest edge overlap:\
    \ The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph. For most graphs\
    \ this will be the same as the smallest edge overlap (i.e. all edges have the\
    \ same overlap).\n  * Total length: The total number of base pairs in the graph.\n\
    \  * Total length no overlaps: The total number of base pairs in the graph, subtracting\
    \ bases that are duplicated in edge overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances\
    \ where an end of a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n  * Percentage\
    \ dead ends: The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number of dead\
    \ ends is twice the number of nodes (occurs when there are no edges), so this\
    \ value is the number of dead ends divided by twice the node count.\n  * Connected\
    \ components: The number of regions of the graph which are disconnected from each\
    \ other.\n  * Largest component: The total number of base pairs in the largest\
    \ connected component.\n  * N50: Nodes that are this length or greater will collectively\
    \ add up to at least half of the total length.\n  * Shortest node: The length\
    \ of the shortest node in the graph.\n  * Lower quartile node: The median node\
    \ length for the shorter half of the nodes.\n  * Median node: The median node\
    \ length for the graph.\n  * Upper quartile node: The median node length for the\
    \ longer half of the nodes.\n  * Longest node: The length of the longest node\
    \ in the graph.\n  * Median depth: The median depth of the graph, by base.\n \
    \ * Estimated sequence length: An estimate of the total number of bases in the\
    \ original sequence, calculated by multiplying each node's length (minus overlaps)\
    \ by its depth relative to the median.\n          \nUsage:    Bandage info <graph>\
