            \ the following statistics about the graph:\n  * Node count: The number\
            \ of nodes in the graph. Only positive nodes are counted (i.e. each complementary\
            \ pair counts as one).\n  * Edge count: The number of edges in the graph.\
            \ Only one edge in each complementary pair is counted.\n  * Smallest edge\
            \ overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\n\
            \  * Largest edge overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges\
            \ in the graph. For most graphs this will be the same as the smallest\
            \ edge overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n  * Total length:\
            \ The total number of base pairs in the graph.\n  * Total length no overlaps:\
            \ The total number of base pairs in the graph, subtracting bases that\
            \ are duplicated in edge overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances\
            \ where an end of a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n  * Percentage\
            \ dead ends: The proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number\
            \ of dead ends is twice the number of nodes (occurs when there are no\
            \ edges), so this value is the number of dead ends divided by twice the\
            \ node count.\n  * Connected components: The number of regions of the\
            \ graph which are disconnected from each other.\n  * Largest component:\
            \ The total number of base pairs in the largest connected component.\n\
            \  * N50: Nodes that are this length or greater will collectively add\
            \ up to at least half of the total length.\n  * Shortest node: The length\
            \ of the shortest node in the graph.\n  * Lower quartile node: The median\
            \ node length for the shorter half of the nodes.\n  * Median node: The\
            \ median node length for the graph.\n  * Upper quartile node: The median\
            \ node length for the longer half of the nodes.\n  * Longest node: The\
            \ length of the longest node in the graph.\n  * Median depth: The median\
            \ depth of the graph, by base.\n  * Estimated sequence length: An estimate\
            \ of the total number of bases in the original sequence, calculated by\

        \ overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges in the graph.\n\
        \  * Largest edge overlap: The smallest overlap size (in bp) for the edges\
        \ in the graph. For most graphs this will be the same as the smallest edge\
        \ overlap (i.e. all edges have the same overlap).\n  * Total length: The total\
        \ number of base pairs in the graph.\n  * Total length no overlaps: The total\
        \ number of base pairs in the graph, subtracting bases that are duplicated\
        \ in edge overlaps.\n  * Dead ends: The number of instances where an end of\
        \ a node does not connect to any other nodes.\n  * Percentage dead ends: The\
        \ proportion of possible dead ends. The maximum number of dead ends is twice\
        \ the number of nodes (occurs when there are no edges), so this value is the\
        \ number of dead ends divided by twice the node count.\n  * Connected components:\
        \ The number of regions of the graph which are disconnected from each other.\n\
        \  * Largest component: The total number of base pairs in the largest connected\
        \ component.\n  * N50: Nodes that are this length or greater will collectively\
        \ add up to at least half of the total length.\n  * Shortest node: The length\
        \ of the shortest node in the graph.\n  * Lower quartile node: The median\
        \ node length for the shorter half of the nodes.\n  * Median node: The median\
        \ node length for the graph.\n  * Upper quartile node: The median node length\
        \ for the longer half of the nodes.\n  * Longest node: The length of the longest\
        \ node in the graph.\n  * Median depth: The median depth of the graph, by\
        \ base.\n  * Estimated sequence length: An estimate of the total number of\
        \ bases in the original sequence, calculated by multiplying each node's length\
