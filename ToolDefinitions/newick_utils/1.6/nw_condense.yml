help_text: "Simplifies a tree by collapsing certain nodes.\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\
  \nnw_condense [-hm:u] <tree|->\n\nInput\n-----\n\nArgument is either the name of\
  \ a file that contains one or more trees, or '-',\nin which case the trees are read\
  \ on stdin.\n\nOutput\n------\n\nThe tree(s) with pure clades collapsed. A pure\
  \ clade is a clade in which\nall leaves have the same label, and it is replaced\
  \ by a leaf of the same\nlabel: (A,(B,(B,B))); has a pure clade of B, and will be\
  \ replaced by\n(A,B);. The collapsed clade's support value (if any) is preserved,\
  \ as is\nits parent edge's length (if specified).\n(see Options below for variants)\n\
