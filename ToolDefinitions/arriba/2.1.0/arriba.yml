  \ in a read. If \n                         the number of mismatches is too high,\
  \ the read is discarded. \n                         Default: 0.010000 \n\n -F FRAGMENT_LENGTH\
  \  When paired-end data is given, the fragment length is estimated \n          \
  \           automatically and this parameter has no effect. But when single-end\
  \ \n                     data is given, the mean fragment length should be specified\
  \ to \n                     effectively filter fusions that arise from hairpin structures.\
  \ \n                     Default: 200 \n\n -U MAX_READS  Subsample fusions with\
  \ more than the given number of supporting reads. This \n               improves\
  \ performance without compromising sensitivity, as long as the \n              \
  \ threshold is high. Counting of supporting reads beyond the threshold is \n   \
  \            inaccurate, obviously. Default: 300 \n\n -Q QUANTILE  Highly expressed\
  \ genes are prone to produce artifacts during library \n              preparation.\
  \ Genes with an expression above the given quantile are eligible \n            \
  \  for filtering by the 'in_vitro' filter. Default: 0.998000 \n\n -e EXONIC_FRACTION\
  \  The breakpoints of false-positive predictions of intragenic events \n       \
  \              are often both in exons. True predictions are more likely to have\
  \ at \n                     least one breakpoint in an intron, because introns are\
  \ larger. If the \n                     fraction of exonic sequence between two\
  \ breakpoints is smaller than \n                     the given fraction, the 'intragenic_exonic'\
  \ filter discards the \n                     event. Default: 0.330000 \n\n -T TOP_N\
  \  Only report viral integration sites of the top N most highly expressed viral\
  \ \n           contigs. Default: 5 \n\n -C COVERED_FRACTION  Ignore virally associated\
  \ events if the virus is not fully \n                      expressed, i.e., less\
  \ than the given fraction of the viral contig is \n                      transcribed.\
  \ Default: 0.150000 \n\n -l MAX_ITD_LENGTH  Maximum length of internal tandem duplications.\
  \ Note: Increasing \n                    this value beyond the default can impair\
  \ performance and lead to many \n                    false positives. Default: 100\
  \ \n\n -u  Instead of performing duplicate marking itself, Arriba relies on duplicate\
  \ marking by a \n     preceding program using the BAM_FDUP flag. This makes sense\
  \ when unique molecular \n     identifiers (UMI) are used. \n\n -X  To reduce the\
  \ runtime and file size, by default, the columns 'fusion_transcript', \n     'peptide_sequence',\
  \ and 'read_identifiers' are left empty in the file containing \n     discarded\
  \ fusion candidates (see parameter -O). When this flag is set, this extra \n   \
  \  information is reported in the discarded fusions file. \n\n -I  If assembly of\
  \ the fusion transcript sequence from the supporting reads is incomplete \n    \
  \ (denoted as '...'), fill the gaps using the assembly sequence wherever possible.\
