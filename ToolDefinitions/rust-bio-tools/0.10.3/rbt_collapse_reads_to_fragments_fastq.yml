  Tool to merge sets of reads from paired FASTQ files that share the UMI and have\
  \ similar read sequence. The result is a\nmaximum likelihood fragment sequence per\
  \ set with base quality scores improved accordingly.\n\nTakes two FASTQ files (forward\
  \ and reverse) and returns two FASTQ files in which all PCR duplicates have been\
  \ merged\ninto a consensus read.\nDuplicates are identified by a Unique Molecular\
  \ Identifier (UMI).\n\nAssumptions:\n  - Reads are of equal length\n  - UMI is the\
  \ prefix of the reads\n\nExample:\nrbt collapse-reads-to-fragments fastq \\\n  reads_1.fq\
  \ reads_2.fq \\    # input files\n  merged_1.fq merged_2.fq \\  # output files\n\
  \  -l 13 \\                    # length of UMI\n  -d 1 \\                     #\
