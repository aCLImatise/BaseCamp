help_text: "\n Minimo is a de novo assembler based on the AMOS infrastructure. Minimo\
  \ uses a\n conservative overlap-layout-consensus algorithm to avoid mis-assemblies\
  \ and\n can be applied to short read or strand-specific assemblies. The input is\
  \ a\n FASTA file and there are options to control the stringency of the assembly\n\
  \ and the processing of the quality scores. By default, the results are in the\n\
  \ AMOS format and written to the directory where the input FASTA file is located.\n\
  \n Usage:\n     Minimo FASTA_IN [options]\n\n Options:\n     -D QUAL_IN=<file> \
  \  Input quality score file (in Phred format)\n     -D GOOD_QUAL=<n>    Quality\
  \ score to set for bases within the clear\n                           range if no\
  \ quality file was given (default: 30)\n     -D BAD_QUAL=<n>     Quality score to\
  \ set for bases outside clear range\n                           if no quality file\
  \ was given (default: 10). If your\n                           sequences are trimmed,\
  \ try the same value as GOOD_QUAL.\n     -D MIN_LEN=<n>      Minimum contig overlap\
  \ length (at least 20 bp, \n                           default: 35)\n     -D MIN_IDENT=<d>\
  \    Minimum contig overlap identity percentage (between 0\n                   \
  \        and 100 %, default: 98)\n     -D STRAND_SPEC=<n>  Do a strand-specific\
  \ assembly (e.g. for transcripts)\n                           (0:no 1:yes, default:\
  \ 0)\n     -D ALN_WIGGLE=<d>   Alignment wiggle value (from 2 for short reads to\
  \ 15 for\n                           long reads, default: 2)\n     -D FASTA_EXP=<n>\
  \    Export results in FASTA format (0:no 1:yes, default: 0)\n     -D ACE_EXP=<n>\
  \      Export results in ACE format (0:no 1:yes, default: 0)\n     -D OUT_PREFIX=<s>\
  \   Prefix to use for the output file path and name\n\n Minimo v1.8 Copyright Florent\
