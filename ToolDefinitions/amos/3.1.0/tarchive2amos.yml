  .DESCRIPTION.\n  This program takes a files from the NCBI trace archive and produces\
  \ \n  an afg file for AMOS.  \n\n  <prefix> - prefix for the output files\n\n  fasta1\
  \ ... fastan - list of files to be converted.\n           \n  The program assumes\
  \ that for each file called <file>.seq there\n  is a <file>.qual and a <file>.xml.\
  \ (alternatively the files may\n  be called fasta.<file>, qual.<file> and xml.<file>).\n\
  \  If no .xml file is present the program will only produce a set of\n  RED (read)\
  \ records.\n\n\n.OPTIONS.\n  -assembly <assembly> - XML file containing assembly\
  \ in assembly archive format\n                   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/assembly/assmbrowser.cgi\n\
  \                   usually named ASSEMBLY.xml in the tar-ball downloaded from NCBI\n\
  \n  -tracedir <tracedir> - directory containing the trace information as downloaded\n\
  \                   from the NCBI, either from the assembly archive or through\n\
  \                   a direct query in the trace archive.  This directory must contain\n\
  \                   a file named TRACEINFO.xml as well as one or more subdirs\n\
  \                   containing the trace information for the organism(s) whose\n\
  \                   traces are being processed.\n\n  -c <clip>      - file containing\
  \ clear ranges for the reads.  If this file\n                   is provided, any\
  \ sequence that does not appear in it is\n                   excluded from the output.\n\
  \n  -m <mates>     - file containing mate-pair information as specified in the\n\
  \                   BAMBUS documentation.  This file replaces information\n    \
  \               provided in .xml files\n\n  -l <lib>       - file containing mean/stdev\
  \ information for libraries.\n                   Overrides .xml input.\n\n  -i <id>\
  \        - start numbering messages with id <id>\n                   (useful when\
  \ appending to a bank)\n\n  -min <minlen>  - reads shorter than <minlen> are rejected\
  \ (default 0)\n  -max <maxlen>  - reads longer than <maxlen> are rejected (default\
  \ no limit)\n\n  -qual <qval>   - default quality value assigned when no quality\
  \ file is\n                   provided (default 20)\n\n.KEYWORDS.\n  converters,\
  \ trace archive, AMOS\n\n\n"
