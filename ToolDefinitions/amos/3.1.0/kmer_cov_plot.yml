help_text: "Usage: kmer-cov-plot KMER_FILE < (FASTA_FILE | FASTQ_FILE)\nPrints the\
  \ k-mer coverage beginning at each base in a set of DNA sequences.\n\nThe set of\
  \ DNA sequences is read as a FASTA or FASTQ file from standard input.\nKMER_FILE\
  \ specifies a FASTA file that contains the k-mer counts for\nthe set of DNA sequences.\
  \  Each FASTA tag line provides a k-mer count,\nand the following sequence line\
  \ provides the k-mer.  Alternatively,\nKMER_FILE may specify a Jellyfish hash table\
  \ if the -j option is given.\n\nThe k-mer length is determined automatically from\
  \ the KMER_FILE.\n\nBy default, the tag line of sequence is printed, followed\n\
  by a line for each k-mer in the sequence. The first column is the index\nof the\
  \ k-mer, starting from 1, and the remaining three columns are:\n     (count(fmer)\
  \ + count(rmer))   count(fmer)   count(rmer)\nwhere count(fmer) indicates the count\
  \ of the forward k-mer and count(rmer)\nindicates the count of the reverse k-mer.\n\
