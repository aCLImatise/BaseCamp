help_text: "tdbQuery - Query the trackDb system using SQL syntax.\nUsage:\n    tdbQuery\
  \ sqlStatement\nWhere the SQL statement is enclosed in quotations to avoid the shell\
  \ interpreting it.\nOnly a very restricted subset of a single SQL statement (select)\
  \ is supported.   Examples:\n    tdbQuery \"select count(*) from hg18\"\ncounts\
  \ all of the tracks in hg18 and prints the results to stdout\n   tdbQuery \"select\
  \ count(*) from *\"\ncounts all tracks in all databases.\n   tdbQuery \"select \
  \ track,shortLabel from hg18 where type like 'bigWig%'\"\nprints to stdout a a two\
  \ field .ra file containing just the track and shortLabels of bigWig \ntype tracks\
  \ in the hg18 version of trackDb.\n   tdbQuery \"select * from hg18 where track='knownGene'\
  \ or track='ensGene'\"\nprints the hg18 knownGene and ensGene track's information\
  \ to stdout.\n   tdbQuery \"select *Label from mm9\"\nprints all fields that end\
  \ in 'Label' from the mm9 trackDb.\nOPTIONS:\n   -root=/path/to/trackDb/root/dir\n\
  Sets the root directory of the trackDb.ra directory hierarchy to be given path.\
  \ By default\nthis is ~/kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb.\n   -check\nCheck that trackDb\
  \ is internally consistent.  Prints diagnostic output to stderr and aborts if \n\
  there's problems.\n   -strict\nMimic -strict option on hgTrackDb. Suppresses tracks\
  \ where corresponding table does not exist.\n   -release=alpha|beta|public\nInclude\
  \ trackDb entries with this release tag only. Default is alpha.\n   -noBlank\nDon't\
  \ print out blank lines separating records\n   -oneLine\nPrint single ('|') pipe-separated\
  \ line per record\n   -noCompSub\nSubtracks don't inherit fields from parents\n\
  \   -shortLabelLength=N\nComplain if shortLabels are over N characters\n   -longLabelLength=N\n\
  Complain if longLabels are over N characters\n\n"
