  \                    In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates\n        \
  \                (percent identity scores) between two genomes that\n          \
  \              have little to do with each other simply because only\n         \
  \               a small fraction of their content may be aligned. This\n       \
  \                 can be partly alleviated by considering the *full*\n         \
  \               percent identity, which includes in its calculation\n          \
  \              regions that did not align. For example, if the\n               \
  \         alignment is a whopping 97 percent identity but only 8\n             \
  \           percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent\n                \
  \        identity is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078 OR 7.8 percent.\n                   \
  \     *full* percent identity is always included in the\n                      \
  \  report, but you can also use it as a filter for other\n                     \
  \   metrics, such as percent identity. This filter will\n                      \
  \  set all ANI measures between two genomes to 0 if the\n                      \
  \  *full* percent identity is less than you deem\n                        trustable.\
  \ When you set a value, anvi'o will go\n                        through the ANI\
  \ results, and set all ANI measures\n                        between two genomes\
  \ to 0 if the *full* percent\n                        identity *between either of\
  \ them* is less than the\n                        parameter described here. The\
  \ default is 0.\n\nSourmash Settings:\n  Tell anvi'o to tell sourmash what settings\
  \ to set. Only if `--program` is\n  set to `sourmash`\n\n  --kmer-size INT     \
  \  Set the k-mer size for mash similarity checks. We\n                        found\
  \ 13 in almost all cases correlates best with\n                        alignment-based\
  \ ANI.\n  --scale INT           Set the compression ratio for fasta signature file\n\
  \                        computations. The default is 1000. Smaller ratios\n   \
  \                     decrease sensitivity, while larger ratios will lead to\n \
  \                       large fasta signatures.\n\nHIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING:\n  anvi-compute-genome-similarity\
  \ outputs similarity matrix files, which can\n  be clustered into nice looking dendrograms\
  \ to display the relationships\n  between genomes nicely (in the anvi'o interface\
  \ and elsewhere). Here you\n  can set the distance metric and the linkage algorithm\
  \ for that.\n\n  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC\n                        The distance\
  \ metric for the hierarchical clustering.\n                        The default is\
  \ \"euclidean\".\n  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD\n                        The linkage\
  \ method for the hierarchical clustering.\n                        The default is\
  \ \"ward\".\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT STUFF:\n  Yes. You're almost done.\n\n  -T NUM_THREADS,\
  \ --num-threads NUM_THREADS\n                        Maximum number of threads to\
  \ use for multithreading\n                        whenever possible. Very conservatively,\
  \ the default is\n                        1. It is a good idea to not exceed the\
  \ number of CPUs\n                        / cores on your system. Plus, please be\
  \ careful with\n                        this option if you are running your commands\
  \ on a SGE\n                        --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking\
  \ for\n                        multiple threads to use, you may deplete your\n \
  \                       resources very fast.\n  --just-do-it          Don't bother\
  \ me with questions or warnings, just do\n                        it.\n  --log-file\
  \ FILE_PATH  File path to store debug/output messages.\n"
