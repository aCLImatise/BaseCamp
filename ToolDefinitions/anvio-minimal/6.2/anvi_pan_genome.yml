  \  Anvi'o attempts to generate a hierarchical clustering\n                     \
  \   of your gene clusters once it identifies them so you\n                     \
  \   can use `anvi-display-pan` to play with it. But if you\n                   \

  \                        If you want anvi'o to try to generate a hierarchical\n\
  \                        clustering of your gene clusters even if the number of\n\
  \                        gene clusters exceeds its suggested limit for\n       \
  \                 hierarchical clustering, you can use this flag to\n          \
  \              enforce it. Are you are a rebel of some sorts? Or did\n         \

  \                 The distance metric for the clustering of gene\n             \
  \           clusters. If you do not use this flag, the default\n               \
  \         distance metric will be used for each clustering\n                   \
  \     configuration which is \"euclidean\".\n  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD\n      \
