  \                the coverage of non-outlier positions of genes in\n           \

  \         layers according to each one of the aforementioned\n                 \
  \       views. In addition, all layer ordering that are\n                      \
  \  available in the regular mode (i.e. the full mode\n                        where\
  \ you have contigs/splits) are also available in\n                        'gene\
  \ mode', so that, for example, you can choose to\n                        order\
  \ the layers according to 'detection', and that\n                        would be\
  \ the order according to the detection values\n                        of splits,\
  \ whereas if you choose 'genes_detections'\n                        then the order\
  \ of layers would be according to the\n                        detection values\
  \ of genes. Inspection and sequence\n                        functionality are available\
  \ (through the right-click\n                        menu), except now sequences\
  \ are of the specific gene.\n                        Inspection has now two options\
  \ available: 'Inspect\n                        Context', which brings you to the\
  \ inspection page of\n                        the split to which the gene belongs\
  \ where the\n                        inspected gene will be highlighted in yellow\
  \ in the\n                        bottom, and 'Inspect Gene', which opens the inspection\n\
  \                        page only for the gene and 100 nts around each side of\n\
  \                        it (the purpose of this option is to make the\n       \
  \                 inspection page load faster if you only want to look\n       \
  \                 at the nucleotide coverage of a specific gene).\n            \
  \            NOTICE: You can't store states or collections in 'gene\n          \
  \              mode'. However, you still can make fake selections,\n           \
  \             and create fake bins for your viewing convenience only\n         \
  \               (smiley). Search options are available, and you can\n          \
  \              even search for functions if you have them in your\n            \
  \            contigs database. ANOTHER NOTICE: loading this mode\n             \
  \           might take a while if your bin has many genes, and\n               \
  \         your profile database has many samples, this is\n                    \
  \    because the gene coverages stats are computed in an\n                     \
  \   ad-hoc manner when you load this mode, we know this is\n                   \
  \     not ideal and we plan to improve that (along with\n                      \
  \  other things). If you have suggestions/complaints\n                        regarding\

  \              that whenever possible.\n  --split-hmm-layers    When declared, this\
  \ flag tells the interface to split\n                        every gene found in\

  \ your system default, you can\n                        provide a full path for\
  \ an alternative browser using\n                        this parameter, and hope\
  \ for the best. For instance we\n                        are using this parameter\
  \ to call Google's experimental\n                        browser, Canary, which\

  \   disabled.\n  --server-only         The default behavior is to start the local\
  \ server, and\n                        fire up a browser that connects to the server.\
  \ If you\n                        have other plans, and want to start the server\
  \ without\n                        calling the browser, this is the flag you need.\n\
  \  --password-protected  If this flag is set, command line tool will ask you to\n\
  \                        enter a password and interactive interface will be\n  \
  \                      only accessible after entering same password. This\n    \
  \                    option is recommended for shared machines like\n          \
  \              clusters or shared networks where computers are not\n           \
  \             isolated.\n  --user-server-shutdown\n                        Allow\
