  \ by running `pip install           \n              h5py==2.8.0` in your anvi'o\
  \ environment. The reason why the standard anvi'o     \n              package does\
  \ not include this module is both complicated and really unimportant.\n        \
  \      Re-running the migration after `h5py` is installed will make things go smootly.\
