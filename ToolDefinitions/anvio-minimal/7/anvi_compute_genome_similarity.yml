  \                       --min-alignment-fraction is your shield to protect\n   \
  \                     yourself from incoming garbage, --significant-\n         \
  \               alignment-length is your chopstick to pick out those\n         \
  \               that may be interesting, and you are a true warrior\n          \
  \              here. (default: None)\n  --min-full-percent-identity FULL_PERCENT_IDENTITY\n\
  \                        In some cases you may get high raw ANI estimates\n    \
  \                    (percent identity scores) between two genomes that\n      \
  \                  have little to do with each other simply because only\n     \
  \                   a small fraction of their content may be aligned. This\n   \
  \                     can be partly alleviated by considering the *full*\n     \
  \                   percent identity, which includes in its calculation\n      \
  \                  regions that did not align. For example, if the\n           \
  \             alignment is a whopping 97 percent identity but only 8\n         \
  \               percent of the genome aligned, the *full* percent\n            \
  \            identity is 0.970 * 0.080 = 0.078 OR 7.8 percent.\n               \
  \         *full* percent identity is always included in the\n                  \
  \      report, but you can also use it as a filter for other\n                 \
  \       metrics, such as percent identity. This filter will\n                  \
  \      set all ANI measures between two genomes to 0 if the\n                  \
  \      *full* percent identity is less than you deem\n                        trustable.\
  \ When you set a value, anvi'o will go\n                        through the ANI\
  \ results, and set all ANI measures\n                        between two genomes\
  \ to 0 if the *full* percent\n                        identity *between either of\
  \ them* is less than the\n                        parameter described here. The\
  \ default is 0.\n\nSourmash Settings:\n  Tell anvi'o to tell sourmash what settings\
  \ to set. Only if `--program` is\n  set to `sourmash`\n\n  --kmer-size INT     \
  \  Set the k-mer size for mash similarity checks. We\n                        found\
  \ 13 in almost all cases correlates best with\n                        alignment-based\
  \ ANI. (default: None)\n  --scale INT           Set the compression ratio for fasta\
  \ signature file\n                        computations. The default is 1000. Smaller\
  \ ratios\n                        decrease sensitivity, while larger ratios will\
  \ lead to\n                        large fasta signatures. (default: 1000)\n\nHIERARCHICAL\
  \ CLUSTERING:\n  anvi-compute-genome-similarity outputs similarity matrix files,\
  \ which can\n  be clustered into nice looking dendrograms to display the relationships\n\
  \  between genomes nicely (in the anvi'o interface and elsewhere). Here you\n  can\
  \ set the distance metric and the linkage algorithm for that.\n\n  --distance DISTANCE_METRIC\n\
  \                        The distance metric for the hierarchical clustering.\n\
  \                        The default is \"euclidean\".\n  --linkage LINKAGE_METHOD\n\
  \                        The linkage method for the hierarchical clustering.\n \
  \                       The default is \"ward\".\n\nOTHER IMPORTANT STUFF:\n  Yes.\
  \ You're almost done.\n\n  -T NUM_THREADS, --num-threads NUM_THREADS\n         \
  \               Maximum number of threads to use for multithreading\n          \
  \              whenever possible. Very conservatively, the default is\n        \
  \                1. It is a good idea to not exceed the number of CPUs\n       \
  \                 / cores on your system. Plus, please be careful with\n       \
  \                 this option if you are running your commands on a SGE\n      \
  \                  --if you are clusterizing your runs, and asking for\n       \
  \                 multiple threads to use, you may deplete your\n              \
  \          resources very fast. (default: 1)\n  --just-do-it          Don't bother\
  \ me with questions or warnings, just do\n                        it. (default:\
