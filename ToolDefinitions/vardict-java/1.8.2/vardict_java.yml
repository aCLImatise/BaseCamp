  \        [-B #_reads] region_info\nVarDict is a variant calling program for SNV,\
  \ MNV, indels (<50 bp), and complex variants.  It accepts any BAM format, either\n\
  from DNA-seq or RNA-seq.  There are several distinct features over other variant\
  \ callers.  First, it can perform local\nrealignment over indels on the fly for\
  \ more accurate allele frequencies of indels.  Second, it rescues softly clipped\
  \ reads\nto identify indels not present in the alignments or support existing indels.\
  \  Third, when given the PCR amplicon information,\nit will perform amplicon-based\
  \ variant calling and filter out variants that show amplicon bias, a common false\
  \ positive in PCR\nbased targeted deep sequencing.  Forth, it has very efficient\
  \ memory management and memory usage is linear to the region of\ninterest, not the\
  \ depth.  Five, it can handle ultra-deep sequencing and the performance is only\
  \ linear to the depth.  It has\nbeen tested on depth over 2M reads.  Finally, it\
  \ has a build-in capability to perform paired sample analysis, intended for\nsomatic\
