  Mandatory Parameters:\n\n  <table> Path for the file that contains the table of\

  \ the reference genome (GR).\n\n  <dirGO> Path for the directory where the script\
  \ can locate the FASTA files \n          of the chromosomes of the genome (GO) which\

  \ 1 : LASTZ parameters for closely related species.\n  + Level 2 : Default level\n\
  \  + Level 3 : LASTZ parameters for distantly related species.\n  [Default value\
  \ = 2]\n\n\n  --max_length_sr N\n\n  Maximum length for sequence SR: N = integer\
  \ bigger than zero\n  If SR length is bigger than N, the breakpoint receives the\n\
  \  status -6 and it is not processed by the segmentation step.\n  [Default value\
  \ = 1000000000]\n\n\n  --max_length_sab N\n\n  Maximum length for sequences SA and\
  \ SB: N = integer bigger than zero\n  If SA (or SB) length is bigger than N, the\
  \ length is corrected\n  to fit this limit value.\n  [Default value = 3000000]\n\
  \ \n\n  --minimum_length N\n\n  Minimum sequence length: N = integer bigger than\
  \ zero\n  If one or more sequences have length smaller than N, the breakpoint receives\n\
  \  one of the status -2, -3 , -4 or -5 and  it is not processed by the \n  segmentation\
  \ step.\n  [Default value = 1 (for genes) or 50000 (for synteny blocks)]\n\n\n \
  \ --extend_before [T/F]\n\n  Extend before verify length: True [T] or FALSE [F]\n\

  \ genes.\n  [Default value = T]\n\n\n  --extend_by_adding_fragment N\n\n  Extend\
  \ sequences SR, SA and SB: N = integer bigger than or equal to zero\n  Extend sequences\
  \ SR, SA and SB by adding to them a fragment of length N \n  from the sides that\
  \ are supposed to be orthologous. It is equivalent to add\n  the orthologous genes\
  \ (Ar,Ao) and (Br,Bo) to the sequences.\n  Warning: This parameter is available\
  \ only for table of synteny blocks.\n  [Default value = 50000]\n\n\n  --extend_ab_by_adding_fragment\
  \ N\n\n  Extend sequences SA and SB: N = integer bigger than or equal to zero\n\
  \  Extend sequences SA and SB by adding to them a fragment of length N \n  from\
