  \t<input filename> is the name of a file containing multiple trees in\n\tNewick\
  \ format. Each tree should be on a seperate line. In each tree\n\tall leaves should\
  \ be labeled and all trees should have the same set\n\tof leaf labels.\n\tIf [output\
  \ filename] is specified the output is written to the file\n\tpointed to (if the\
  \ file already exists the current content is deleted\n\tfirst), otherwise the output\
  \ is written to stdout.\n\tThe output is a lower triangular matrix in which the\
  \ i, j'th entry\n\tis the pairwise quartet distance between the tree on line i and\
  \ the\n\ttree on line j in <input filename>.\n\n"
