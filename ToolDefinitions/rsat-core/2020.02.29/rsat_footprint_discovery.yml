  \n        The file format is one organisms per line, the comment char is \";\"\n\

  \ option can be used iteratively on the command line to specify\n        multiple\
  \ genes.\n\n    \e[1m-genes\e[0m\n        Specify a file containing a list of genes.\
  \ Multiple genes can also\n        be specified by using iteratively the option\
  \ -q.\n\n    \e[1m-all_genes\e[0m\n        Automatically analyze all the genes of\
  \ a query genome, and store\n        each result in a separate folder (the folder\
  \ name is defined\n        automatically).\n\n    \e[1m-max_genes\e[0m\n       \
  \ Maximal number of genes to analyze.\n\n    \e[1m-skip #\e[0m\n        Skip the\

  \ tasks).\n\n    \e[1m-last #\e[0m\n        Stop after having treated the first\
  \ # genes (useful for quick\n        testing).\n\n    \e[1m-o output_root_dir\e\
  [0m\n        Main output directory. The results will be dispatched in\n        sub-directories,\
  \ defined according to the taxon, query organism and\n        query gene name(s).\n\
  \n        If the main output dir is not specified, the program automatically\n \
  \       sets it to \"footprints\".\n\n    \e[1m-batch\e[0m\n        Generate one\
  \ command per query gene, and post it on the queue of a\n        PC cluster.\n\n\
  \    \e[1m-dry\e[0m\n        Dry run: print the commands but do not execute them.\n\
  \n    \e[1m-nodie\e[0m\n        Do not die in case a sub-program returns an error.\n\
  \n        The option -nodie allows you to circumvent problems with specific\n  \
  \      sub-tasks, but this is not recommended because the results may be\n     \
  \   incomplete.\n\n    \e[1m-sep_genes\e[0m\n        Search footprints for each\
  \ query gene separately. The results are\n        stored in a separate folder for\
  \ each gene. The folder name is\n        defined automatically.\n\n        By default,\
  \ when several query genes are specified, the program\n        collects orthologs\
  \ and analyzes their promoters altogether. The\n        option \e[33m-sep\e[0m allows\
  \ to automatize the detection of footprint in a set\n        of genes that will\
  \ be treated separately.\n\n    \e[1m-infer_operons\e[0m\n        Infer operons\
  \ in order to retrieve the promoters of the predicted\n        operon leader genes\
  \ rather than those located immediately upstream\n        of the orthologs. This\
  \ method uses a threshold on the intergenic\n        distance.\n\n    \e[1m-dist_thr\
  \ value\e[0m\n        Specify here the intergenic distance threshold in base pairs.\
  \ Pair\n        of adjacent genes with intergenic distance equal or less than this\n\
  \        value are predicted to be within operon. (default : 55)\n\n    \e[1m-task\e\
  [0m\n        Specify a subset of tasks to be executed.\n\n        By default, the\
  \ program runs all necessary tasks. However, in some\n        cases, it can be useful\
  \ to select one or several tasks to be\n        executed separately. For instance,\
  \ after having collected all the\n        promoter sequences of ortholog genes,\
  \ one might desire to run the\n        pattern detection with various parameter\
  \ values without having to\n        retrieve the same sequences each time.\n\n \
  \       Beware: task selection requires expertise, because most tasks\n        depends\
  \ on the prior execution of some other tasks in the workflow.\n        Selecting\
  \ tasks before their prerequisite tasks have been completed\n        will provoke\
  \ fatal errors.\n\n        \e[1mSupported tasks:\e[0m\n\n        For all footprint\
  \ programs (\e[33mfootprint-discovery\e[0m,\n        \e[33mfootprint-scan\e[0m).\n\
  \n            \e[33mall\e[0m Run all supported tasks. If no task is specified, all\
