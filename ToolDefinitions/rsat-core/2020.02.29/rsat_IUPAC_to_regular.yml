          \ highest scoring peaks. In some cases, the top-scoring peaks\n        might\
          \ contain a higher density of binding sites, allowing to detect\n      \
          \  motifs with a higher significance.\n\n        This option can also be\
          \ convenient for performing quick tests,\n        parameter selection and\
          \ debugging before running the full analysis\n        of large sequence\

          \ in some transcription factor database\n        (e.g. RegulonDB, Jaspar,\
          \ TRANSFAC) for the transcription factor of\n        interest. Even though\
          \ these annotations may come from low-throughput\n        experiments, and\
          \ rely on a poor number of sites, such reference\n        motif(s) may be\
          \ informative to check correspondence between\n        discovered motifs\
          \ an prior knowledge.\n\n        Each discovered motif can be compared to\
          \ the reference motif(s), in\n        order to evaluate its correspondence\
          \ with the binding motif of the\n        factor of interest.\n\n       \
          \ Reference motif(s) should be provided in TRANSFAC format (see\n      \

          \n         - DB name\n\n         - matrix format. same supported formats\
          \ as convert-matrices, but we\n           recommend to use a format that\

          \n         - file containing the DB motifs\n\n        The option can be\
          \ called iteratively on the same command line in\n        order to compare\
          \ discovered motifs with several databases.\n\n        Examples:\n\n   \

          \ (k, specified with option -l) in the test set\n            (van Helden\
          \ et al., 1998). Prior frequencies of oligonucleotides\n            are\

          \ region of fixed\n            width but variable content (van Helden et\
          \ al., 2000). Spaced\n            motifs are typical of certain classes\
          \ of transcription factors\n            forming homo- or heterodimers.\n\
          \n            By default, peak-motifs analyzes pairs of trinucleotides with\n\
          \            any spacing between 0 and 20.\n\n            The expected frequency\
          \ of each dyad is estimated as the product\n            of its monad frequencies\
          \ in the sequences (option -bg monads of\n            dyad-analysis).\n\n\
          \        \e[33mpositions\e[0m\n            Run \e[33mposition-analysis\e\

          \ have a non-homogeneous distribution in the\n            peak sequence\
          \ set.\n\n            This method was initially developed to analyze termination\
          \ and\n            poly-adenylation signals in downstream sequences (van\
          \ Helden et\n            al., 2001), and it turns out to be very efficient\
          \ for detecting\n            motifs centred on the ChIP-seq peaks. For ChIP-seq\
          \ analysis, the\n            reference position is the center of each sequence.\n\
          \n            The reference position can however be changed with the option\n\
          \            \e[33m-origin\e[0m (center, start, end).\n\n            Note\
          \ that \e[33mpeak-motifs\e[0m also uses \e[33mposition-analysis\e[0m for\
          \ the task\n            \e[1mcomposition\e[0m, in order to detect compositional\
          \ biases (residues,\n            dinucleotides) in the test sequence set.\n\

          [0m to detect locally over-represented\n            oligonucleotides and\
          \ dyads.\n\n            The program \e[33mlocal-word-analysis\e[0m (Matthieu\
          \ Defrance,unpublished)\n            tests the over-representation of each\
          \ possible word (oligo,\n            dyad) in positional windows in the\
          \ sequence set.\n\n            Two types of background models are supported:\

          \ a positive or a negative\n        value. Positive value indicate the length\

          \ the order of the Markov\n        model relative to the oligonucleotide\

          \  The analysis can be performed either on a single gene, or several genes\n\
          \    separately (option -sep_genes), or on a group of genes altogether.\n\
          \n    Query genes can be entered on the command line (option -q) or in a\
          \ text\n    file (option-genes). Alternatively, the option -all_genes will\
          \ run the\n    analysis on all the genes of a genome.\n\n  \e[1mPosition-specific\
          \ scoring matrices (PSSMs)\e[0m\n    \e[33mfootprint-scan\e[0m requires\
          \ a collection of (at least one) position-specific\n    scoring matrices\
          \ (PSSM).\n\n    All the format supported by \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m can\
          \ be used to enter the\n    matrices. However, we recommend to use the TRANSFAC\
          \ format, which\n    supports multiple matrices (we usually want tos can\
          \ promoters with a\n    full collection of matrices), and associates an\
          \ identifier with each\n    matrix (e.g. the name of the transcription factor).\n\
          \n   Example of TRANSFAC format\n    The following example shows a text\
          \ file describing two matrices,\n    representing the binding motifs annotated\
          \ in RegulonDB for AgaR and\n    AraC, respectively. Motifs must be separated\
          \ by a line containing a\n    double slash (//).\n\n    The complete file\
          \ can be downloaded from RegulonDB\n    (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/).\n\

          \    high-scoring sites with matrix-scan.\n\n    However, observing a single\

          \n    As we know sequences with a functional relevance migth be conserved\n\

            \ urn with\n4 balls, each ball representing one possible\nnucleotide (A,\
            \ C, G, T).\nFor the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\nwant\
            \ to compare the two IUPAC codes Y (C or T) and M\n(A or C). in the urn\
            \ (alphabet), we will label in\nblack the balls (nucleotides) comprised\
            \ in the first\nset (C and T). We can now consider the second IUPAC\n\
            letter as a random selection of 2 balls in this urn,\nwhich contains 2\
            \ black balls (A, C) and 2 white balls\n(G, T). Our selection (C and T)\
            \ contains one black\nball. It is thus a match.\nThe right tail of the\
            \ hypergeometric distribution\nallows us to calculate the probability\
            \ to observe at\nleast one back ball in a selection of 2 balls,\nselected\

          \nUSAGE\n\tcompare-patterns seq1 seq2\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n\tCount matching\
          \ residues between pairs of patterns from two\n\tsets, and assess the statistical\
          \ significance of the\n\tmatches. Patterns can be described using the IUPAC\
          \ code for\n\tambiguous nucleotides. Spaced patterns (dyads) are also\n\t\
          supported.\n\n\tThis program is typically used to compare a set of discovered\n\
          \tpatterns (e.g. oligo-analysis result) with a set of known\n\ttranscription\
          \ factor binding sites (e.g. sites stored in the\n\tTRANSFAC database).\n\
          \nCATEGORY\n\tutil\n\tsequences\n\nOPTIONS\n\t-h\tdisplay full help message\n\
          \t-help   (must be first argument) display options\n\t-v\tverbose\n\t-seq1\t\

          \ the same command line\n\t\tto enter multiple patterns.\n\t-seq2\tsecond\
          \ sequence for the comparison\n\n\t\tThe options -seq1 and -seq2 can be\
          \ used iteratively to\n\t\tspecify multiple sequence patterns. Each sequence\
          \ of\n\t\tgroup 1 is then compared to each sequence of group 2.\n\t\t  \
          \ ex: -seq1 gataag -seq1 gattag -seq1 gataah \n\t\t       -seq2 agataata\
          \ -seq2 gtttag\n\t\t Note that when many patterns have to be entered, the\n\
          \t\t options -file1 and -file2 are more convenient.\n\t-file1 \tfile containing\
          \ a list of patterns to be used as first\n         \tsequences for the comparison\
          \ (see format below). \n\t-file2 \tfile containing a list of patterns to\
          \ be used as second\n         \tsequences for the comparison (see format\
          \ below). \n\t-return\treturn fields\n\t\tEach selected field is returned\
          \ in a separate column.\n\t\tSupported: match,Pval,Eval_p,sig_p,Eval_f,sig_f,noffs,weight,seq,id,length,offset,strand,max_w,diff_w,rel_w,top_s\n\
          \n        -uth field #\n                upper threshold value for a given\
          \ field\n                Supported_fields: match,Pval,Eval_p,sig_p,Eval_f,sig_f,weight,len1,len2,mlen,tlen,offset,max_w1,max_w2,max_w,diff_w1,diff_w2,diff_w,rel_w1,rel_w2,rel_w\n\

          \ by sliding seq2 along seq1\n\t\tWhen this option is used, the best offset\
          \ is also\n\t\treturned. The offset is the number of positions to\n\t\t\
          shift seq1 in order to obtain the best scoring\n\t\talignment. Negative\
          \ values represent a shit of seq2 to\n\t\tthe left side, positive values\
          \ ot the right side.\n\n\t-2str \tMatch on both strands \n\t\tIn addition\
          \ to the direct matching (strand = D), the\n\t\treverse complement of each\
          \ pattern of group 1\n\t\t(specified by -seq1 or -file1) is matched against\
          \ each\n\t\tpattern of group2.\n\n\t-table field\n\t       Return a contingency\
          \ table, where each row corresponds\n\t       to one sequence from file\
          \ 1, each column to a sequence\n\t       from file 2, and the cells contain\
          \ the value of the\n\t       specified field.\n\t       Supported fields:\
          \ match,Pval,Eval_p,sig_p,Eval_f,sig_f,weight,offset,strand,max_w,diff_w,rel_w1,rel_w2,rel_w,top_s\n\
          \n\t-null   null string (default ) displayed in\n                contingency\
          \ tables when the cell contains a value\n                which does not\
          \ pass the thresholds.\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n    PATTERNS\n\tseq1 and seq2 must\
          \ be DNA sequences (not peptidic). \n        IUPAC degenerate code is accepted\
          \ in seq1 as well as seq2.\n\n    PATTERN FILE\n\tA pattern file is a tab-delimited\
          \ text file. Each row contains\n\tthe description of one pattern. Column\
          \ content:\n\t  1) Pattern sequence. This is the only mandatory column.\n\
          \t  2) Pattern ID (optional).\n\tAdditional columns can be used to specify\
          \ other pattern\n\tattributes (description, score, ...), but they are by\
          \ default\n\tignored by the program. The option -sc allows to specify a\n\
          \tscore column.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n       The output consists in a tab-separated\
          \ text table, with one row\n       per pair of sequences, and one column\
          \ per return field.\n\nRETURN FIELDS\n       match\tnumber of matching positions\n\
          \n       Pval     P-value for a single comparison. \n\n       \t       \
          \ This represents the probability, for the comparison\n       \t       \
          \ between two sequences, to return a match.\n\n       \t\tWhen the simple\
          \ nucleotide alphabet (A, C, G, T) is\n       \t\tused, the probability\

          \ are considered\n\t\tequiprobable.\n\n\t\tThe program also scores matches\

          \                nucleotides is calculated with the hypergeometric\n   \
          \             distribution.\n\n\t\tThe underlying probabilistic model is\
          \ that the two\n\t\tletters to be macthed represent each a subset of the\n\
          \t\talphabet. The problem can be thought of as an urn with\n\t\t4 balls,\
          \ each ball representing one possible\n\t\tnucleotide (A, C, G, T).\n\n\t\
          \tFor the sake of illustration, let us assume that we\n\t\twant to compare\
          \ the two IUPAC codes Y (C or T) and M\n\t\t(A or C). in the urn (alphabet),\
          \ we will label in\n\t\tblack the balls (nucleotides) comprised in the first\n\
          \t\tset (C and T). We can now consider the second IUPAC\n\t\tletter as a\
          \ random selection of 2 balls in this urn,\n\t\twhich contains 2 black balls\
          \ (A, C) and 2 white balls\n\t\t(G, T). Our selection (C and T) contains\
          \ one black\n\t\tball. It is thus a match.\n\n\t\tThe right tail of the\
          \ hypergeometric distribution\n\t\tallows us to calculate the probability\
          \ to observe at\n\t\tleast one back ball in a selection of 2 balls,\n\t\t\
          selected at random in an urn with 2 black balls and 2\n\t\twhite balls.\n\

          [33mconvert-matrix\e[0m. For a\n    description of these format, see \e\

          \ SCHEME\e[0m\n  \e[1mWEIGHT SCORE\e[0m\n    The program scans the input\
          \ sequences with a position-specific scoring\n    matrix (PSSM) by selecting,\
          \ at each position, a sequence segment (S) of\n    the same length as the\
          \ matrix, and assigning a score to this segment.\n\n    The segment score\
          \ (weight) is calculated according to the theory\n    developed by Jerry\
          \ Hertz and Gary Stormo (1999), but with the capability\n    to use Markov\
          \ chain-based background models, as proposed by Thijs et al.\n    (2001).\n\
          \n    The weight of a sequence segment (Ws) is calculated as the log-ratio\n\
          \    between two probabilities:\n\n    \e[33mWs = log[P(S|M)/P(S|B)]\e[0m\n\
          \        where\n\n    \e[33mproba_M = P(S|M)\e[0m:\n        The probability\
          \ to generate the sequence segment given the matrix.\n\n    \e[33mproba_B\
          \ = P(S|B)\e[0m:\n        The probability to generate the sequence segment\
          \ given the\n        background model.\n\n    By default, the program uses\
          \ natural logarithms, but the option -base\n    allows to specify any alternative\
          \ base (e.g. 2 to obtain bit units);\n\n  \e[1mMOTIF MODEL\e[0m\n    The\
          \ position-specific scoring matrix is generally built from an\n    alignment\
          \ of transcription factor binding sites. The matrix indicates\n    the absolute\
          \ frequency (Nij = number of occurrences) of each residue (i\n    = row)\
          \ at each position (j = column) of the alignment.\n\n    Note: some programs\
          \ use \"vertical\" matrices, where rows represents\n    positions and columns\
          \ residues. See \e[33mconvert-matrix\e[0m for a description of\n    PSSM\
          \ formats.\n\n   Pseudo-counts\n    Relative frequencies can be corrected\
          \ by a pseudo-count (b) to reduce\n    the bias due to the small number\
          \ of observations.\n\n    The pseudo-count can be shared either in an equiprobable\
          \ way,\n\n      S<F''ij=(Nij + b/A)/[SUMi(Nij)+b]>\n\n    or according to\
          \ residue prior frequencies.\n\n      S<F''ij=(Nij + b*Pi)/[SUMi(Nij)+b]>\n\
          \n    where\n\n    Pi  is the prior frequency for residue i\n\n    A   is\
          \ the size of the alphabet (A=4 for DNA).\n\n    b   is the pseudo-count,\
          \ which is \"shared\" between residues according to\n        their prior\
          \ frequencies.\n\n  \e[1mBACKGROUND MODELS\e[0m\n    An essential parameter\
          \ of any pattern detection approach is the choice\n    of an appropriate\
          \ background model. This model is used to estimate the\n    probability\
          \ for each site to occur by chance, rather than as an instance\n    of the\
          \ motif.\n\n    The program matrix-scan supports Markov models of arbitrary\
          \ order as\n    background models. A Markov model of \e[33morder m\e[0m\
          \ means that the probability\n    of each residue depends on the \e[33mm\e\
          [0m preceding residues in the sequence.\n    Note that a Markov model of\
          \ order 0 corresponds to a Bernoulli model\n    (each residue is independent\
          \ from the preceding ones).\n\n    Markov models are represented as transition\
          \ matrices, where each row\n    represents a prefix and each column a residue\
          \ (suffix), and each cell\n    represents the conditional probability \e\
          [33mP(r|prefix)\e[0m of observing residue\n    \e[33mr\e[0m at a given position,\
          \ given the prefix (the \e[33mm\e[0m preceding letters).\n\n   Background\
          \ model specification\n    The background model can be specified in different\
          \ ways.\n\n    \e[33m-bgfile\e[0m\n        This option allows to enter the\
          \ background model from a background\n        model file. Background model\
          \ files are tab-delimited files\n        containing the specification of\
          \ oligonucleotide frequencies. A\n        Markov model of order m=k-1 is\
          \ automatically obtained from the\n        frequencies of oligonucleotides\
          \ of length k. There is thus no need\n        to use the option -markov\
          \ when the background model is secified with\n        a bg file.\n\n   \
          \     The RSAT data folder contains pre-calibrated background model files\n\
          \        for all the supported organisms. Use the command\n        \e[33mchoose-background-model\e\
          [0m to get the path of an organism-specific\n        background model file.\n\
          \n        Different formats are supported (option B-<bg_format>).\n\n  \
          \  \e[33m-bginput\e[0m\n        The backgound model is calculated from the\
          \ whole set of input\n        sequences. This option requires to specify\
          \ the order of the\n        background model with the option -markov.\n\n\
          \    \e[33m-window\e[0m\n        The background model is calculated locally\
          \ at each step of the scan,\n        by computing transition frequencies\
          \ from a sliding window centred\n        around the considered segment.\
          \ The model is thus updated at each\n        scanned position. This model\
          \ is called \"adaptive\". Note that the\n        sliding window must be\
          \ large enough to train the local Markov model.\n        The required sequence\
          \ length increases exponentially with the Markov\n        order. This option\
          \ is thus usually suitable for low order models\n        only (-markov 0\

          \ of pseudo-count can be extended to \e[1mpseudo-frequencies\e[0m for\n\
          \    the background model, in order to increase the robustness of BG models\n\
          \    when the training sequence set is too small. This is particularly\n\
          \    important for the adaptive models, which are trained on relatively\
          \ short\n    sliding windows (a few hundreds of bases).\n\n    The reason\
          \ for using pseudo-frequencies rather than pseudo-counts is\n    that background\
          \ models are usually defined in terms of relative\n    frequencies, considered\
          \ as estimates of prior frequencies. Since the\n    absolute counts used\
          \ for estimating those probabilities are not always\n    available, we introduce\
          \ the correction in terms of pseudo-frequencies.\n\n    P'(r|prefix)=((P(r|prefix)\

          \ (the sum per column in\n    the residue count matrix).\n\n    This idea\
          \ was propsed by Geert Thijs (PhD thesis) as an empirical way to\n    choose\
          \ the pseudo-count. This rule makes sense, since the relative\n    impact\
          \ of the pseudo-count decreases when the number of sites increases.\n  \
          \  The square root makes sense because it is proportional to the standard\n\
          \    deviation of a Poisson sampling (the variance of the Poisson\n    distribution\
          \ equals its mean).\n\n  \e[1mHit table\e[0m\n    Export a table with one\
          \ row per input sequence, one column per matrix,\n    where the value of\
          \ a cell \e[33mh_{i,j}\e[0m indicates the number of hits for\n    matrix\

          [0m\n    Return a m x m table (where m is the number of input matrices)\
          \ where the\n    value of a cell \e[33mc_{i,j}\e[0m indicates the number\
          \ of input sequences having\n    at least one site for matrix \e[33mM_i\e\
          [0m and on site for matrix \e[33mM_j\e[0m.\n\n    The goal is to detect\
          \ pairs of co-occuring motifs in order to predict\n    putatively interacting\
          \ transcription factors. The motifs do not need to\n    be individually\
          \ over-represented, what matters here is that they are\n    foudn together\
          \ more frequently than expected by chance. The significance\n    of the\
          \ co-occurrences is computed using the hypergeometric function.\n\n    This\
          \ option is distinct from the CRER detection. Motif co-occurrences\n   \
          \ typically applies to the analysis of large number of small sequences\n\
          \    (e.g. all the promoters of a gien microbe), in order to detect pairs\
          \ of\n    transcription factors whose putative target genes show a significant\n\
          \    overlap.\n\n"

          \   Given a list of input genes, infer the operon to which each of these\n\
          \    genes belong.\n\n    The inferrence is based on a \e[1mvery\e[0m simplistic\
          \ distance-based method,\n    inspired from the method developed by Salgado,\
          \ Moreno et al. (Proc Natl\n    Acad Sci U S A. 2000;97:6652-7). The Salgado-Moreno\
          \ method classifies\n    intergenic distances as TUB (transcription unit\
          \ border) or OP (inside\n    operon), and infers operons by iteratively\
          \ collecting genes until a TUB\n    is found. In the original method, the\
          \ TUB or OP assignation relies on a\n    log-likelihood score calculated\
          \ from a training set.\n\n    The difference is that we do not use the log-likelihood\
          \ (which presents\n    risks of over-fitting), but a simple threshold on\
          \ distance. Thus, we\n    infer that the region upstream of a gene is TUB\
          \ if its size is larger\n    than a given distance threshold, and OP otherwise.\
          \ Our validations\n    (Rekins' Janky and Jacques van Helden, unpublished\
          \ results) show that a\n    simple threshold on distance raises a similar\
          \ accuracy as the\n    log-likelihood score (Acc ~ 78% for a threshold t=55).\n\

          [0m\n    genomics\n\n\e[1mMETHOD\e[0m\n    The method relies on three simple\
          \ rules, depending on the relative\n    orientation of the adjacent genes.\n\
          \n    Rule 1: divergently transcribed genes\n        If the gene found upstream\
          \ of a query gene is transcribed in the\n        opposite direction, then\
          \ the intergenic region is considered as a\n        TUB, and the two flanking\
          \ genes are labelled as operon leaders. This\n        prediction is reliable\
          \ (as far as genome annotation is correct),\n        since operons only\
          \ contain genes on the same strand.\n\n    Rule 2: convergently transcribed\
          \ genes\n        If the gene found downstream of a query gene is transcribed\
          \ in the\n        opposite direction, then the intergenic region is considered\
          \ as a\n        TUB, and the two flanking genes are labelled as operon trailers.\n\
          \        This prediction is reliable (as far as genome annotation is\n \
          \       correct), since operons only contain genes on the same strand.\n\
          \n    Rule 3: tandem genes (adjacent genes on the same strand)\n       \
          \ If two adjacent genes are on the same strand, then a distance\n      \
          \  threshold (option -dist) is applied to decide whether they belong to\n\
          \        the same operon (dist <= thredhold) or not (dist > threshold).\
          \ If\n        they are predicted to be in distinct operon, the upstream\
          \ gene is\n        labelled as operon trailer, and the downstream gene as\

          When this option is active, the sequence size is\n\t\tadapted to avoid including\
          \ coding sequences of the\n\t\tneighbour genes.\n\n\t\tThe reason for preventing\
          \ overlap with upstream genes\n\t\tis that (at least for microbial organisms,\
          \ and in\n\t\tlarge part for higher eukaryotes) most cis-acting\n\t\telements\
          \ are located in the non-coding regions. Thus,\n\t\tif the neighbour gene\
          \ is closer than the selected\n\t\tlimit for collecting upstream sequences,\
          \ the part of\n\t\tcoding sequences included it the result is likely to\n\
          \t\tadd up to the noise, without bringing any additional\n\t\tsignal.\n\n\
          \t\tMore importantly, coding and non-coding sequences\n\t\tgenerally have\
          \ very different background models. The\n\t\tinclusion of coding sequences\
          \ from neighbour genes may\n\t\tthus lead to biases in motif discovery.\n\
          \n\t\tThe weaknesses of using this option are that, in some\n\t\tcases,\
          \ predicted orf do not correspond to real genes,\n\t\tThis was particularly\
          \ frequent in the early versions\n\t\tof the yeast genome, but the annotations\
          \ have been\n\t\timproved since then.\n\n\t\tFor bacterial sequences, it\
          \ is essential to prevent\n\t\toverlap with upstream genes, because intergenic\n\
          \t\tdistances are often very short, especially between\n\t\tpairs of genes\
          \ comprised in the same operon.\n\n\n\t-rm     Use the repeat masked version\
          \ of the genome.  Attention :\n\t\trepeated regions are annotated for some\
          \ genomes only.\n\n\t-nocom\tno comments. Only the identifier and the sequence\
          \ are\n\t\treturned. By default, the comment indicates the ORF and\n\t\t\
          upstream sequence coordinates.\n\n\t-imp_pos\n\t\tAdmit imprecise positions.\n\
          \t\tIn the annotation of some genomes, the limits of some genes\n\t    \
          \    are imprecisely specified (e.g. <555245, >898098). By default,\n\t\
          \        these genes are not loaded. The option -imp_pos allows to\n\t \

          [0m or \e[33mdyad-analysis\e[0m) or an assembly made of such\n    patterns\
          \ (output of \e[33mpattern-assembly\e[0m).\n\n    The program proceeds in\
          \ two steps:\n\n    1) A \e[1msignificance matrix\e[0m is built by assembling\
          \ the patterns (with\n    \e[33mpattern assembly\e[0m), and converting each\
          \ assembly to a position-specific\n    scoring matrix (the conversion is\
          \ ensured by \e[33mconvert-matrix\e[0m). This\n    significance matrix contains\
          \ one row per residue, one column per\n    position of the pattern assembly,\
          \ and each cell indicates the maximal\n    significance value observed for\
          \ a given residue at a given position in\n    the assembly.\n\n    2) The\
          \ significance matrix is then used as seed for collecting a PSSSM\n    from\
          \ the input sequences. The matrix is collected either with\n    \e[33minfo-gibbs\e\
          [0m (since Nov 2009) or with \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m (slow and obsolete).\n\
          \n    Advantage of this two-step process: classically, position-specific\n\
          \    scoring matrices are build from an alignemnt of sites (e.g. binding\n\
          \    sites for a transcription factor). A significance matrix already gives\
          \ a\n    good indication of the motif, but it does not always reflect the\
          \ real\n    sites present in the sequence, because it is built by assembling\n\
          \    overlapping oligonucleotides (or dyads), irrespective of the fact that\n\
          \    these patterns are found together or not in the input sequence.\n\n\
          \    The program \e[33mmatrix-from-pattern\e[0m solves this problem by using\
          \ the\n    assembled patterns as seeds to perform a matrix-based scanning\
          \ of the\n    input sequences, and collect the most likely instances of\
          \ the motif\n    (putative sites). These sites are then used to build an\
          \ count matrix,\n    reflecting the absolute residue frequencies at each\
          \ position of the\n    collected sites.\n\n    Weakness of this approach:\
          \ the scanning step can be time-consuming when\n    the input sequences\
          \ are large (e.g. for whole-genome motif detection).\n\n\e[1mAUTHORS\e[0m\n\

          \nDESCRIPTION\n\tDetects overrepresented dyads (spaced pairs) in a set of\
          \ DNA\n\tsequences. A dyad is defined here as a pair of\n\toligonucleotides\
          \ of the same size separated by a fixed number\n\tof bases.\n\n\tThis algorithm\
          \ is able to detect binding sites that escape detection by\n\toligo-analysis,\
          \ because of the sequence degeneracy within the spacer\n\tregion. A typical\
          \ example of patterns that are efficiently detected by\n\tthe dyad analysis\
          \ is the binding site for the yeast Gal4p\n\ttranscription factor, which\
          \ has the consensus CGGNNNNNWNNNNNCCG.\n\n\tThe dyad-analysis is generally\
          \ efficient to detect binding sites\n\tfor HTH factors from E.coli, and\
          \ for C6 Zinc cluster proteins in yeast.\n\nCATEGORY\n\tstatistics\n\tsequences\n\

          \n        Note that when searches are performed on both strands, NPO is\n\
          \        corrected for the fact that non-palindromic patterns are\n    \
          \    grouped by pairs (for example, there are 4096 possible\n        hexanucleotides\
          \ when the count is performed on a single\n        strand, but only 2080\
          \ when the count is performed on both\n        strands).\n\n\tInterpretation:\
          \ the E-value (Eval) represents the expected\n\tnumber of false positives,\
          \ for a given threshold of P-value\n\t(Pval). \n\n    SIGNIFICANCE INDEX\n\
          \n        The significance index is simply a negative logarithm\n      \
          \  conversion of the E-value (in base 10).\n\n\tThe significance index is\
          \ calculated as follows:\n\n\t      sig = -log10(E-value);\n\n\tThis index\
          \ is very convenient to interpret : higher values\n\tcorrespond to exceptional\
          \ patterns. A significance of 0\n\tcorresponds to an E-value of 1. A significance\
          \ of 2 to an\n\tE-value of 1e-2 (i.e. one expects no more than 0.01 false\n\
          \tpositives in the whole collection of patterns).\n\nAVAILABILITY\n    \
          \  The program can be used through its web interface at:\n      http://rsat.bigre.ulb.ac.be/rsat/\n\
          \n      dyad-analysis is a perl script running on unix machines (SUN,\n\
          \      SGI, DEC Alpha, Max OSX have been tested). The web interface is\n\
          \      a perl-cgi script.\n\n"

          \ and paralogy predictions are generated by\n    a pipeline where maximum\
          \ likelihood phylogenetic gene trees play a\n    central role. They attempt\
          \ to represent the evolutionary history of gene\n    families, i.e. genes\
          \ that diverged from a common ancestor. These gene\n    trees reconciled\
          \ with their species tree have their internal nodes\n    annotated to distinguish\
          \ duplication or speciation events, and thus\n    support the annotation\
          \ of orthologous and paralagous genes, which can be\n    part of complex\
          \ one-to-many and many-to-many relations.\n\n    Pairs of homologous sequences\
          \ are scored in terms of % amino acid\n    identity, which is calculated\
          \ with respect to query and target in order\n    to capture length and possibly\
          \ domain content differentes. For example,\n    if the species selected\
          \ is Arabidopsis thaliana, and the homologue is in\n    maize, the query\
          \ sequence is the A.thaliana protein and the target is\n    the maize protein.\
          \ \e[33mident_query\e[0m in this case is the % of the query\n    identical\
          \ to the maize protein, and \e[33mident_target\e[0m is the % of the maize\n\
          \    protein identical to the A.thaliana protein. These % identities will\n\
          \    only be the same if the length (number of amino acids) of both sequences\n\
          \    are the same.\n\n    [Adapted from:\n    <http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/compara/homology_method.html>].\n\

          \ organism_name\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\tInstall one or several organisms on the\
          \ local RSAT instance.\n\n\tThis script is a task manager, which (depending\
          \ on the\n\tselected tasks) manages different steps necessary for the\n\t\
          installation of an organism from the NCBI flat files:\n\n\t- Downloading\
          \ genomes from the NCBI/Refseq ftp site via the\n          rsync protocol\n\
          \          (rsync://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq).\n\n\t- Parsing\
          \ the .gbff files (Genbank-formatted flat files).\n\n\t- Adding the organism\
          \ in the config file.\n\n\t- Calculating trinucleotide frequencies in the\
          \ start and stop\n          codons (a way to check consistency of the gene\
          \ locations).\n\n\t- Calculating oligonucleotide and dyad frequencies, which\
          \ will\n          be used as background models for motif discovery.\n\n\

          \t-v\tverbose\n\n    MANDATORY ARGUMENTS\n\n    \tThe only mandatory option\
          \ is to specify one or more\n    \torganism(s) to be installed. This can\
          \ be done with any of the\n    \tfollowing options: -org, -org_file, -all_organisms,\
          \ -taxon.\n\n\t-org\torganism name without spaces (e.g. Saccharomyces_cerevisiae)\n\
          \n\t\tThe option -org can be used iteratively on the same\n\t\tcommand line\
          \ to iterate the installation over multiple\n\t\torganisms.\n\n        -org_file\
          \ organism_file_name\n\t\tText file containing a list of organisms to install.\n\
          \t\tThe first word of each row is taken as a query\n\t\torgnanism. Further\
          \ information of the same row is\n\t\tignored.\n\n\t-all_organisms\n\n\t\
          \tInstall all the organisms found in the Refseq\n\t\tdirectory (see option\
          \ -refseq).\n\n      \t-taxon  taxon name (mutually exclusive with -org)\n\
          \n\t\tThe installation will iterate over all organisms of\n\t\tthe selected\
          \ taxon. Note that the command will only\n\t\tapply to the organisms previously\
          \ declared with the\n\t\tcommand install-organism -task config. The option\n\
          \t\t-taxon is thus convenient for re-running installation\n\t\ttasks on\
          \ previously installed organisms rather than\n\t\tfor installing new genomes\
          \ downloaded e.g. from NCBI.\n\n\t\tThe option -taxon can be used iteratively\
          \ on the same\n\t\tcommand line to iterate the installation over multiple\n\
          \t\ttaxa.\n\n    SPECIFIC ARGUMENTS FOR THE DOWNLOAD AND PARSE TASK\n\n\
          \        -group taxonomic group according to the NCBI/Refseq ftp/rsync\n\
          \t       site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq). \n\n\t      \
          \ Examples: bacteria, fungi, protozoa, plant,\n\t       invertebrate, vertebrate_mammalian,\
          \ vertebrate_other\n\n\t-species species name, with space replaced by underscore\n\
          \t         (e.g. Saccharomyces_cerevisiae). \n\n\t\t Note that one species\
          \ may correspond to several\n\t         organisms if several strains are\
          \ available for this\n\t         species. In particular, for some bacteria\
          \ there are\n\t         several thousands of sequenced strains\n\t     \
          \    (e.g. Escherichia coli). \n\n\t\t The option -max_strains can be used\
          \ to restrict the\n\t         number of installed strains per species. \n\
          \n\t\t An alternative is to specify a custom list of species\n\t\t + strains\
          \ with the option -org_table (this is the\n\t\t recommended way to install\
          \ multiple genomes from\n\t\t NCBI).\n\n\t-species_file file containing\
          \ species names in the first\n\t        column.\n\n\t-max_strains #\n\n\t\
          \        Maximal number of strains per species to\n\t\tparse/install.  This\
          \ option avoids filling disk with\n\t\tparticular bacterial species for\
          \ which thousands of\n\t\tstrains have been sequenced (e.g. Escherichia\
          \ coli).\n\n\t-strain restrict the download to a single strain or\n    \
          \            assembly. By default all strains of the selected\n        \
          \        species are downloaded, but this can be heavy for some\n      \
          \          bacterial species where thousands of strains have been\n    \
          \            sequenced (e.g. Escherichia coli).\n\n\t      Note: the RSAT\
          \ organism name is automatically built by\n\t      concatenating the NCBI\
          \ species name and strain\n\t      identifier.\n\n\t-assembly_table\n\n\t\
          \        Table extracted from the NCBI ftp site, indicating the\n\t    \
          \    organisms to install. \n\n\t\tExample: assembly table of fungi:\n\n\
          \t        ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/fungi/assembly_summary.txt\n\
          \n\t\tThe table can be the full table for a given group, or\n\t\ta custom\
          \ subset, which can be selected on some\n\t\tinformative fields of the assembly\
          \ table. \n\n                We recommend to select the subset of rows having\n\
          \t\teither \"Complete genome\" or \"Chromosome\" in the 12th\n\t\tcolumn\
          \ (\"assembly_level\"), and to add a filter on\n\t\t\"refseq_category\"\
          \ in order to select \"representative\n\t\tgenome\" or \"reference genome\"\
          . \n\n\t\tThe assembly table can also be filtered out manually\n\t\tin order\
          \ to select a custom subset of the available\n\t\tgenomes.\n\n\t-refseq\n\

          \tNormally, the refseq directory is specified by\n\t\tdefining a global\
          \ variable REFSEQ_DIR in the config\n\t\tfile. The option -refseq allows\
          \ to overwrite this\n\t\tvalue.\n\n\n    OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS\n\n\t-skip #\t\
          Skip the first # organisms of the list.\n\n\t        This option is convenient\
          \ to resume the installation\n\t        of a list of organisms, when it\
          \ has been interrupted.\n\n\t\tIt also allows to organize the installation\
          \ by chunks\n\t\tof organisms.\n\n\t-skip_species # skip the first # of\
          \ the list of NCBI species. \n\n\t        Note that one species can correspond\
          \ to several\n\t        organisms, if several strains have been sequenced.\n\
          \n\t-last #\tStop after the first # organisms of the list.\n\n\t\tThis option\
          \ can be used to organize the installation\n\t\tby chunks of organisms.\n\
          \n\t-last_species # Stop after the first # species of the NCBI\n\t     \
          \   list.\n\n\t-organism Full name of the organism (e.g. 'Saccharomyces\n\

          \ path.\n\n\t-batch run some tasks (for example the calibration of oligos\n\
          \t\tand dyads) in batch mode.  This options works on our\n\t\tlab cluster,\

          \ 5: extract fasta sequences for different types of genomic\n    regions,\
          \ and run some control tests (e.g. oligonucleotide\n    frequencies of start\
          \ and stop codons). With the option -batch, the\n    tasks are sent to a\
          \ job scheuler (qsub) in order to be executed in\n    parallel.\n\n\tinstall-organism\

          \ \n\t    -batch\n\n    Step 6: compute the oligomer frequency tables. In\
          \ batch mode, this\n    task can be done only after the previous job list\
          \ is finished,\n    because of the dependencies between the parallelized\
          \ tasks\n    (upstream sequences have to be computed before computing their\n\

          \tgenomes from a RSAT server. \n\n \tIf a genome is available on the RSAT\
          \ server, it is recommended\n\tto use download-genomes in order to obtain\

          \n\tUpper and lower case are considered equivalent.\n\n\tPatterns can either\
          \ be entered directly by the user, or listed\n\tin a file.\n\n        The\

          \ means \"GATAAG or GATTAG\" (equivalent to GATWAG).\n        - CGGN{11}CCG\
          \ means CGG followed by 10 N followed by CCG.\n        - GATAAGN{0,30}GATAAG\

          \n\traw\tThe input file must contain raw sequences without any\n       \
          \         comment or other text. Tabs (\\t), blank spaces and newline\n\
          \                characters (\\n) are accepted (they will be automatically\n\
          \                removed before analysis). The sequence must be terminated\
          \ by\n                a newline character.\n\n\tfilelist\n\t\tfile list.\
          \ Each line of the input file contains the\n\t\tname of a file containing\

          \tThe first non-comment line must be the sequence identifier\n\t\t(a single\
          \ word without spaces).\n\t\tThe sequence follows the identifier line identifier.\
          \ It can\n                include spaces, tabs or newlines, that will be\
          \ removed for\n                sequence analysis.\n                The end\

          \ CRITERIA\e[0m\n    \e[1mSemantic remark:\e[0m the appropriate criteria\
          \ for establishing \e[1morthology\e[0m or\n    \e[1mparalogy\e[0m relationship\
          \ require to reconciliate the species tree with the\n    molecular tree.\
          \ For practical reasons, we cannot do this for all the\n    species supported\
          \ in RSAT. Pragmatically, \e[33mget-orthologs\e[0m is thus based on\n  \
          \  a very rudimentary (but widely used) criterion to decide whether a gene\n\
          \    is or not ortholog: we run BLAST for all proteins of the query genome\n\
          \    against all proteins of the reference taxon, and maintain lists of\
          \ hits\n    in subdirectories $RSAT/data/genome/[Organism_name]/blast_hits.\n\
          \n    The program filters the matches of these tables depending on the\n\
          \    user-specified homology criteria and thresholds on all the fields.\n\
          \n    Actually, this program allows to retrieve supposed \e[1morthologs\e\
          [0m (options\n    \e[1m-type BBH\e[0m, and to some extent option \e[33m-type\

          \ paralog, depending on the parameters).\n\n    The first column indicates\
          \ the \"hit\" gene (the one identified by BLAST\n    as similar to the query),\
          \ the second column gives the reference organism\n    (the organism in which\
          \ the BLAST search was performed). The third column\n    inciates the ID\
          \ of the query gene.\n\n    Additional columns (percentage of identity,\

          \    single-column alignments). For this reasons, \e[33mNcor\e[0m generally\
          \ gives a\n    better estimation of motif similarity than \e[33mcor\e[0m,\
          \ and we recommend it as\n    similarity score.\n\n    Imposing a too stringent\
          \ lower threshold on Ncor may however reduce the\n    sensitivity, and in\
          \ particular prevent from detecting matches between\n    half-motifs (e.g.\
          \ in the case of dimeric transcription factor\n    recognizing composite\
          \ motifs).\n\n   Note\n    An alternative would be to use as normalizing\
          \ factor the length of the\n    alignment (w) relative to the length of\
          \ the shorter motif.\n\n     Ncor = cor * w / min(w1,w2)\n\n    This however\
          \ tends to favour matches between very short motifs (4-5\n    residues)\
          \ which cover only a fraction of the query motif.\n\n   Ncor1, Ncor2, NcorS\n\
          \    In addition to Ncor, we define separate normalized correlations relative\n\
          \    to w1 and w2 resp.\n\n    Ncor1 = cor * w / w1\n    Ncor2 = cor * w\
          \ / w2\n    NcorS = cor * w / min(w1, w2)\n        Normalize the correlation\
          \ by the alignemnt width (w) relative to the\n        width of the smallest\
          \ of the two aligned matrices. This may return\n        more suitable results\
          \ when matrices of different sizes are aligned\n        (e.g. small motif\
          \ included in a composite motif), but sometimes the\n        sub-motifs\
          \ will score better than the full motifs.\n\n  \e[1mCorrelation of the information\

          \n    The \e[33mIcor\e[0m score fixes a weakness of the \e[33mcor\e[0m score\
          \ and all other other\n    metrics above, which only take into account the\
          \ residue frequencies\n    whilst ignoring the background frequencies.\n\
          \n    A typical manifestation of this problem is that the \e[33mcor\e[0m\
          \ score\n    occasionally returns alignements between non-informative pieces\
          \ of the\n    matrices , which appear flat on the aligned logos. The reason\
          \ why\n    uninformative columns may have a good correlation is that, if\
          \ both\n    matrices have the same compositional bias (for example 30%A,\
          \ 20%C, 20%G\n    and 30%T), they will be correlated. Consequently, the\
          \ columns reflecting\n    the background will contribute to increase the\
          \ correlation coefficient.\n\n    The information content corrects this\
          \ bias by relativizing the matrix\n    frequencies with respect to the background\
          \ residue probaiblities.\n\n     I{i,j} = f{i,j} log (f{i,j}/p{j})\n\n \

          \       For a given pair of matrices (one from file1 and one from\n    \

          \ best\n            alignemnt between the two matrices. The \"best\" alignement\
          \ is the\n            combination of offset and strand (with the option\

          \ obtain a table\n            with pairwise comparison scores between each\
          \ pair of input\n            matrices. Since the hierarchical clustering\
          \ requires a table\n            with all scores defined, the score mode\

          \    Evaluate the quality of a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM),\
          \ by\n    comparing score distributions obtained with this matrix in various\n\
          \    sequence sets.\n\n    The most classical use of the program is to compare\
          \ score distributions\n    between \"positive\" sequences (e.g. true binding\
          \ sites for the considered\n    transcription factor) and \"negative\" sequences\
          \ (e.g. intergenic\n    sequences between convergently transcribed genes).\n\
          \n  \e[1mPositive set : annotated binding sites\e[0m\n    The typical positive\
          \ set is a collection of sites that have been shown\n    (with experimental\
          \ methods) to bind the transcription factor of\n    interest.\n\n  \e[1mMatrix\
          \ sites\e[0m\n    A particular case of postive control is to estimate the\
          \ distribution of\n    scores of the sites that served to build the matrix.\
          \ This however\n    provkes some bias (over-estimation of the scores), since\
          \ the matrix is\n    used to score the sites on which it was \"trained\"\
          . This bias can be\n    circumvented by applying a cross-validation.\n\n\
          \  \e[1mCross-validation\e[0m\n    An important bias of evaluation (and\
          \ a frequent trap in published\n    articles) can result from an over-fitting\
          \ of the matrix to the positive\n    set, in case one would use the same\
          \ sites for building the PSSM and for\n    evaluating it. To avoid this\
          \ bias, \e[33mmatrix-quality\e[0m supports two modes of\n    cross-validation\
          \ (CV):\n\n     1. Leave-one-out (LOO)\n     2. k-fold cross-validation\
          \ (kfold)\n\n    The cross-validation can only be performed when the matrix\
          \ is specified\n    in a format that includes both the matrix and the sites\
          \ (sequences) that\n    were used to build this matrix. This is the case\
          \ for matrices in MEME,\n    consensus, transfac and MotifSampler formats.\n\
          \n   k-fold cross-validation\n    The set of input sequence (matrix site\
          \ sequences) is partitionned into k\n    randomly selected subets of approx.\
          \ equal size (the number of sites is\n    not always an exact multiple of\
          \ k).\n\n    The program then iterates over the testing set in the following\
          \ way. All\n    the sites that are not part of the testing sets are used\
          \ as trianing\n    sites to build a partial matrix. The testing sites are\
          \ then scored with\n    this partial matrix.\n\n   Leave-One-Out (LOO) test\n\
          \    In LOO cross-validation mode, one sequence (the \"left-out sequence\"\
          ) is\n    temporarily discarded from the positive set, and the remaining\
          \ sequences\n    are used to build a matrix, which is then used to score\
          \ the left out\n    sequence. The process iterates over all the sequences\
          \ of the positive\n    set.\n\n    If the left-out sequence has one or more\
          \ \"twin\" (identical site) in the\n    positive set, they are also temporarily\
          \ excluded from the positive set\n    and not included in the matrix used\
          \ to score the left out sequence.\n\n   LOO or k-fold ?\n    The LOO is\
          \ actually a particular case of k-fold cross-validation, where\n    k equals\
          \ the total number of sites used to build the original matrix.\n    The\
          \ LOO is particularly adapted for matrices built from a very small\n   \
          \ number of sites (e.g. matrices built from a handful of well-documented\n\
          \    sites as usually found in transcription factor databases).\n\n    On\
          \ the contrary, the k-fold cross-validation is useful to save computing\n\
          \    time for matrices built from large collection of sites (e.g. thousands\n\
          \    of sites resulting from ChIP-seq experiments).\n\n  \e[1mNegative set\e\
          [0m\n    It is sometimes difficult to find a good negative set, i.e. a collection\n\
          \    of sequences which supposedly do not contain any binding site for the\n\
          \    transcription factor of interest.\n\n   Random selection of biological\
          \ sequences\n    One possibility is to select a random set of genome fragments\
          \ (e.g. use\n    \e[33mrandom-genes\e[0m to select promoters of 100 randomly\
          \ selected genes).\n    However, some of these randomly selected sequences\
          \ might contain\n    effective binding sites for the transcripton factor.\n\
          \n   Artificial sequences\n    Another possiblity is to generate artificial\
          \ sequences according to some\n    background model (uing \e[33mrandom-seq\e\
          [0m), but there is always a risk that for\n    model to be an over-simplification\
          \ of the real sequences.\n\n   Biological sequences scanned with column-permuted\
          \ matrices\n    Yet another approach to perform the negative test os to\
          \ scan biological\n    sequences (e.g. upstream regions of 100 randomly\
          \ picked genes) with\n    column-permuted matrices. The advantage of this\
          \ approach is that the\n    sequences are realistic, but the permuted matrices\
          \ hopefully do not\n    correspond to any actual motif, and their empirical\
          \ distribution\n    observed in the test sequences is thus supposed to fit\
          \ the theoretcial\n    distribution.\n\n    This approach may however pose\
          \ problem in the specific case of\n    weak-complexity motifs (e.g. CCGCCC,\
          \ AATTTT), since many permutations\n    will give motifs that are similar,\
          \ if not equal, to the original motif.\n\n\e[1mHOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM ?\e\
          [0m\n    Let us be frank, this program can do many things, but requires\
          \ a bit of\n    expertise. A good strategy to get familiar with its multiple\
          \ results is\n    to start runing the simplest possible analysis, and progressively\
          \ adding\n    the more advanced tasks.\n\n    We propose hereafter a step-by-step\
          \ schedule of utilization, where\n    subsequent tasks are progressively\
          \ added.\n\n    We assume here that the user disposes of a PSSM in a format\
          \ that\n    includes both the matrix and the aligned sites used to compute\
          \ the\n    matrix (e.g. MEME format). Beware, the sites actually incorporated\
          \ in\n    the matrix may differ frfom the collection of sites used as input\
          \ for\n    the matrix-building program. For instance, if you use MEME (with\
          \ the\n    option -zoops) to build a matrix from a collection of annotated\
          \ TFBS,\n    some sites may be incorporated in the matrix, and some other\
          \ skipped. We\n    use hereafter the expression \e[1m\"matrix sites\"\e\
          [0m to refer to the sites used\n    in the alignment from which the residues\
          \ frequencies of the matrix were\n    computed.\n\n  \e[1mComparing the\

          \n    This will produce the simplest possible analysis: computing the score\n\
          \    distribution of the matrix sites, and comparing it to the theoretical\n\
          \    distribution.\n\n    Beware: the score distribution of matrix sites\
          \ is fake. Indeed, those\n    are the very stes that were used to build\
          \ the matrix. Each site partly\n    contributed to the matrix scores (weights)\
          \ that will serve to score it.\n    There is thus a problem of over-fitting:\
          \ we train a matrix with some\n    data, and we evaluate the matrix with\
          \ the same data.\n\n  \e[1mAssessing matrix sites with a Leave-One-Out (LOO)\
          \ procedure\e[0m\n    To circumvent the problem of over-fitting mentioned\
          \ above, we have need\n    to perform the Leave-One-Out (LOO) procedure.\
          \ Actually, \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m\n    automatically runs the leave-one-out\
          \ test by default. The reason why it\n    was not done in the previous section\
          \ is because we used the option\n    -no_cv, for the only purpose of illustrating\
          \ the problem of overfitting.\n    We will now run \e[33mmatrix-scan\e[0m\
          \ in the normal way, without inactivating the\n    LOO procedure.\n\n  \

          \ we propose a method that relies on\n    the combined analysis of theoretical\
          \ and empirical score distributions\n    in positive and negative control\
          \ sets.\n\n    \e[1mmatrix-quality\e[0m computes the theoretical distribution\
          \ of scores for a\n    PSSM, and compares it to several empirical distributions\
          \ obtained from\n    various sequence sets.\n\n    There might be several\
          \ PSSMs capable to detect similar binding motifs,\n    we can measure their\
          \ quality independently, althougth we would like to\n    detect the one\

          \ [-v]\n\n\e[1mINPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n    The default input format is .ft (the\
          \ same as for feature-map). Other\n    formats are also supported ($supported_input_formats).\n\
          \n  \e[1mFeature format\e[0m\n    Each feature is represented by a single\
          \ line, which should provide the\n    following information:\n\n    Input\
          \ file columns:\n\n    1. map label (eg gene name)\n    2. feature type\n\
          \    3. feature identifier (ex: GATAbox, Abf1_site)\n    4. strand (D for\
          \ Direct, R for Reverse),\n    5. feature start position\n    6. feature\
          \ end position\n    7. (optional) description\n    8. (optional) score\n\
          \n    The standard input format assumes that these topics are provided in\
          \ this\n    order, separated by tabs. Start and end positions can be positive\
          \ or\n    negative.\n\n\e[1mOUTPUT TYPES\e[0m\n  \e[1minter\e[0m\n    Intersections\
          \ between features (pairwise comparisons). For each\n    intersection between\
          \ two features, a feature of type \"inter\" is created.\n\n    The ID of\
          \ an \"inter\" feature indicates the files to which the\n    intersecting\
          \ features belong. For example \"f1.and.f3\" means that the\n    intersection\
          \ feture was obtained from a feature of the first input file\n    and a\
          \ feature of the second input file.\n\n  \e[1mdiff\e[0m\n    Pairwise differences\
          \ between files. For each pair of file, a feature of\n    type \"diff\"\
          \ is created.\n\n    The ID of the \"diff\" feature indicates the number\
          \ of the files\n    containing and not containing the feature, respezctively.\
          \ For example,\n    the ID \"f1.not.f3\" indictaes a feature found in file\
          \ 1 and without any\n    intersection with features oof file 3.\n\n  \e\
          [1mstats\e[0m\n    Calculate statistics about the intersections between\
          \ features of each\n    pair of input file.\n\n\e[1mOUTPUT FORMAT\e[0m\n\
          \    The output depends on the return type(s), which can be specified with\n\
          \    the option -return.\n\n  \e[1minter,diff\e[0m\n    The intersection\
          \ and differences are reported as features. Different\n    output formats\
          \ can be specified with the option -oformat (supported:\n    $supported_output_formats).\n\
          \n  \e[1mstats\e[0m\n    Matching statistics are exported as tab-delimited\
          \ tables. Each row is\n    starting with a comment character ';', so that\

          [0m\n        The scoring scheme is the weight (see \e[33mmatrix-scan -h\e\
          [0m for more\n        details). We calculate in an exaustive way the probabilities\
          \ that\n        are associated to each score (weight) that can be obtained\
          \ from a\n        given PSSM.\n\n        For Bernoulli (Markov order 0)\
          \ background models, the distribution\n        of scores is computed with\
          \ the algorithm described by Bailey\n        (Bioinformatics, 1999).\n\n\
          \        For Markov background models with higher orders, we have extended\n\
          \        this algorithm to take into account the dependencies between\n\
          \        residues. For each iteration of the algorithm, weigths associated\
          \ to\n        all possible transitions are tagged with a prefix. Each residue\n\
          \        weight is calculated according to the prefix tag. The prefix\n\
          \        corresponds to a word of Markov order size that preceeds the\n\

          \ (Jacques.van-Helden@univ-amu.fr)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\tCalculates the positional\
          \ distribution of oligonucleotides in\n\ta set of sequences, and detects\
          \ those which significantly\n\tdiscard from a homogeneous repartition.\n\
          \nCATEGORY\n\tsequences\n\tpattern-discovery\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\n\n\
          \tThis programs takes a sequence set as input, and calculates\n\tthe number\
          \ of occurrences of each word in a set of\n\tnon-overlapping positional\
          \ windows. The window width (in\n\tnumber of residues) is specified with\
          \ the option -ci (window\n\tinterval).\n\n\tThe expected number of occurrences\
          \ per window is then computed\n\ton the basis of a model of homogeneous\
          \ repartition of the\n\toccurrences. Beware : homogeneous repartition does\
          \ not\n\tnecessarily mean \"flat\". Indeed, if the sequence set contains\n\
          \tsequences of unequal lengths, the number of sequence fragments\n\tvaries\
          \ from window to window.\n\n\tObserved and expected occurrences are compared\
          \ using the\n\tchi-squared formula:\n\n\t\tchisq = SUM_i ( (obs-exp)^2 /\
          \ exp )\n\n\twhere i is the window number.\n\n\tA P-value is calculated\
          \ for each word.\n\n\t  Pval = P(chisq >= x)\n\nUSAGE\n\tposition-analysis\
          \ [-i inputfile]  [-format input_format]\n                [-o outputfile]\

          \ or synthetic documentation\n\n\nOPTIONS\n\t-i inputfile\n\t\tif not specified,\
          \ the standard input is used.\n\t\tThis allows to place the command within\
          \ a pipe.\n\n\t-seqtype dna|any\n\t\t  Sequence type\n\n\t-last #\n\t  \
          \    Stop after # sequences (for quick testing)\n\n\t      The possibility\
          \ to limit the analysis to a few sequences\n\t      (e.g.50 of the input\
          \ file can be useful for fine-tuning\n\t      the options and ensuring that\
          \ the result will appear as\n\t      requested. Note that this option should\
          \ not be used for\n\t      the final analysis, since the significance drastically\n\
          \t      depends on the number of input sequences.\n\n\t-skip #\n\t     \
          \ Skip the first # sequences.\n\n\t-first #\n\n\t     First sequence to\
          \ analyze.\n\n\t     The option \"-first n\" has the same effect as \"-skip\
          \ x\",\n\t     where x = n-1.  These two somewhat redundant options\n\t\
          \     exist because in some cases it is easier to indicate the\n\t     first\
          \ sequences (e.g. for naming result files according\n\t     to the first\
          \ and last sequences analyzed).\n\n\t     The options -skip, -last, -first\
          \ and -seqnb are\n\t     convenient for analyzing successive slices of at\n\
          \t     different depths in the sequence file (e.g. from 1 to\n\t     1000,\
          \ then from 5001 to 6000, then from 10001 to 11000,\n\t     etc). This allows\
          \ to test if the position bias of a\n\t     pattern is consistent over the\
          \ whole sequence file, or if\n\t     it is confined to the top sequences.\n\
          \n\t     An example of useful application of this slice-based\n\t     analysis\
          \ is to estimate the number of relevant sequences\n\t     in peaks returned\
          \ by applying peak-calling programs on\n\t     ChIP-seq reads.  Peak sequences\
          \ should be sorted by\n\t     decreasing score values.\n\n        -seqnb\
          \ #\n\n\t     Maximal number of sequences to analyze. The program stops\n\
          \t     reading the sequences after having reached this\n\t     number. This\

          \t\tGAT & TAG\n\t\t\t\tGATA & AG\n\t\t\t\tGATAA & G\n\n\t\tThe expected\

          \ and 1.\n\n\t\t This allows to circumvent the problem that the\n\t\t expected\
          \ frequency file might be incomplete (due to\n\t\t a too small reference\
          \ sequence set), in which case\n\t\t some oligonucleotides might have an\
          \ observed\n\t\t frequency > 0, whereas the expected frequency is 0\n\t\t\
          \ (leading to an impossible event). The expected\n\t\t frequency is corrected\
          \ by a pseudo-frequency, which\n\t\t is the pseudo-frequency divided by\

          \        x      T-x\n\t    P(X=x) = bin(p,T,x) =       T!      p  (1-p)\n\

          \             x! * (T-x)!\n\n\twhere   x   is the observed number of occurrences,\n\
          \                p   is the expected frequency for the pattern,\n      \
          \          T   is the number of possible matching positions,\n         \
          \           as defined above.\n\n\tThe probability to observe x or more\
          \ occurrences in the\n  \tsequence set is calculated by the sum of binomials:\n\
          \n\t                       T                 k-1\n\t    Pval = P(X>=x) =\
          \  SUM P(X=i) =  1 -  SUM  P(i)\n\t                      i=x           \
          \     i=0\n\n        Note that the the P-value (Pval) is not computed by\
          \ directly\n        applying this formula, but by using an efficient algorithm\n\
          \        (based on recursion), which increases both computing speed and\n\
          \        accuracy.\n\n        Interpretation: the P-value (Pval) represents\
          \ the nominal risk\n        of false positive, i.e. the risk to consider\
          \ a given word as\n        over-represented whereas it is not.\n\n\n   \
          \ OVER/UNDER-REPRESENTATION\n\n        By default, the program calculates\
          \ the P-value on the right\n\ttail of the probability distribution, which\
          \ represents the\n\tprobability to observe at least x occurrences by chance:\n\
          \n\t\t\t               T\n\t\t\t    P(X>=x) = SUM P(X=i)\n\t\t\t       \
          \       i=x\n\n\tWith the option -under, the P-value is calculated on the\
          \ left\n\ttail of the distribution, which represents the probability of\n\
          \thaving at most x occurrences:\n\n\t\t\t               x-1\n\t\t\t    P(X<=x)\
          \ =  SUM P(X=i)\n\t\t\t               i=0\n\n\tThe option -under does not\
          \ affect the other statistics\n\t(zscore, loglikelihood). For z-score, the\
          \ negative values\n\tindicate under-representation.\n\n\tWith the option\
          \ -two_tails, the P-value is calculated on\n\teither the left or the right-tail\
          \ of the distribution,\n\tdepending on the observed/expected comparison:\n\
          \t if k >= exp_occ, right tail (over-representation)\n\t if k < exp_occ,\
          \ left tail (under-representation)\n\n    SPECIFIC TREATMENT FOR DOUBLE\
          \ STRAND COUNTS\n\n\tWhen occurrences are counted on both strands, each\
          \ pattern is\n\tgrouped with its erverse complement.\n\n\tFor reverse-palindromic\
          \ patterns, probabilities are calculated\n\ton the basis of the single strand\
          \ count, since the occurrence\n\ton the reverse complement strand is completely\
          \ dependent on\n\tthat on the direct strand.\n\n        A more biological\
          \ justification for this is that, although the\n        word is foudn on\
          \ both strands in a string representation of\n        the sequences, at\
          \ the structural level, there is a single\n        binding site for the\
          \ factor.\n\n\n\tOn the contrary, for non-palindrommic patterns, occurrences\
          \ on\n        the direct and reverse complement strand represent distinct\n\
          \        binding sites. Thus,\n\n\t\t occ(W|Wr) = occ(W) + occ(Wr)\n\t\t\
          \ exp_freq(W|Wr) = exp_freq(W) + exp_freq(Wr)\n\n\t   where\n\t\t W    \
          \ is a given word\n\t\t Wr    is the reverse complement of W\n\n\tProbabilities\
          \ are then calculated as above, on the basis of\n\tthe event W|Wr instead\
          \ of simply W.\n\n    E-VALUE\n\n\tThe probability of occurrence by itself\
          \ is not fully\n\tinformative, because the threshold must be adapted depending\n\
          \ton the number of patterns considered. Indeed, a simple\n\thexanucleotide\
          \ analysis amounts to consider 4096\n\thypotheses.\n\n\tThe E-value (Eval)\
          \ represents the expected number of patterns\n\twhich would be returned\
          \ at random for a given threshold of\n\tnominal P-value.\n\n\t      Eval\
          \ = NPO * P(X>=x)\n\n\twhere NPO is the number of possible oligomers of\
          \ the chosen\n\t          length (eg 4096 for hexanucleotides).\n\n    \
          \    Note that when searches are performed on both strands, NPO is\n   \
          \     corrected for the fact that non-palindromic patterns are\n       \
          \ grouped by pairs (for example, there are 4096 possible\n        hexanucleotides\
          \ when the count is performed on a single\n        strand, but only 2080\
          \ when the count is performed on both\n        strands).\n\n\tInterpretation:\
          \ the E-value (Eval) represents the expected\n\tnumber of false positives,\
          \ for a given threshold of P-value\n\t(Pval). \n\n    SIGNIFICANCE INDEX\n\
          \n        The significance index is simply a negative logarithm\n      \
          \  conversion of the E-value (in base 10).\n\n\tThe significance index is\
          \ calculated as follows:\n\n\t      sig = -log10(E-value);\n\n\tThis index\
          \ is very convenient to interpret : higher values\n\tcorrespond to exceptional\
          \ patterns. A significance of 0\n\tcorresponds to an E-value of 1. A significance\
          \ of 2 to an\n\tE-value of 1e-2 (i.e. one expects no more than 0.01 false\n\
          \tpositives in the whole collection of patterns).\n\n    OVERLAP COEFFICIENT\n\
          \        overlap coefficient is calculated as follows\n        (after Pevzner\
          \ et al.(1989). J. Biomol. Struct & Dynamics\n        5:1013-1026):\n\n\t\
          \           l\n            Kov = SUM kj (1/4)^j\n                  j=1\n\
          \n        where l  is the pattern length.\n              j  is the overlap\
          \ position, comprised between 0 and l.\n              kj takes the value\
          \ 1 if there is an overlap at pos j,\n                 0 otherwise.\n\n\
          \        When counts are performed on both strands, overlaps between\n \
          \       the pattern and its reverse complement are also taken into account\n\
          \        into the same formula.\n\n    Z-SCORE\n\tThe Z-score is calculated\
          \ in the following way\n\n\t\tZsc = (obs_occ - exp_occ)/sd_occ\n\t     \
          \       = (obs_occ - exp_occ)/sqrt(var_occ)\n\n\twhere\n\t\tobs_occ\tis\
          \ the observed number of occurrences\n\t\texp_occ\tis the expected number\
          \ of occurrences\n\t\tsd_occ and var_occ\n                    are the estimated\
          \ standard deviation and variances\n                    for the occurrences,\
          \ respectively.\n\n\tThe estimation of the variance is derived from Pevzner\
          \ et al.(1989).\n\tJ Biomol Struct & Dynamics 5:1013-1026):\n\t\tvar_occ\
          \ = exp_occ(2*Kov - 1 - (2*w+1)*exp_freq)\n\n\tIn random sequences of *infinite*\
          \ size, occurrence counts tend\n\ttowards a normal distribution. This has\
          \ justified the use of\n\tZ-score in some publications, but it also presents\
          \ strong\n\tdisadvantages (see below). In short, you should generaly use\n\
          \tthe binomial proba (-return proba) rather than the Z-score.\n\n\tComparison\
          \ between the Z-score and the binomial probability\n\t-----------------------------------------------------------\n\
          \tI implemented the Z-score in 2000, for a particular article\n\t(analysis\
          \ of yeast downstream sequences) because at that time\n\tmy method for computing\
          \ binomial was slow (time was increasing\n\tquadratically with occurrence\
          \ number) and imprecise (precision\n\twas restricted to ~1e-15). In the\
          \ mean time, I implemented an\n\tefficient (linear) and precise (1e-300)\
          \ version of the\n\tbinomial, so that the Z-score does not present any advantage\n\
          \tanymore. It presents several flaws that are described below\n\tfor the\
          \ people who would like to know more about the choice of\n\ta scoring statistics.\n\
          \n\t- The use of Z-score statistics measures the distance between\n    \
          \      each observation and the mean of the population, in\n          standardized\
          \ units (i.e. counting the number of standard\n          deviations that\
          \ separates each observation from the mean).\n          \n\t- The Z-score\
          \ is commonly interpreted by converting Z values\n          to a P-values,\
          \ by reference to a Gaussian distribution. This\n          is however generally\
          \ NOT valid for word counts in\n          sequences. The Z-score has been\
          \ used in some publications to\n          detect over-represented words,\
          \ with the underlying\n          assumption that it provides a reasonable\
          \ approximation for\n          the binomial. This assumption is however\
          \ generally NOT\n          valid. The convergence of the binomial towards\
          \ the Gaussian\n          requires very large sequences (so that the expected\
          \ number\n          of occurrences for each word is >> 10). However, even\
          \ in the\n          cases where the sequences are very large (e.g. entire\n\
          \          genomes), the convergence between the binomial and Z-score\n\
          \          distributions concerns the center of the distribution, but\n\
          \          the tails remain well separated (you need to plot them on a\n\
          \          Y log graph to see this effect). And the problem is that,\n \
          \         when we detect over- or under-represented motifs, we are\n   \
          \       precisely considering the tails of the distribution, not its\n \
          \         center. Thus, the Z-score should generally be avoided.\n\n\t-\
          \ An advantage of the Z-score is that one can introduce two\n\t  separate\
          \ parameters for the mean and standard deviation,\n\t  which enables a correction\
          \ for the bias due to word\n\t  self-overlap (eg AAAAAA, TATATA). Self-overlap\
          \ of a word\n\t  provokes an aggregative dispersion, with a higher variance\n\
          \t  than the binomial/Poisson distributions. If uncorrected, the\n\t  increased\
          \ variance leads to an overestimation of the over-\n\t  and under-representation.\
          \ \n\n\t  Note that for the binomial statistics, the bias is corrected\n\
          \t  by using the option -noov (discard overlapping occurrences\n\t  of the\
          \ same word).\n\n\t- Its calculation is very fast.  This is especially critical\n\
          \t  when analyzing very big sequences (whole genomes), where the\n\t  expected\
          \ oligont occurrences are very high (binomial\n\t  calculation is slower\
          \ but not catastrophically so).\n\n\t- Z-score provides a way to detect\
          \ both over- and\n\t  under-represented patterns. Note that the binomial\n\
          \t  probability can also detect both over- and under-represented\n\t  motifs\
          \ (options -under and -two_tails).\n\n\t- Multitesting correction: The Z-score\
          \ can be misleading,\n  \t  because it has to be interpreted in terms of\n\
          \  \t  multi-tests. So, the same value of Z-score (say 5) can have\n  \t\
          \  very different E-values if you are considering 3-mers,\n  \t  5-mers\
          \ or 10-mers. With the binomial distribution, the\n  \t  program oligo-analysis\
          \ returns not only a P-value, but also\n  \t  an E-value (correction on\
          \ the P-value to account for\n  \t  multi-testing) and a sig index.\n\n\n\

          \ file (in bed\n    format). The program only takes into account the 3 first\
          \ columns of the\n    bed file, which specify the genomic coordinates. Additional\
          \ columns are\n    ignored.\n\n    The definition of the BED format is provided\
          \ on the UCSC Genome Browser\n    web site (http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1).\n\
          \n  \e[1mExample of bed coordinates\e[0m\n     chr1   3473041 3473370\n\

          \ 4846260\n\n  \e[1mInterpretation of bed coordinates\e[0m\n    \e[1mBeware\e\
          [0m: input bed files are expected to follow the UCSC convention:\n\n   \
          \ \e[33mzero-based coordinates\e[0m: coordinates start at 0, i.e. position\
          \ 0\n    corresponds to the first nucleotide of a contig, position i to\
          \ the\n    (i+1)th nucleotide.\n    \e[33msemi-open interval\e[0m: coordinates\
          \ are specified as semi-open interval\n    [start:end[. The interval thus\
          \ includes the start position, but not the\n    end position.\n\n    For\
          \ example, the following line in a bed file:\n\n     chr1   27 28\n\n  \
          \  corresponds to the interval [28,28[ i.e. the 28th nucleotide on\n   \
          \ chromosome 1.\n\n    1. chrom\n        The name of the chromosome (e.g.\
          \ chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or\n        scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671).\n\n\
          \    2. chromStart\n        The starting position of the feature in the\
          \ chromosome or scaffold,\n        specified according to the UCSC-specific\
          \ zero-based notation for the\n        start: the first position of a sequence\
          \ has coordinate 0.\n\n    3. chromEnd\n        The ending position of the\
          \ feature in the chromosome or scaffold,\n        according to UCSC convention\
          \ for bed files: zero-based specification\n        of the coordinates, but\
          \ the ending position is the first one <after>\n        the feature.\n\n\
          \        For example, a feature extending from positions 10 to 20 of the\n\
          \        sequence will have a chromStart of 9 (zero-based specification\
          \ of\n        the first position of the feature) and a chromEnd of 20 (zero-based\n\
          \        position of the first nucleotide after the feature).\n\n  \e[1mVariation\
