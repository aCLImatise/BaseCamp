  \nDESCRIPTION\n\tDetects overrepresented dyads (spaced pairs) in a set of DNA\n\t\
  sequences. A dyad is defined here as a pair of\n\toligonucleotides of the same size\
  \ separated by a fixed number\n\tof bases.\n\n\tThis algorithm is able to detect\
  \ binding sites that escape detection by\n\toligo-analysis, because of the sequence\
  \ degeneracy within the spacer\n\tregion. A typical example of patterns that are\
  \ efficiently detected by\n\tthe dyad analysis is the binding site for the yeast\
  \ Gal4p\n\ttranscription factor, which has the consensus CGGNNNNNWNNNNNCCG.\n\n\t\
  The dyad-analysis is generally efficient to detect binding sites\n\tfor HTH factors\
  \ from E.coli, and for C6 Zinc cluster proteins in yeast.\n\nCATEGORY\n\tstatistics\n\

  Various calibration models can be used to estimate the probability of\n\teach oligonucleotide\
  \ (see above). From there, and expected number of\n\toccurrences is calculated and\

  \ OF THE OBSERVED NUMBER OF OCCURRENCES\n        The probability to observe exactly\

  \ number of dyad occurrences,\n                p   is the expected dyad frequency,\n\
  \                T   is the number of possible matching positions,\n           \
  \         as defined above.\n\n        The probability to observe obs or more occurrences\
  \ in the\n        whole set of of sequences is calculated by the sum of\n      \
  \  binomials:\n\n                            x-1\n             P(X>=x) =  1 - SUM\
  \ P(j)\n                            j=0\n\n\n        Note that the the P-value (Pval)\
  \ is not computed by directly\n        applying this formula, but by using an efficient\
  \ algorithm\n        (based on recursion), which increases both computing speed\
  \ and\n        accuracy.\n\n        Interpretation: the P-value (Pval) represents\
  \ the nominal risk\n        of false positive, i.e. the risk to consider a given\
  \ dyad as\n        over-represented whereas it is not.\n\n    OVER/UNDER-REPRESENTATION\n\
  \n        By default, the program calculates the P-value on the right\n\ttail of\
  \ the probability distribution, which represents the\n\tprobability to observe at\
  \ least x occurrences by chance:\n\n\t\t\t               T\n\t\t\t    P(X>=x) =\
  \ SUM P(X=i)\n\t\t\t              i=x\n\n\tWith the option -under, the P-value is\
  \ calculated on the left\n\ttail of the distribution, which represents the probability\
  \ of\n\thaving at most x occurrences:\n\n\t\t\t               x-1\n\t\t\t    P(X<=x)\
  \ =  SUM P(X=i)\n\t\t\t               i=0\n\n\tThe option -under does not affect\
  \ the other statistics\n\t(zscore, loglikelihood). For z-score, the negative values\n\
  \tindicate under-representation.\n\n\tWith the option -two_tails, the P-value is\
  \ calculated on\n\teither the left or the right-tail of the distribution,\n\tdepending\
  \ on the observed/expected comparison:\n\t if k >= exp_occ, right tail (over-representation)\n\
  \t if k < exp_occ, left tail (under-representation)\n\n\n    E-VALUE\n\n\tThe probability\
  \ of occurrence by itself is not fully\n\tinformative, because the threshold must\
  \ be adapted depending\n\ton the number of patterns considered. Indeed, a simple\n\
  \thexanucleotide analysis amounts to consider 4096\n\thypotheses.\n\n\tThe E-value\
  \ (Eval) represents the expected number of patterns\n\twhich would be returned at\
  \ random for a given threshold of\n\tnominal P-value.\n\n\t      Eval = NPO * P(X>=x)\n\
  \n\twhere NPO is the number of possible oligomers of the chosen\n\t          length\
  \ (eg 4096 for hexanucleotides).\n\n        Note that when searches are performed\
  \ on both strands, NPO is\n        corrected for the fact that non-palindromic patterns\
  \ are\n        grouped by pairs (for example, there are 4096 possible\n        hexanucleotides\
  \ when the count is performed on a single\n        strand, but only 2080 when the\
  \ count is performed on both\n        strands).\n\n\tInterpretation: the E-value\
  \ (Eval) represents the expected\n\tnumber of false positives, for a given threshold\
  \ of P-value\n\t(Pval). \n\n    SIGNIFICANCE INDEX\n\n        The significance index\
  \ is simply a negative logarithm\n        conversion of the E-value (in base 10).\n\
  \n\tThe significance index is calculated as follows:\n\n\t      sig = -log10(E-value);\n\
  \n\tThis index is very convenient to interpret : higher values\n\tcorrespond to\
  \ exceptional patterns. A significance of 0\n\tcorresponds to an E-value of 1. A\
  \ significance of 2 to an\n\tE-value of 1e-2 (i.e. one expects no more than 0.01\
  \ false\n\tpositives in the whole collection of patterns).\n\nAVAILABILITY\n   \
  \   The program can be used through its web interface at:\n      http://rsat.bigre.ulb.ac.be/rsat/\n\
  \n      dyad-analysis is a perl script running on unix machines (SUN,\n      SGI,\
  \ DEC Alpha, Max OSX have been tested). The web interface is\n      a perl-cgi script.\n\
