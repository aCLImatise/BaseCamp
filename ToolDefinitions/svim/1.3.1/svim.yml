            \                        (default: 900). SVIM clusters the SV signatures\
            \ using\n                        an hierarchical clustering approach and\
            \ a novel\n                        distance metric called \"span-position\
            \ distance\". Span-\n                        position distance is the\
            \ sum of two components, span\n                        distance and position\
            \ distance. The span distance is\n                        the difference\
            \ in lengths between signatures\n                        normalized by\
            \ the greater length and always lies in\n                        the interval\

            \                  of 900, the position distance will be 2. A smaller\n\
            \                        distance normalizer leads to a higher position\n\
            \                        distance and as a consequence increases the importance\n\
            \                        of the position distance in the span-position\
            \ distance\n                        relative to the span distance.\n \

            \               parameter because it determines the strictness of\n  \
            \                      clustering. Choosing a large value leads to fewer\

    \                        segments. If there is an unaligned read segment larger\n\

    \                        between both segments on the read. If the overlap\n \
    \                       between the two segments on the read is larger than\n\

    \                     distance metric called \"span-position distance\". Span-\n\
    \                        position distance is the sum of two components, span\n\
    \                        distance and position distance. The span distance is\n\
    \                        the difference in lengths between signatures\n      \
    \                  normalized by the greater length and always lies in\n     \
    \                   the interval [0,1]. The position distance is the\n       \
    \                 difference in position between signatures normalized\n     \
    \                   by the distance normalizer (this parameter). For a\n     \

    \                       of 900, the position distance will be 2. A smaller\n \
    \                       distance normalizer leads to a higher position\n     \
    \                   distance and as a consequence increases the importance\n \
    \                       of the position distance in the span-position distance\n\

    \ between SVs in a\n                        cluster (default: 0.3). This is the\
    \ most important\n                        parameter because it determines the\
    \ strictness of\n                        clustering. Choosing a large value leads\

    \                        by the signal-to-noise ratio in the input alignments.\n\
    \                        That means that more accurate reads and alignments\n\

    \                        inversions) from translocations which cannot be\n   \
    \                     distinguished from the alignment alone. Split read\n   \

    \                    either indicate a very long deletion (inversion) or a\n \
    \                       translocation breakpoint. SVIM calls a translocation\n\
    \                        breakpoint if the mapping distance is larger than this\n\
    \                        parameter and a deletion (or inversion) if it is\n  \

    \ SEGMENT_GAP_TOLERANCE\n                        Maximum tolerated gap between\
    \ adjacent alignment\n                        segments (default: 10). This parameter\
    \ applies to gaps\n                        on the reference and the read. Example:\
    \ Deletions are\n                        detected from two subsequent segments\
    \ of a split read\n                        that are mapped far apart from each\
    \ other on the\n                        reference. The segment gap tolerance determines\
    \ the\n                        maximum tolerated length of the read gap between\
    \ both\n                        segments. If there is an unaligned read segment\
    \ larger\n                        than this value between the two segments, no\
    \ deletion\n                        is called.\n  --segment_overlap_tolerance\
    \ SEGMENT_OVERLAP_TOLERANCE\n                        Maximum tolerated overlap\
    \ between adjacent alignment\n                        segments (default: 5). This\
    \ parameter applies to\n                        overlaps on the reference and\
    \ the read. Example:\n                        Deletions are detected from two\
    \ subsequent segments of\n                        a split read that are mapped\
    \ far apart from each other\n                        on the reference. The segment\
    \ overlap tolerance\n                        determines the maximum tolerated\
    \ length of an overlap\n                        between both segments on the read.\
    \ If the overlap\n                        between the two segments on the read\
    \ is larger than\n                        this value, no deletion is called.\n\
    \nCLUSTER:\n  --partition_max_distance PARTITION_MAX_DISTANCE\n              \
    \          Maximum distance in bp between SVs in a partition\n               \
    \         (default: 5000). Before clustering, the SV signatures\n            \
    \            are divided into coarse partitions. This parameter\n            \
    \            determines the maximum distance between two subsequent\n        \
    \                signatures in the same partition. If the distance\n         \
    \               between two subsequent signatures is larger than this\n      \
    \                  parameter, they are distributed into separate\n           \
    \             partitions.\n  --distance_normalizer DISTANCE_NORMALIZER\n     \
    \                   Distance normalizer used for span-position distance\n    \
    \                    (default: 900). SVIM clusters the SV signatures using\n \
    \                       an hierarchical clustering approach and a novel\n    \
    \                    distance metric called \"span-position distance\". Span-\n\
    \                        position distance is the sum of two components, span\n\
    \                        distance and position distance. The span distance is\n\
    \                        the difference in lengths between signatures\n      \
    \                  normalized by the greater length and always lies in\n     \
    \                   the interval [0,1]. The position distance is the\n       \
    \                 difference in position between signatures normalized\n     \
    \                   by the distance normalizer (this parameter). For a\n     \
    \                   position difference of 1.8kb and a distance normalizer\n \
    \                       of 900, the position distance will be 2. A smaller\n \
    \                       distance normalizer leads to a higher position\n     \
    \                   distance and as a consequence increases the importance\n \
    \                       of the position distance in the span-position distance\n\
    \                        relative to the span distance.\n  --cluster_max_distance\
    \ CLUSTER_MAX_DISTANCE\n                        Maximum span-position distance\
    \ between SVs in a\n                        cluster (default: 0.3). This is the\
    \ most important\n                        parameter because it determines the\
    \ strictness of\n                        clustering. Choosing a large value leads\
    \ to fewer but\n                        larger clusters with larger distances\
    \ between its\n                        members. Choosing a small value leads to\
    \ more but\n                        smaller clusters with smaller distances between\
    \ its\n                        members. This parameter determines the height of\
    \ the\n                        cut-off in the hierarchical clustering dendrogram.\n\

    \                        Depending on the score distribution among the SV\n  \
    \                      candidates, decreasing this value increases the\n     \
    \                   runtime. We recommend to choose a value close to the\n   \
