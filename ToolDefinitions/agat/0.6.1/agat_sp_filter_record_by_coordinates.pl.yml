  \n\nName:\n    agat_sp_filter_record_by_coordinates.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The\
  \ script aims to filter the records to keep only those contained\n    within coordinates\
  \ defined in an input csv file. A record can be a\n    feature or a set of features\
  \ with part-of relationships. By default we\n    keep records overlapping the coordinates.\
  \ The --exclude parameter allows\n    to keep only record fully contained within\
  \ the coordinates.\n\n    ! With default paramater, an exon out of the coordinates\
  \ can be kept if\n    the gene it is part of is overlaping the coordinates.\n\n\
  Usage:\n        agat_sp_filter_record_by_coordinates.pl --gff infile.gff --tsv coordinates.tsv\
  \ [ --output outfile ]\n        agat_sp_filter_record_by_coordinates.pl --help\n\

  \    -c, --coordinates, --tsv, -r or --ranges\n            String - tsv file containing\
  \ the coordinates. Coordinates must\n            be one per line. Each line must\
  \ contain 3 fields separated by a\n            tabulation. Field1 is the sequence\
  \ id Field2 is the start\n            coordinate (included) Field3 is the end coordinate\
  \ (included)\n\n    -e or --exclude\n            Select only the features fully\
  \ containined within the\n            coordinates, exclude the overlapping ones.\n\
  \n    -o or --output\n            Output GFF file. If no output file is specified,\
