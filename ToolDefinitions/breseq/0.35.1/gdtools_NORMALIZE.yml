  \            skip step that checks consistency of normalize using APPLY.\n\nCreates\
  \ a GD file of mutations that have been normalized to the input reference files.\
  \ \n\nThis process involves (1) converting AMP mutations of ≤50 bp to indels, (2)\
  \ shifting INS and DEL mutations to the highest coordinates possible, (3) adding\
  \ repeat_seq, repeat_length, repeat_ref_copies, and repeat_new_copies fields for\
  \ INS and DEL mutations that are in tandem sequence repeats of ≥5 bases in the reference\
  \ sequence, and (4) flagging SNP, INS, or DEL mutations with sizes ≤50 bp that are\
  \ within 20 bp of the ends of annotated mobile_element copies in the reference genome\
  \ with the field mobile_element_adjacent=1\n\nOptionally, assigns 'adjacent', 'mediated',\
  \ or 'between' tags to mutations within 20 bp of annotated repeat regions to indicate\
  \ these may be hotspots that experience elevated mutation rates. (They will be counted\
  \ separately from other mutations in gdtools COUNT). This process preserves any\
  \ previous versions of these tags. DEL mutations with a size < 50 bp near repeat_regions\
  \ are treated as 'adjacent' rather than 'mediated'.\n\nImportant: the 'adjacent',\
  \ 'mediated', or 'between' tags will be added based on the current genome sequence\
  \ when this mutation is applied. So they will consider new mobile element insertions\
  \ that are applied before a mutation, but not those that are applied after, for\
  \ example. The 'before' tag can be used to enforce a specific ordering of these\
  \ mutations so that the mobile element insertion occurs first.\n\nThe coordinates\
  \ of DEL mutations that have 'mediated' or 'between' tags are NOT shifted, so that\
  \ they will remain adjacent to any relevant mobile elements or repeats.\n\nAny mutations\
  \ including 'no_normalize=1' in their definition will not be normalized.\n\n"
