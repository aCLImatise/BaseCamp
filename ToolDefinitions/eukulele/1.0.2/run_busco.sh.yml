  \ has been removed from Biopython. In many cases, the alphabet can simply be ignored\

  \ as an annotation on a SeqRecord for your script to work correctly. Please see\
  \ https://biopython.org/wiki/Alphabet for more information.\nThere was a problem\
  \ installing BUSCO or importing one of its dependencies. See the user guide and\
  \ the GitLab issue board (https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/issues) if you need further\
  \ assistance.\n"
