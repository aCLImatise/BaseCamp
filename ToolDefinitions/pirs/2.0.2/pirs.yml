                    \npIRS is a program for simulating paired-end reads from a genome.\
                    \  It is\noptimized for simulating reads from the Illumina platform.\
                    \  The input to\npIRS is any number of reference sequences. Typically\
                    \ you would just provide\none FASTA file containing your reference\
                    \ sequence, but you may provide two\nif you have generated a diploid\
                    \ sequence with `pirs diploid', or if you have\nchromosomes split\
                    \ up into multiple FASTA files.  The output of pIRS is two\nFASTQ\
                    \ files containing the simulated paired-end reads, as well as\
                    \ several log\nfiles.\n\nInput sequences are assumed to be haploid.\
                    \  If you instead want to simulate\nreads from a diploid genome,\
                    \ you must give the --diploid option so that\nthe diploidy is\
                    \ taken into account when computing coverage.  If you do\nnot\
                    \ do this, you will get twice as many reads as you wanted.\n\n\
                    pIRS simulates a normally-distributed insert (fragment) length\
                    \ using the\nBox-muller method.  Usually you want the insert length\

                    \ mean (see the -m and -v options).\nThis program also simulates\
                    \ Illumina sequencing error, quality score and\nGC bias based\
                    \ on empirical distribution profiles. Users may use the default\n\

                pIRS is a program for simulating paired-end reads from a genome. \

            optimized for simulating reads from the Illumina platform.  The input\
            \ to\npIRS is any number of reference sequences. Typically you would just\

            \ may provide two\nif you have generated a diploid sequence with `pirs\
            \ diploid', or if you have\nchromosomes split up into multiple FASTA files.\
            \  The output of pIRS is two\nFASTQ files containing the simulated paired-end\
            \ reads, as well as several log\nfiles.\n\nInput sequences are assumed\
            \ to be haploid.  If you instead want to simulate\nreads from a diploid\
            \ genome, you must give the --diploid option so that\nthe diploidy is\
            \ taken into account when computing coverage.  If you do\nnot do this,\
            \ you will get twice as many reads as you wanted.\n\npIRS simulates a\
            \ normally-distributed insert (fragment) length using the\nBox-muller\
            \ method.  Usually you want the insert length standard deviation to\n\
            be 1/20 or 1/10 of the insert length mean (see the -m and -v options).\n\
            This program also simulates Illumina sequencing error, quality score and\n\
            GC bias based on empirical distribution profiles. Users may use the default\n\

        \          The \"dist\" algorithm looks up the substitution error rate\n \

        \                 base.  This lookup produces a quality score and a called\

        \  parameters.  The matrix used for this is marked as\n                 [QTransMatrix]\

    \ the form of SNPs, indels, and\nlarge-scale structural variation (insertions,\

  help_text: "Usage: ./pirs simulate [OPTION]... REFERENCE.FASTA...\n\npIRS is a program\
    \ for simulating paired-end reads from a genome.  It is\noptimized for simulating\
    \ reads from the Illumina platform.  The input to\npIRS is any number of reference\
    \ sequences. Typically you would just provide\none FASTA file containing your\
    \ reference sequence, but you may provide two\nif you have generated a diploid\
    \ sequence with `pirs diploid', or if you have\nchromosomes split up into multiple\
    \ FASTA files.  The output of pIRS is two\nFASTQ files containing the simulated\
    \ paired-end reads, as well as several log\nfiles.\n\nInput sequences are assumed\
    \ to be haploid.  If you instead want to simulate\nreads from a diploid genome,\
    \ you must give the --diploid option so that\nthe diploidy is taken into account\
    \ when computing coverage.  If you do\nnot do this, you will get twice as many\
    \ reads as you wanted.\n\npIRS simulates a normally-distributed insert (fragment)\
    \ length using the\nBox-muller method.  Usually you want the insert length standard\
    \ deviation to\nbe 1/20 or 1/10 of the insert length mean (see the -m and -v options).\n\
    This program also simulates Illumina sequencing error, quality score and\nGC bias\
    \ based on empirical distribution profiles. Users may use the default\nprofiles\
