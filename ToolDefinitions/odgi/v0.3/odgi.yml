  \ and manipulation of paths\n  -- prune         prune the graph based on coverage\
  \ or topological complexity\n  -- simplify      merge unbranching linear components\
  \ into single nodes\n  -- subset        extract subsets of the graph as defined\
  \ by query criteria\n  -- bin           bin path information across the graph\n\
  \  -- matrix        graph topology in sparse matrix form\n  -- chop          chop\
  \ long nodes into short ones while preserving topology\n  -- layout        use SGD\
