help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified November 8, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Realigns mapped reads to a reference.\n\nUsage:  bbrealign.sh in=<file> ref=<file>\
  \ out=<file>\n\nInput may be a sorted or unsorted sam or bam file.\nThe reference\
  \ should be fasta.\n\nI/O parameters:\nin=<file>       Input reads.\nout=<file>\
  \      Output reads.\nref=<file>      Reference fasta.\noverwrite=f     (ow) Set\
  \ to false to force the program to abort rather than\n                overwrite\
  \ an existing file.\n\nTrimming parameters:\nborder=0        Trim at least this\
  \ many bases on both ends of reads.\nqtrim=r         Quality-trim reads on this\
  \ end\n                   r: right, l: left, rl: both, f: don't quality-trim.\n\
  trimq=10        Quality-trim bases below this score.\n\nRealignment parameters:\n\
  unclip=f        Convert clip symbols from exceeding the ends of the\n          \
  \      realignment zone into matches and substitutitions.\nrepadding=70    Pad alignment\
  \ by this much on each end.  Typically,\n                longer is more accurate\
  \ for long indels, but greatly\n                reduces speed.\nrerows=602     \
  \ Use this many rows maximum for realignment.  Reads longer\n                than\
  \ this cannot be realigned.\nrecols=2000     Reads may not be aligned to reference\
  \ seqments longer \n                than this.  Needs to be at least read length\
  \ plus\n                max deletion length plus twice padding.\nmsa=          \
  \  Select the aligner.  Options:\n                   MultiStateAligner11ts:    \
  \ Default.\n                   MultiStateAligner9PacBio:  Use for PacBio reads,\
  \ or for\n                   Illumina reads mapped to PacBio/Nanopore reads.\n\n\
  Sam-filtering parameters:\nminpos=         Ignore alignments not overlapping this\
  \ range.\nmaxpos=         Ignore alignments not overlapping this range.\nminreadmapq=4\
  \   Ignore alignments with lower mapq.\ncontigs=        Comma-delimited list of\
  \ contig names to include. These \n                should have no spaces, or underscores\
  \ instead of spaces.\nsecondary=f     Include secondary alignments.\nsupplimentary=f\
  \ Include supplimentary alignments.\ninvert=f        Invert sam filters.\n\nJava\
  \ Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n\
  \                -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n      \
  \          specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom\
  \           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n     \
  \           exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
