help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified November 9, 2016\n\nDescription:\
  \  Re-pairs reads that became disordered or had some mates eliminated.\nPlease read\
  \ bbmap/docs/guides/RepairGuide.txt for more information.\n\nUsage:  repair.sh in=<input\
  \ file> out=<pair output> outs=<singleton output>\n\nInput may be fasta, fastq,\
  \ or sam, compressed or uncompressed.\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>       The 'in='\
  \ flag is needed if the input file is not the first \n                parameter.\
  \  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard in.\nin2=<file>      Use this if 2nd read\
  \ of pairs are in a different file.\nout=<file>      The 'out=' flag is needed if\
  \ the output file is not the second\n                parameter.  'out=stdout' will\
  \ pipe to standard out.\nout2=<file>     Use this to write 2nd read of pairs to\
  \ a different file.\nouts=<file>     (outsingle) Write singleton reads here.\noverwrite=t\
  \     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than\n            \
  \    overwrite an existing file.\nshowspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display\
  \ of processing speed.\nziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to\
  \ change compression\n                level; lower compression is faster.\nfint=f\
  \          (fixinterleaving) Fixes corrupted interleaved files using read\n    \
  \            names.  Only use on files with broken interleaving - correctly\n  \
  \              interleaved files from which some reads were removed.\nrepair=t \
  \       (rp) Fixes arbitrarily corrupted paired reads by using read \n         \
  \       names.  Uses much more memory than 'fint' mode.\nain=f           (allowidenticalnames)\
  \ When detecting pair names, allows \n                identical names, instead of\
  \ requiring /1 and /2 or 1: and 2:\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will\
  \ set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will\
  \ specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs. The\
  \ max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause\
  \ the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires\
  \ Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
