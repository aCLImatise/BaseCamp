  \nDescription:  Randomly adds adapters to a file, or grades a trimmed file.\nThe\
  \ input is a set of reads, paired or unpaired.\nThe output is those same reads with\
  \ adapter sequence replacing some of the bases in some reads.\nFor paired reads,\
  \ adapters are located in the same position in read1 and read2.\nThis is designed\
  \ for benchmarking adapter-trimming software, and evaluating methodology.\nrandomreads.sh\
  \ is better for paired reads, though, as it actually adds adapters at the correct\
  \ location,\nso that overlap may be used for adapter detection.\n\nUsage:  addadapters.sh\
  \ in=<file> in2=<file2> out=<outfile> out2=<outfile2> adapters=<file>\n\nin2 and\
  \ out2 are for paired reads and are optional.\nIf input is paired and there is only\
  \ one output file, it will be written interleaved.\n\nParameters:\now=f        \
  \        (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.\nint=f               (interleaved)\
  \ Determines whether INPUT file is considered interleaved.\nqin=auto           \
  \ ASCII offset for input quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina), or auto.\n\
  qout=auto           ASCII offset for output quality.  May be 33 (Sanger), 64 (Illumina),\
  \ or auto (same as input).\nadd                 Add adapters to input files.  Default\
  \ mode.\ngrade               Evaluate trimmed input files.\nadapters=<file>    \
  \ Fasta file of adapter sequences.\nliteral=<sequence>  Comma-delimited list of\
  \ adapter sequences.\nleft                Adapters are on the left (3') end of the\
  \ read.\nright               Adapters are on the right (5') end of the read.  Default\
  \ mode.\nadderrors=t         Add errors to adapters based on the quality scores.\n\
  addpaired=t         Add adapters to the same location for read 1 and read 2.\narc=f\
  \               Add reverse-complemented adapters as well as forward.\nrate=0.5\
  \            Add adapters to this fraction of reads.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
  \ at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
