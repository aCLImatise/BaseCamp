help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 3, 2016\n\nDescription:\
  \  Filters an assembly by contig coverage.\nThe coverage stats file can be generated\
  \ by BBMap or Pileup.\n\nUsage:  filterbycoverage.sh in=<assembly> cov=<coverage\
  \ stats> out=<filtered assembly> mincov=5\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>       File containing\
  \ input assembly.\ncov=<file>      File containing coverage stats generated by pileup.\n\
  cov0=<file>     Optional file containing coverage stats before normalization.\n\
  out=<file>      Destination of clean output assembly.\noutd=<file>     (outdirty)\
  \ Destination of dirty output containing only removed contigs.\nminc=5         \
  \ (mincov) Discard contigs with lower average coverage.\nminp=40         (minpercent)\
  \ Discard contigs with a lower percent covered bases.\nminr=0          (minreads)\
  \ Discard contigs with fewer mapped reads.\nminl=1          (minlength) Discard\
  \ contigs shorter than this (after trimming).\ntrim=0          (trimends) Trim the\
  \ first and last X bases of each sequence.\nratio=0         If cov0 is set, contigs\
  \ will not be removed unless the coverage ratio (of cov to cov0) is at least this\
  \ (0 disables it).\now=t            (overwrite) Overwrites files that already exist.\n\
  app=f           (append) Append to files that already exist.\nzl=4            (ziplevel)\
  \ Set compression level, 1 (low) to 9 (max).\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx         \
  \   This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n             \
  \   -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n \
  \                   The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom        \
  \   This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n             \
  \   exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
