help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified May 23, 2014\n\n*** DEPRECATED:\
  \ This should still work but is no longer maintained. ***\n\nDescription:  Annotates\
  \ reads with their kmer depth.\n\nUsage:        kmercoverage in=<input> out=<read\
  \ output> hist=<histogram output>\n\nInput parameters:\nin2=null            Second\
  \ input file for paired reads\nextra=null          Additional files to use for input\
  \ (generating hash table) but not for output\nfastareadlen=2^31   Break up FASTA\
  \ reads longer than this.  Can be useful when processing scaffolded genomes\ntablereads=-1\
  \       Use at most this many reads when building the hashtable (-1 means all)\n\
  kmersample=1        Process every nth kmer, and skip the rest\nreadsample=1    \
  \    Process every nth read, and skip the rest\n\nOutput parameters:\nhist=null\
  \           Specify a file to output the depth histogram\nhistlen=10000       Max\
  \ depth displayed on histogram\nreads=-1            Only process this number of\
  \ reads, then quit (-1 means all)\nsampleoutput=t      Use sampling on output as\
  \ well as input (not used if sample rates are 1)\nprintcoverage=f     Only print\
  \ coverage information instead of reads\nuseheader=f         Append coverage info\
  \ to the read's header\nminmedian=0         Don't output reads with median coverage\
  \ below this\nminaverage=0        Don't output reads with average coverage below\
  \ this\nzerobin=f           Set to true if you want kmers with a count of 0 to go\
  \ in the 0 bin instead of the 1 bin in histograms.\n                    Default\
  \ is false, to prevent confusion about how there can be 0-count kmers.\n       \
  \             The reason is that based on the 'minq' and 'minprob' settings, some\
  \ kmers may be excluded from the bloom filter.\n\nHashing parameters:\nk=31    \
  \            Kmer length (values under 32 are most efficient, but arbitrarily high\
  \ values are supported)\ncbits=8             Bits per cell in bloom filter; must\
  \ be 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.  Maximum kmer depth recorded is 2^cbits.\n            \
  \        Large values decrease accuracy for a fixed amount of memory.\nhashes=4\
  \            Number of times a kmer is hashed.  Higher is slower.\n            \
  \        Higher is MORE accurate if there is enough memory, and LESS accurate if\
  \ there is not enough memory.\nprefilter=f         True is slower, but generally\
  \ more accurate; filters out low-depth kmers from the main hashtable.\nprehashes=2\
  \         Number of hashes for prefilter.\npasses=1            More passes can sometimes\
  \ increase accuracy by iteratively removing low-depth kmers\nminq=7            \
  \  Ignore kmers containing bases with quality below this\nminprob=0.5         Ignore\
  \ kmers with overall probability of correctness below this\nthreads=X          \
  \ Spawn exactly X hashing threads (default is number of logical processors).  Total\
  \ active threads may exceed X by up to 4.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            \
  \    This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n            \
  \        -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n\
  \                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom       \
  \        This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory\
  \ exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\
