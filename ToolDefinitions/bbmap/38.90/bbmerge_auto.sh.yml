help_text: "\nbbmerge-auto.sh is a wrapper for BBMerge that attempts to use all available\n\
  memory, instead of a fixed amount.  This is for use with the Tadpole options\nof\
  \ error-correction (ecct) and extension, which require more memory.\nFor merging\
  \ by overlap only, please use bbmerge.sh.  If you set memory\nmanually with the\
  \ -Xmx flag, bbmerge.sh and bbmerge-auto.sh are equivalent.\n\nFor information about\
  \ usage and parameters, please run bbmerge.sh.\n\n"
