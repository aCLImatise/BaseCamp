  \nINPUT=File\nI=File                        The input SAM or BAM file to analyze.\
  \  Must be coordinate sorted.   Required. \n\nCOLLAPSE_TAG=String           Collapse\
  \ tags that are within , and have the same CONTEXT_TAGS.  For example, if your\n\
  \                              context tags were cell and gene, you could collapse\
  \ UMI tags.  Required. \n\nCONTEXT_TAGS=String           Group reads by these read\
  \ tags.  Collapse the COLLAPSE_TAG values that have the same\n                 \
  \             CONTEXT_TAGS values.  Reads with unset CONTEXT_TAGS that will be grouped\
  \ together and\n                              loaded into memory together.  This\
  \ can cause a large amount of memory usage if you pick a\n                     \
  \         lot of tags that are all mostly not set.  Default value: null. This option\
  \ must be\n                              specified at least 1 times. \n\nCOUNT_TAGS=String\
  \             By default, groups of reads are gathered by their CONTEXT_TAGS and\
  \ ordered by the number\n                              of total reads.  Contexts\
  \ with larger numbers of reads are potential 'parents' of smaller\n            \
  \                  context objects. If this option is used, the count of a context\
  \ to determine it's ordering\n                              is the unique count\
  \ of values of the TAG(S) added here.  For example, if you wanted to\n         \
  \                     collapse by UMI counts instead of read counts, you could put\
  \ the UMI tag here.  Default\n                              value: null. This option\
  \ may be specified 0 or more times. \n\nCOUNT_TAGS_EDIT_DISTANCE=Integer\n     \
  \                         If COUNT_TAGS is set and COUNT_TAGS_EDIT_DISTANCE>0, then\
  \ collapse the COUNT_TAGS in a\n                              CONTEXT by the given\
  \ edit distance.  For example, if you wanted to collapse by UMIs\n             \
  \                 instead of read counts, and you wanted to further collapse UMIs\
  \ by edit distance 1, you'd\n                              set COUNT_TAGS_EDIT_DISTANCE\
  \ to 1.  This doesn't do much unless MIN_COUNT is also set as\n                \
  \              collapse would only be affected if there is a minimum number of counts\
  \ for each CONTEXT to\n                              be in a COLLAPSE.  Default\
  \ value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default\n            \
  \                  value. \n\nOUT_TAG=String                The output tag for the\
  \ newly collapsed tag values  Required. \n\nOUTPUT=File\nO=File                \
  \        Output BAM file with the new collapsed tag.  Required. \n\nEDIT_DISTANCE=Integer\
  \         The edit distance to collapse tags.  If adaptive edit distance is used,\
  \ this is the\n                              default edit distance used if no adaptive\
  \ edit distance is discovered.  If mutational\n                              collapse\
  \ is used, this is the maximum edit distance two barcodes in a network can be apart\n\
  \                              (but they must have network neighbors at ED=1 for\
  \ the entire path).  Default value: 1.\n                              This option\
  \ can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nFIND_INDELS=Boolean     \
  \      Should indels be considered in edit distance calculations?  Doing this correctly\
  \ is far\n                              slower than a simple edit distance test,\
  \ but is a more aggressive method that may be\n                              useful\
  \ in some situations.  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to\n\
  \                              clear the default value. Possible values: {true,\
  \ false} \n\nREAD_MQ=Integer               Read quality filter.  Filters all reads\
  \ lower than this mapping quality.  Defaults to 10. \n                         \
  \     Set to 0 to not filter reads by map quality.  Default value: 10. This option\
  \ can be set to\n                              'null' to clear the default value.\
  \ \n\nMIN_COUNT=Integer             The minumum number of reads (unless using the\
  \ COUNT_TAGS option) for a context to be\n                              eligible\
  \ for collapse.  Must be >= 1.  Default value: 1. This option can be set to 'null'\n\
  \                              to clear the default value. \n\nDROP_SMALL_COUNTS=Boolean\
  \     When collapsing a CONTEXT_TAG, do not emit CONTEXT reads that have fewer than\
  \ MIN_COUNT\n                              counts.  For example, if your context\
  \ tags were cell and gene and you were collapsing UMI\n                        \
  \      tags and had a MIN_COUNT of 5, then cell/gene pairs with fewer than 5 UMIs\
  \ would not have\n                              their reads emiited in the output\
  \ BAM.  Default value: false. This option can be set to\n                      \
  \        'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false} \n\n\
  NUM_THREADS=Integer           Number of threads to use.  Defaults to 1.  Default\
  \ value: 1. This option can be set to\n                              'null' to clear\
  \ the default value. \n\nADAPTIVE_EDIT_DISTANCE=BooleanInstead of using the default\
  \ fixed edit distance, use an adaptive edit distance.  For each\n              \
  \                mergable entity, this tries to determine if there are 2 clusters\
  \ of data by edit distance,\n                              and only merge the close-by\
  \ neighbors.  Default value: false. This option can be set to\n                \
  \              'null' to clear the default value. Possible values: {true, false}\
  \ \n\nADAPTIVE_ED_MAX=Integer       If adaptive edit distance is used, this is the\
  \ maximum edit distance allowed.  Default\n                              value:\
  \ -1. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value. \n\nADAPTIVE_ED_MIN=Integer\
  \       If adaptive edit distance is used, this is the minimum edit distance allowed.\
  \  Default\n                              value: -1. This option can be set to 'null'\
  \ to clear the default value. \n\nADAPTIVE_ED_METRICS_FILE=File If provided, writes\
  \ out some metrics about each barcode that is merged by adaptive edit\n        \
  \                      distance collapse.  Default value: null. \n\nADAPTIVE_ED_METRICS_ED_LIST=Boolean\n\
  \                              If true, add an additional column that contains a\
  \ comma separated list of edit distances\n                              from the\
  \ current CONTEXT_TAG to all other CONTEXT_TAGS.  This will make files\n       \
  \                       significantly larger!  Default value: false. This option\
  \ can be set to 'null' to clear the\n                              default value.\
  \ Possible values: {true, false} \n\nMUTATIONAL_COLLAPSE_PATH_ED=Integer\n     \
  \                         The maximium distance mutational path collapse searches\
  \ for the next nearest neighbors in\n                              the network.\
  \  Default value: 1. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default\n   \
  \                           value. \n\nMUTATIONAL_COLLAPSE=Boolean   Instead of\
  \ using the default fixed edit distance, use a mutational collapse strategy.  For\n\
  \                              the single largest barcode in the context, find all\
  \ neighbors within edit distance (ED) . \n                              For example,\
  \ set MUTATIONAL_COLLAPSE_PATH_ED=1.find neighbors to those neighbors at ED=1\n\
  \                              that are ALSO ED=2 to the original barcode.  Search\
  \ out to a maximum edit distance of\n                              EDIT_DISTANCE.\
  \  Default value: false. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the\n       \
  \                       default value. Possible values: {true, false} \n\nMUTATIONAL_COLLAPSE_METRICS_FILE=File\n\
  \                              If provided, writes out some metrics about each barcode\
  \ that is merged by mutational edit\n                              distance collapse.\
  \  Default value: null. \n\nLOW_MEMORY_MODE=Boolean       Use less memory but more\
  \ time.  Useful if your context groups are huge - very large cells\n           \
  \                   with lots of sequence data, etc.  Default value: false. This\
  \ option can be set to 'null'\n                              to clear the default\
  \ value. Possible values: {true, false} \n\n"
