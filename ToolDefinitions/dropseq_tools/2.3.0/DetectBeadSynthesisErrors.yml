  \ [options]\n\nFor each cell, gather up all the UMIs.  An error in synthesis will\
  \ result in the last base of the synthesis being fixed\nin >90% of the UMIs for\
  \ that cell, across all genes.This fixed base is T.  For cell barcodes where this\
  \ occurs, output\nthe cell barcode in a file, as well as (optionally) pad the cell\
  \ barcodes with N for the error bases.  In cases where we\ndon't know how to fixthe\
  \ error - when there are too many missing bases in the synthesis, or the synthesis\
  \ error isn't\none of the repairable types, we remove the read from the output BAM.\n\

  \                        The output BAM, with the synthesis error barcodes removed\
  \  Default value: null. \n\nREPORT=File                   A report of which barcodes\
  \ where collapsed, what the intended sequences were, and what\n                \
  \              base positions were changed.  There are 2 modes of errors reported.\
  \ The first is an\n                              insertion/deletion changes at bases\
  \ 1-11 in the intended sequence, where a base in the\n                         \
  \     intended sequence is partially incorperated into the related sequence resulting\
  \ in a\n                              deletion in the intended sequence generating\
  \ a new sequence, and an 'insertion' at the\n                              last\
  \ base of the sequence, which is the first base of the UMI. The second is a\n  \
  \                            substitution event at base 12, where the last base\
  \ is partially incorporated.  Both\n                              changes are the\
  \ same mechanism, but the signature of the change [indel vs subsitution]\n     \
  \                         differs.Not all repaired barcodes will have an intended\
  \ sequence - if the base is\n                              incorporated at a very\
  \ low rate compared to the number of UMIs in the repaired cell\n               \
  \               barcode library size, the intended sequence may be too small to\
  \ find.  Default value:\n                              null. \n\nPRIMER_SEQUENCE=String\
  \        The sequence of the primer.  Default value: null. \n\nEDIT_DISTANCE=Integer\
  \         When looking at fixed UMIs, see if the edit distance from the UMI to the\
  \ primer is within\n                              this threshold.  0 indicates a\
  \ perfect match between the primer and the UMI.  Default\n                     \
  \         value: 0. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.\
  \ \n\nCELL_BARCODE_TAG=String       The cell barcode tag.  Default value: XC. This\
  \ option can be set to 'null' to clear the\n                              default\

  \         value: 10. This option can be set to 'null' to clear the default value.\
  \ \n\nMIN_UMIS_PER_CELL=Integer     The minimum number of UMIs required to report\
  \ a cell barcode.  If this parameter is\n                              specified\
  \ and [NUM_BARCODES or CELL_BC_FILE] are not specified, then all cell barcodes\n\
  \                              with at least this many UMIs will be analyzed., optional=false\
  \  Default value: 20. This\n                              option can be set to 'null'\
  \ to clear the default value. \n\nNUM_BARCODES=Integer          Find the top set\
  \ of  most common barcodes by HQ reads and only use this set for analysis. \n  \
  \                            Default value: null. \n\nCELL_BC_FILE=File        \
  \     Override NUM_BARCODES, and process reads that have the cell barcodes in this\
  \ file instead.\n                              The file has 1 column with no header.\
  \  Default value: null. \n\nUMI_BIAS_BASE=Integer         Which base to scan for\
  \ UMI bias when repairing intended sequences with substitution\n               \
  \               errors.  This is typically the last base of the UMI.  If set to\
  \ null, program will use the\n                              last base of the UMI.\
  \  This argument only needs to be set if you've done something unusual\n       \
  \                       with your data.  Default value: null. \n\nNUM_THREADS=Integer\
  \           Number of threads to use for edit distance collapse.  Defaults to 1.\
  \  Default value: 1.\n                              This option can be set to 'null'\

  \  Default value: gf. This option can be set to\n                              'null'\
  \ to clear the default value. \n\nSTRAND_STRATEGY=StrandStrategyThe strand strategy\
  \ decides which reads will be used by analysis.  The SENSE strategy\n          \
  \                    requires the read and annotation to have the same strand. \
  \ The ANTISENSE strategy requires\n                              the read and annotation\
  \ to be on opposite strands.  The BOTH strategy is permissive, and\n           \
  \                   allows the read to be on either strand.  Default value: SENSE.\
  \ This option can be set to\n                              'null' to clear the default\
  \ value. Possible values: {SENSE, ANTISENSE, BOTH} \n\nLOCUS_FUNCTION_LIST=LocusFunction\n\

  \ for analysis.  Default value: [CODING, UTR]. This option can be set to 'null'\n\
  \                              to clear the default value. Possible values: {INTERGENIC,\
  \ INTRONIC, UTR, CODING,\n                              RIBOSOMAL} This option may\
  \ be specified 0 or more times. This option can be set to 'null'\n             \
