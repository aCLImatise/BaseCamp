          \n   para [options] command [command-specific arguments]\n\nThe commands\
          \ are:\n\npara create jobList\n   This makes the job-tracking database from\
          \ a text file with the\n   command line for each job on a separate line.\n\
          \   options:\n      -cpu=N  Number of CPUs used by the jobs, default 1.\n\
          \      -ram=N  Number of bytes of RAM used by the jobs.\n         Default\
          \ is RAM on node divided by number of cpus on node.\n         Shorthand\
          \ expressions allow t,g,m,k for tera, giga, mega, kilo.\n         e.g. 4g\

          \ an absolute path or a path\n       relative to the current directory.\
          \  The resulting path is use as the\n       batch name.  The directory is\
