  \ [name | default=consensus]\n\n\tExample: seq2profile.pl ACNNGGTGT 1 motif1 > output.motif\n\
  \n\tConsensus sequence must be composed of IUPAC characters:  ACGT RYMKWS BDHV N\n\
  \tNote: # of mismatches is a tricky conversion for degenerate characters [RYMKWS/BDHV]\n\
  \t\tand should be checked in the results - mimatches are based on ACGT values\n\n"
