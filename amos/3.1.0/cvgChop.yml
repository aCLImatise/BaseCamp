  \ \n        [-byscf] [-split]\n\n-sum - summarize the coverages\n-map - build map\
  \ of coverage areas\n-cvg <min_cvg> - create multi-fasta file of regions\n     \
  \            in genome with > <min_cvg> coverage. (Default: 2) \n-byscf - the contigs\
  \ are reported in the order and orientation implied by\n    the scaffolds.  Option\
  \ requires -a.\n-split - splits the contigs into chunks that have > 0 coverage over\
  \ all length\n                 \nIf no option or just -cvg is passed to the program\
  \ the output file will be\nnamed <asm_file>.<min_cvg>x  or <contig_file>.<min_cvg>x\
  \ depending on the\ntype of input.\n\nIf -sum or -map is passed, the output will\
  \ be reported to STDOUT.\n"
