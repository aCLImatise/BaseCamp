help_text: " Feature-Response Curve pipeline\n\n Usage:          \n      FRCurve [params]\
  \ \\\n\t\t-D GENOME_SIZE=<n>\t- Genome size (number of bps)\n\t\t-D BANK=<n>\t\t\
  - AMOS bank name\n\t\t\n Description:\n\tThe Feature-Response curve characterizes\
  \ the sensitivity (coverage) of the sequence \n\tassembler as a function of its\
  \ discrimination threshold (number of features).\n\tGiven any set of features computed\
  \ by the amosvalidate pipeline, the response (quality) \n\tof the assembler output\
  \ is analyzed as a function of the maximum number of possible \n \terrors (features)\
  \ allowed in the contigs. \n\tFor more details see the wiki page at: \n\thttp://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/amos/index.php?title=FRCurve\n\
  \n Output:\n\tThe Feature-Response curve (FRC) is saved in file \"FRC.txt\", while\
  \ \n\tFRCs for each feature type are saved respectively in: \n\t\"FRC_coverage.txt\"\
  , \"FRC_polymorphism.txt\", \"FRC_breakpoint.txt\", \n\t\"FRC_kmer.txt\", \"FRC_matepair.txt\"\
  \ and \"FRC_misassembly.txt\"\n\n Output file format:\n\tEach file contains the\
  \ FRCs in 3-columns format\n\t- column 1 = feature threshold T;\n\t- column 2 =\
  \ contigs' N50 associated to the threshold T in column 1;\n \t- column 3 = cumulative\
  \ size of the contigs whose number of features is <= T;\n\n"
