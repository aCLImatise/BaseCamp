help_text: "\e[1mNAME\e[0m\n    \e[1minterleafq\e[0m - interleave and deinterleave\
  \ FASTQ paired reads.\n\n\e[1mSYNOPSIS\e[0m\n    To interleave\n\n      interleafq\
  \ reads_R1.fq reads_R2.fq > reads_interleaved.fq\n\n    To deinterleave:\n\n   \
  \   interleafq -o prefix reads_interleaved.fq\n\n\e[1mDESCRIPTION\e[0m\n    \e[1minterleafq\e\
  [0m can read FASTQ file, gzipped or not, and interleave or\n    deinterleave them.\
  \ When receiving two files, it will \e[4minterleave\e[0m them, if\n    receiving\
  \ a single file it will \e[4mdeinterleave\e[0m it. It is designed to perform\n \
  \   some internal checks to minimize the occurrences of malformed output, if\n \
  \   compared with popular Bash alternatives (like\n    <https://gist.github.com/nathanhaigh/3521724>).\n\
  \n\e[1mPARAMETERS\e[0m\n    \e[1m-o\e[0m, \e[1m--output-prefix\e[0m STRING\n   \
  \     Basename for the output file when deinterleaving. Will produce by\n      \
  \  default \"{prefix}_R1.fastq\" and \"{prefix}_R2.fastq\".\n\n    \e[1m-1\e[0m,\
  \ \e[1m--first-pair\e[0m FILE\n        Filename for the first pair produced when\
  \ deinterleaving. Alternative\n        to \"-o\", if the specified output filename\
  \ ends with '.gz' will print a\n        compressed file.\n\n    \e[1m-2\e[0m, \e\
  [1m--second-pair\e[0m FILE\n        Filename for the second pair produced when deinterleaving.\
  \ Alternative\n        to \"-o\", if the specified output filename ends with '.gz'\
  \ will print a\n        compressed file.\n\n    \e[1m-s\e[0m, \e[1m--strip-comments\e\
  [0m\n        Will remove comments from the sequence headers (\e[4mi. e.\e[0m any\
  \ string after\n        the first space character in the read name line).\n\n  \
  \  \e[1m-r\e[0m, \e[1m--relaxed\e[0m\n        Will \e[1mnot\e[0m check for inconsistencies\
  \ in read names and sequence/quality\n        length. The read names should be equal\
  \ until the first '/'.\n\n    \e[1m-i\e[0m, \e[1m--force-interleave\e[0m\n     \
  \   When supplying only the first pair-end file it will set interleave\n       \
  \ mode, looking for a second pair-end file (replacing _R1 with _R2)\n\n    \e[1m--version\e\
  [0m\n        Display version number and exit.\n\n    \e[1m-v\e[0m, \e[1m--verbose\e\
  [0m\n        Display additional information (total printed sequences at the end,\n\
  \        useful for truncated files).\n\n    \e[1m-h\e[0m, \e[1m--help\e[0m\n  \
  \      Display this help message.\n\n\e[1mBUGS\e[0m\n    Please open an issue in\
