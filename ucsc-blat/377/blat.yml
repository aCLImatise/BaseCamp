help_text: "blat - Standalone BLAT v. 36x2 fast sequence search command line tool\n\
  usage:\n   blat database query [-ooc=11.ooc] output.psl\nwhere:\n   database and\
  \ query are each either a .fa, .nib or .2bit file,\n      or a list of these files\
  \ with one file name per line.\n   -ooc=11.ooc tells the program to load over-occurring\
  \ 11-mers from\n      an external file.  This will increase the speed\n      by\
  \ a factor of 40 in many cases, but is not required.\n   output.psl is the name\
  \ of the output file.\n   Subranges of .nib and .2bit files may be specified using\
  \ the syntax:\n      /path/file.nib:seqid:start-end\n   or\n      /path/file.2bit:seqid:start-end\n\
  \   or\n      /path/file.nib:start-end\n   With the second form, a sequence id of\
  \ file:start-end will be used.\noptions:\n   -t=type        Database type.  Type\
  \ is one of:\n                    dna - DNA sequence\n                    prot -\
  \ protein sequence\n                    dnax - DNA sequence translated in six frames\
  \ to protein\n                  The default is dna.\n   -q=type        Query type.\
  \  Type is one of:\n                    dna - DNA sequence\n                   \
  \ rna - RNA sequence\n                    prot - protein sequence\n            \
  \        dnax - DNA sequence translated in six frames to protein\n             \
  \       rnax - DNA sequence translated in three frames to protein\n            \
  \      The default is dna.\n   -prot          Synonymous with -t=prot -q=prot.\n\
  \   -ooc=N.ooc     Use overused tile file N.ooc.  N should correspond to \n    \
  \              the tileSize.\n   -tileSize=N    Sets the size of match that triggers\
  \ an alignment.  \n                  Usually between 8 and 12.\n               \
  \   Default is 11 for DNA and 5 for protein.\n   -stepSize=N    Spacing between\
  \ tiles. Default is tileSize.\n   -oneOff=N      If set to 1, this allows one mismatch\
  \ in tile and still\n                  triggers an alignment.  Default is 0.\n \
  \  -minMatch=N    Sets the number of tile matches.  Usually set from 2 to 4.\n \
  \                 Default is 2 for nucleotide, 1 for protein.\n   -minScore=N  \
  \  Sets minimum score.  This is the matches minus the \n                  mismatches\
  \ minus some sort of gap penalty.  Default is 30.\n   -minIdentity=N Sets minimum\
  \ sequence identity (in percent).  Default is\n                  90 for nucleotide\
  \ searches, 25 for protein or translated\n                  protein searches.\n\
  \   -maxGap=N      Sets the size of maximum gap between tiles in a clump.  Usually\n\
  \                  set from 0 to 3.  Default is 2. Only relevent for minMatch >\
  \ 1.\n   -noHead        Suppresses .psl header (so it's just a tab-separated file).\n\
  \   -makeOoc=N.ooc Make overused tile file. Target needs to be complete genome.\n\
  \   -repMatch=N    Sets the number of repetitions of a tile allowed before\n   \
  \               it is marked as overused.  Typically this is 256 for tileSize\n\
  \                  12, 1024 for tile size 11, 4096 for tile size 10.\n         \
  \         Default is 1024.  Typically comes into play only with makeOoc.\n     \
  \             Also affected by stepSize: when stepSize is halved, repMatch is\n\
  \                  doubled to compensate.\n   -mask=type     Mask out repeats. \
  \ Alignments won't be started in masked region\n                  but may extend\
  \ through it in nucleotide searches.  Masked areas\n                  are ignored\
  \ entirely in protein or translated searches. Types are:\n                    lower\
  \ - mask out lower-cased sequence\n                    upper - mask out upper-cased\
  \ sequence\n                    out   - mask according to database.out RepeatMasker\
  \ .out file\n                    file.out - mask database according to RepeatMasker\
  \ file.out\n   -qMask=type    Mask out repeats in query sequence.  Similar to -mask\
  \ above, but\n                  for query rather than target sequence.\n   -repeats=type\
  \  Type is same as mask types above.  Repeat bases will not be\n               \
  \   masked in any way, but matches in repeat areas will be reported\n          \
  \        separately from matches in other areas in the psl output.\n   -minRepDivergence=NN\
  \   Minimum percent divergence of repeats to allow \n                  them to be\
  \ unmasked.  Default is 15.  Only relevant for \n                  masking using\
  \ RepeatMasker .out files.\n   -dots=N        Output dot every N sequences to show\
  \ program's progress.\n   -trimT         Trim leading poly-T.\n   -noTrimA     \
  \  Don't trim trailing poly-A.\n   -trimHardA     Remove poly-A tail from qSize\
  \ as well as alignments in \n                  psl output.\n   -fastMap       Run\
  \ for fast DNA/DNA remapping - not allowing introns, \n                  requiring\
  \ high %ID. Query sizes must not exceed 5000.\n   -out=type      Controls output\
  \ file format.  Type is one of:\n                    psl - Default.  Tab-separated\
  \ format, no sequence\n                    pslx - Tab-separated format with sequence\n\

  \ - multiz-associated maf format\n                    sim4 - similar to sim4 format\n\
