  \           [NB_C]: (integer [1;20]) order size of the regular context   \n    \
  \               model. Higher values use more RAM but, usually, are  \n        \
  \           related to a better compression score.               \n           [NB_D]:\
  \ (integer [1;5000]) denominator to build alpha, which \n                   is a\
  \ parameter estimator. Alpha is given by 1/[NB_D].\n                   Higher values\
  \ are usually used with higher [NB_C],   \n                   and related to confiant\
  \ bets. When [NB_D] is one,    \n                   the probabilities assume a Laplacian\
  \ distribution.   \n           [NB_I]: (integer {0,1,2}) number to define if a sub-program\
  \  \n                   which addresses the specific properties of DNA       \n\
  \                   sequences (Inverted repeats) is used or not. The     \n    \
  \               number 2 turns ON this sub-program without the       \n        \
  \           regular context model (only inverted repeats). The   \n            \
  \       number 1 turns ON the sub-program using at the same  \n                \
  \   time the regular context model. The number 0 does    \n                   not\
  \ contemple its use (Inverted repeats OFF). The    \n                   use of this\
  \ sub-program increases the necessary time \n                   to compress but\
  \ it does not affect the RAM.          \n           [NB_H]: (integer [1;254]) size\
  \ of the cache-hash for deeper  \n                   context models, namely for\
  \ [NB_C] > 14. When the     \n                   [NB_C] <= 14 use, for example,\
  \ 1 as a default. The   \n                   RAM is highly dependent of this value\
  \ (higher value  \n                   stand for higher RAM).                   \
  \            \n           [NB_G]: (real [0;1)) real number to define gamma. This\
  \ value \n                   represents the decayment forgetting factor of the \
  \   \n                   regular context model in definition.                 \n\
  \           [NB_S]: (integer [0;20]) maximum number of editions allowed  \n    \
  \               to use a substitutional tolerant model with the same \n        \
  \           memory model of the regular context model with       \n            \
  \       order size equal to [NB_C]. The value 0 stands for   \n                \
  \   turning the tolerant context model off. When the     \n                   model\
  \ is on, it pauses when the number of editions   \n                   is higher\
  \ that [NB_C], while it is turned on when    \n                   a complete match\
  \ of size [NB_C] is seen again. This  \n                   is probabilistic-algorithmic\
  \ model very usefull to   \n                   handle the high substitutional nature\
  \ of genomic     \n                   sequences. When [NB_S] > 0, the compressor\
  \ used more \n                   processing time, but uses the same RAM and, usually,\
  \ \n                   achieves a substantial higher compression ratio. The \n \
  \                  impact of this model is usually only noticed for     \n     \
  \              [NB_C] >= 14.                                        \n         \
  \  [NB_E]: (integer [1;5000]) denominator to build alpha for    \n             \
  \      substitutional tolerant context model. It is         \n                 \
  \  analogous to [NB_D], however to be only used in the  \n                   probabilistic\
  \ model for computing the statistics of  \n                   the substitutional\
  \ tolerant context model.           \n           [NB_A]: (real [0;1)) real number\
  \ to define gamma. This value \n                   represents the decayment forgetting\
  \ factor of the    \n                   substitutional tolerant context model in\
  \ definition. \n                   Its definition and use is analogus to [NB_G].\
