- id: keep_info
  doc: Maintain site and allele-level annotations when decomposing. Note that in many
    cases, such as multisample VCFs, these won't be valid post-decomposition.  For
    biallelic loci in single-sample VCFs, they should be usable with caution.

  doc: Maintain genotype-level annotations when decomposing.  Similar caution should
    be used for this as for --keep-info.
