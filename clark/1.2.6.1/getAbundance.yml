  \ <result2>.csv ... <result_n>.csv -a <minAbundance> ... \n\nDefinition of parameters:\
  \ \n\n-c <minConfidenceScore>           \t To filter assignments based on their\
  \ confidence score (if available) using the\n                                  \t\
  \ threshold value minConfidenceScore (a value between 0.5 and 1.0). \n         \
  \                         \t The abundance estimation for each target will count\
  \ only\n                                  \t assignments with a confidence score\
  \ higher than minConfidenceScore.\n                                  \t Assignments\
  \ that have a confidence score lower than minConfidenceScore\n                 \
  \                 \t will be marked as unclassified and so counted in the \n   \
  \                               \t category UNKNOWN in the abundance estimation\
  \ report.\n                                  \t The default value is 0.5.\n\n-g\
  \ <minGamma>                     \t To filter assignments based on their gamma score\
  \ (if available) using the\n                                  \t threshold value\
  \ minGamma (a value between 0 and 1.0). \n                                  \t The\
  \ abundance estimation for each target will count only\n                       \
  \           \t assignments with a gamma score higher than minGamma.\n          \
  \                        \t Assignments that have a gamma score lower than minGamma\n\
  \                                  \t will be marked as unclassified and so counted\
  \ in the \n                                  \t category UNKNOWN in the abundance\
  \ estimation report.\n                                  \t The default value is\
  \ 0.\n\n-D <Directory_Path>               \t The directory path of the database\
  \ (the same you indicated when calling set_targets.sh).\n                      \
  \            \t This parameter is required to load scientific names of all targets\
  \ ONLY if you pass\n                                  \t results of a metagenomic\
  \ sample.\n\n-F <result1>.csv <result2>.csv ... <result_n>.csv\n               \
  \                   \t results file or list of results file produced by CLARK.\n\
  \                                  \t Important Note: You can pass a results file\
  \ produced by any mode of execution of CLARK\n                                 \
  \ \t (full, express, spectrum, default), but if you pass several files, make sure\
  \ they all have\n                                  \t been produced by the same\
  \ mode. For example, if you pass result1.csv and result2.csv\n                 \
  \                 \t then result1.csv and result2.csv should be produced through\
  \ the same mode (e.g., full mode).\n\n-a <minAbundance(%)>              \t To output\
  \ only estimations that are higher than a certain threshold, minAbundance.\n   \
  \                               \t minAbundance is a percentage value (between 0\
  \ and 100).\n\n--highconfidence                  \t To count only high confidence\
  \ assignments for the abundance estimation. \n                                 \
  \ \t This option is equivalent to '-c 0.75 -g 0.03', in this version.\n\n--krona\t\
  \t\t\t  \t To export results in a 3-column file (i.e., taxon_id,taxon_id,magnitude)\
  \ for \n                                  \t the Krona tool (Hierarchical data browser,\
  \ Ondov et al, BMC Bioinformatics, 2011,\n                                  \t doi:\
  \ 10.1186/1471-2105-12-385. https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki).\n            \

  \ abundance from CLARK's assignments (with the filtering options if any).\n    \
  \                              \t Then, to create the Krona diagram, run ktImportTaxonomy\
  \ with the option '-m 3', for example:\n                                  \t $ ktImportTaxonomy-o\
  \ results.html -m 3 results.krn\n--mpa                             \t To export\
  \ results in the MetaPhlan's mpa format. A two-column file, where the first column,\n\
  \                                  \t is the taxonomy rank and the second column\
  \ is the total number of reads mapped to that rank or below.\n\n"
