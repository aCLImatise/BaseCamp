  \ CLARK only):\tinteger, >=0.\n-o <minFreqtObject>, \t minimum of k-mer frequency\

  \ of the targets definition:\t text.\n-D <directoryDB/>,   \t directory name for\
  \ the database (to load/save database files):\t text.\n-O <fileObjects>,    \t filename\

  \ of execution: 0 (full), 1 (default), 2 (express) and 3 (spectrum).\n         \

  \ objects files contains very long/large sequences (e.g.,\n                    \
  \ \t long contigs from genome assembly, long sequencing reads from Nanopore or Pacbio,\
  \ etc.)\n                     \t and allocate more memory accordingly. This option\

  \ creation of the database (target specific k-mers files). This option is no more\
  \ supported.\n--ldm,               \t to request the loading of the database by\
  \ memory mapped-file (in multithreaded mode, multiple parallel threads are requested).\n\
  --kso,               \t to request a preliminary k-spectrum analysis of each object\
  \ (for mode 3 only).\n--extended,          \t to request an extended output of the\
  \ full mode (for CLARK only).\n-g <iteration>,      \t gap or number of non-overlapping\
  \ k-mers to pass for the database creation (for CLARK-l only). The default value\

  \ CLARK/CLARK-S only). \n\n--help,              \t to print help/options.\n--version,\
