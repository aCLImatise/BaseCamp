help_text: "missing secondary file name and length\n\nApplication to convert AXT file\
  \ to LAV file. Reads an AXT file from standard\ninput and writes a LAV file to standard\
  \ out; some statistics are written to\nstandard error.\n\nusage: %prog primary_spec\
  \ secondary_spec [--silent] < axt_file > lav_file\n\nEach spec is of the form seq_file[:species_name]:lengths_file.\n\
  \n- seq_file should be a format string for the file names for the individual\n \
  \ sequences, with %s to be replaced by the alignment's src field.  For\n  example,\
  \ \"hg18/%s.nib\" would prescribe files named \"hg18/chr1.nib\",\n  \"hg18/chr2.nib\"\
  , etc.\n\n- species_name is optional.  If present, it is prepended to the alignment's\n\
  \  src field.\n\n- Lengths files provide the length of each chromosome (lav format\
  \ needs this\n  information but axt file does not contain it).  The format is a\
  \ series of\n  lines of the form:\n\n  <chromosome name> <length>\n\n  The chromosome\
  \ field in each axt block must match some <chromosome name> in\n  the lengths file.\n\
