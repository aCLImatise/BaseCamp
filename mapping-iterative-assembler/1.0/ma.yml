  \   -R <REGION_START:REGION_END>\n   -I <ID to assign to assembly sequence>\nma\
  \ reports information from a maln assembly file as generated by mia\nHow the assembly\
  \ calls each base can be determined by the\nconsensus code. 1 = highest, positive\
  \ aggregate score base (if any)\n                2 = highest aggregate score base\
  \ if it is 2400 higher\n                    than second highest\nThe output format\
  \ can be specified through -f as one of the following.\nMore complete descriptions\
  \ of these output formats is below,\nunder FORMATS\n1 => clustalw\n2 => line format;\
  \ one line each for consensus, reference\n     and coverage\n3 => column format;\
  \ one line per base, one column for consensus,\n     reference, and coverage; includes\
  \ header with summary info\n4 => columns description of all assembly data for positions\
  \ that differ\n     between consensus and CURRENT reference sequence (see FORMATS,\
  \ below)\n41 => same as above, but for ALL positions\n5 => fasta format output of\
  \ assembled sequence only\n6 => show all fragments in a region specified by -R\n\
  \ -C Color format 6 output -> don't pipe this output to file!\n7 => ACE\n\n\nFORMATS\
  \ (option f):\n1 => clustalw\n2 => line format; first line is \"Consensus, chrM,\
  \ coverage:\"\n      second line is the entire, assembled, aligned consensus sequence\n\
  \      third line is the entire aligned reference sequence to which the\n      consensus\
  \ is aligned\n      fourth line is the sequence coverage at each position in a space-\n\
  \      separated list of integers\n3 => column format; header shows summary statistics;\
  \ table has one row\n      per position; columns are described in the output\n4\
  \ => alternative column format with one row per base that differes between\n   \
  \   the consensus assembly and the reference of this iteration. \n      Note that\
  \ in the FINAL iteration reference and consensus are equal! \n      So there won't\
  \ be any output. Each row has the following\n      columns: (1)position on reference;\
  \ 0-based coordinates, (2) reference\n      base, (3)consensus assembly base, (4)coverage,\
  \ (5)A's, (6)C's, (7)G's,\n      (8)T's, (9)gaps; columns 5 through 9 should add\
  \ up to column 4\n      (10) aggregate score for A, (11) aggregate score for C\n\
  \      (12) aggregate score for G, (13) aggregate score for T\n41=> same as above,\
  \ but for every position\n5 => fasta format using ID \"Consensus\" for the assembly\n\
  6 => region; shows the reference sequence, the consensus sequence, and then\n  \
  \    all assembled fragments in a region specified by option -R\n61=> same as above,\
  \ but in multi-fasta format for viewing in Bioedit, e.g.\n     (also requires a\
  \ region as specified by the option -R\n7 => ACE format\n"
