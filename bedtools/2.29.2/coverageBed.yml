  description: 'Report a histogram of coverage for each feature in A as well as a
    summary histogram for _all_ features in A. Output (tab delimited) after each feature
    in A: 1) depth 2) # bases at depth 3) size of A 4) % of A at depth'
  synonyms:
  - -hist
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Report the depth at each position in each A feature. Positions reported
    are one based.  Each position and depth follow the complete A feature.
  synonyms:
  - -d
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: report the count of overlaps, don't compute fraction, etc.
  synonyms:
  - -counts
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Only
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Report the mean depth of all positions in each A feature.
  synonyms:
  - -mean
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to
    strand.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that
    overlap A on the _opposite_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without
    respect to strand.
  synonyms:
  - -S
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)

  - -F
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B. - In other
    words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90% of A and
    A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.
  synonyms:
  - -r
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B. - In other
    words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires that either 90% of
    A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered. Without -e, both fractions would have to
    be satisfied.

  description: Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.

  description: Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order across
    input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.
  synonyms:
  - -g
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming
    conventions for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Print
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line of
    output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved in a buffer. This will
    make printing large output files  noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction
    with other software tools and scripts that need to process one line of bedtools
    output at a time.
