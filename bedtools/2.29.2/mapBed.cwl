    columns can be specified in a comma-delimited list.'

- id: specify_operation_applied
  doc: 'Specify the operation that should be applied to -c. Valid operations: sum,
    min, max, absmin, absmax, mean, median, mode, antimode stdev, sstdev collapse
    (i.e., print a delimited list (duplicates allowed)),  distinct (i.e., print a
    delimited list (NO duplicates allowed)),  distinct_sort_num (as distinct, sorted
    numerically, ascending), distinct_sort_num_desc (as distinct, sorted numerically,
    desscending), distinct_only (delimited list of only unique values), count count_distinct
    (i.e., a count of the unique values in the column),  first (i.e., just the first
    value in the column),  last (i.e., just the last value in the column),  Default:
    sum Multiple operations can be specified in a comma-delimited list. If there is
    only column, but multiple operations, all operations will be applied on that column.
    Likewise, if there is only one operation, but multiple columns, that operation
    will be applied to all columns. Otherwise, the number of columns must match the
    the number of operations, and will be applied in respective order. E.g., "-c 5,4,6
    -o sum,mean,count" will give the sum of column 5, the mean of column 4, and the
    count of column 6. The order of output columns will match the ordering given in
    the command.'

  inputBinding:
    prefix: -prec
- id: require_same_strandedness
  doc: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap A on
    the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to strand.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -s
- id: require_different_strandedness
  doc: Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _opposite_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect
    to strand.
  type: boolean

    prefix: -S

  doc: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e., 1bp).

  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -f
- id: minimum_overlap_b

    - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -F
- id: require_fraction_overlap
  doc: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B. - In other words,
    if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90% of A and A _also_
    overlaps 90% of B.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -r
- id: require_minimum_fraction
  doc: Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B. - In other words,
    if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires that either 90% of A is covered
    OR 10% of  B is covered. Without -e, both fractions would have to be satisfied.

  doc: Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order across input
    files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -g
- id: no_name_check
  doc: For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming conventions
    for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -nonamecheck
- id: bed
  doc: If using BAM input, write output as BED.

- id: header
  doc: the header from the A file prior to results.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -header
- id: no_buf
  doc: Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line of output to
    be printed as it is generated, rather than saved in a buffer. This will make printing
    large output files  noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with other
    software tools and scripts that need to process one line of bedtools output at
    a time.
