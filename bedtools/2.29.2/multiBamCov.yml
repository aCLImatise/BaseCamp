- !Flag
  description: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to

  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of each A. - Default is 1E-9

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for each A and B. -
    In other words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90%
    of A and A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.

  description: Minimum mapping quality allowed. Default is 0.
