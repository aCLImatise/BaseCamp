inputs:
- id: a_bam
  doc: The A input file is in BAM format.  Output will be BAM as well. Replaces -a.
    - Requires BAM to be grouped or sorted by query.

  doc: Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM. is to write output
    in BAM when using -abam.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -ubam
- id: bed_pe
  doc: When using BAM input (-abam), write output as BEDPE. The default is to write
    output in BAM when using -abam.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -bedpe
- id: ed
  doc: Use BAM total edit distance (NM tag) for BEDPE score. - Default for BEDPE is
    to use the minimum of of the two mapping qualities for the pair. - When -ed is
    used the total edit distance from the two mates is reported as the score.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -ed
- id: minimum_overlap_required
  doc: Minimum overlap required as fraction of A (e.g. 0.05). Default is 1E-9 (effectively
    1bp).

- id: require_same_strandedness
  doc: Require same strandedness when finding overlaps. Default is to ignore stand.
    Not applicable with -type inspan or -type outspan.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:

- id: require_different_strandedness
  doc: Require different strandedness when finding overlaps. Default is to ignore
    stand. Not applicable with -type inspan or -type outspan.
