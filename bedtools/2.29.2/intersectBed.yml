  description: Write the original entry in A for each overlap.
  synonyms:
  - -wa
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original entry in B for each overlap. - Useful for knowing
    _what_ A overlaps. Restricted by -f and -r.
  synonyms:
  - -wb
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Perform a "left outer join". That is, for each feature in A report
    each overlap with B.  If no overlaps are found,  report a NULL feature for B.
  synonyms:
  - -loj
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base pairs of
    overlap between the two features. - Overlaps restricted by -f and -r. Only A features
    with overlap are reported.
  synonyms:
  - -wo
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base pairs of
    overlap between the two features. - Overlapping features restricted by -f and
    -r. However, A features w/o overlap are also reported with a NULL B feature and
    overlap = 0.
  synonyms:
  - -wao
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original A entry _once_ if _any_ overlaps found in B. - In
    other words, just report the fact >=1 hit was found. - Overlaps restricted by
    -f and -r.
  synonyms:
  - -u
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For each entry in A, report the number of overlaps with B. - Reports
    0 for A entries that have no overlap with B. - Overlaps restricted by -f, -F,
    -r, and -s.
  synonyms:
  - -c
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For each entry in A, separately report the number of - overlaps with
    each B file on a distinct line. - Reports 0 for A entries that have no overlap
    with B. - Overlaps restricted by -f, -F, -r, and -s.
  synonyms:
  - -C
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Only report those entries in A that have _no overlaps_ with B. - Similar
    to "grep -v" (an homage).
  synonyms:
  - -v
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write uncompressed BAM output. Default writes compressed BAM.
  synonyms:
  - -ubam
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to
    strand.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that
    overlap A on the _opposite_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without
    respect to strand.
  synonyms:
  - -S
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
  synonyms:
  - -f
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
  synonyms:
  - -F
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B. - In other
    words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90% of A and
    A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.
  synonyms:
  - -r
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B. - In other
    words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires that either 90% of
    A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered. Without -e, both fractions would have to
    be satisfied.
  synonyms:
  - -e
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.
  synonyms:
  - -split
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order across
    input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.
  synonyms:
  - -g
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming
    conventions for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".
  synonyms:
  - -nonamecheck
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: the "chromsweep" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.
  synonyms:
  - -sorted
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Use
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: When using multiple databases, provide an alias for each that will
    appear instead of a fileId when also printing the DB record.
  synonyms:
  - -names
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: When using multiple databases, show each complete filename instead
    of a fileId when also printing the DB record.

  - -filenames
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: When using multiple databases, sort the output DB hits for each record.
  synonyms:
  - -sortout
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If using BAM input, write output as BED.
  synonyms:
  - -bed
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: the header from the A file prior to results.
  synonyms:
  - -header
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Print
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line of
    output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved in a buffer. This will
    make printing large output files  noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction
    with other software tools and scripts that need to process one line of bedtools
    output at a time.
  synonyms:
  - -nobuf
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer. Takes an integer
    argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported. Note: currently has no effect with
    compressed files.'
