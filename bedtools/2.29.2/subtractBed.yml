!Command
positional: []
named:
- !Flag
  description: Remove entire feature if any overlap.  That is, by default, only subtract
    the portion of A that overlaps B. Here, if any overlap is found (or -f amount),
    the entire feature is removed.
  synonyms:
  - -A
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Same as -A except when used with -f, the amount is the sum of all features
    (not any single feature).
  synonyms:
  - -N
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original entry in B for each overlap. - Useful for knowing
    _what_ A overlaps. Restricted by -f and -r.
  synonyms:
  - -wb
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Write the original A and B entries plus the number of base pairs of
    overlap between the two features. - Overlaps restricted by -f and -r. Only A features
    with overlap are reported.
  synonyms:
  - -wo
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require same strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that overlap
    A on the _same_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without respect to
    strand.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require different strandedness.  That is, only report hits in B that
    overlap A on the _opposite_ strand. - By default, overlaps are reported without
    respect to strand.
  synonyms:
  - -S
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of A. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
  synonyms:
  - -f
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Minimum overlap required as a fraction of B. - Default is 1E-9 (i.e.,
    1bp). - FLOAT (e.g. 0.50)
  synonyms:
  - -F
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the fraction overlap be reciprocal for A AND B. - In other
    words, if -f is 0.90 and -r is used, this requires that B overlap 90% of A and
    A _also_ overlaps 90% of B.
  synonyms:
  - -r
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Require that the minimum fraction be satisfied for A OR B. - In other
    words, if -e is used with -f 0.90 and -F 0.10 this requires that either 90% of
    A is covered OR 10% of  B is covered. Without -e, both fractions would have to
    be satisfied.
  synonyms:
  - -e
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Treat "split" BAM or BED12 entries as distinct BED intervals.
  synonyms:
  - -split
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Provide a genome file to enforce consistent chromosome sort order across
    input files. Only applies when used with -sorted option.
  synonyms:
  - -g
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: For sorted data, don't throw an error if the file has different naming
    conventions for the same chromosome. ex. "chr1" vs "chr01".
  synonyms:
  - -nonamecheck
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: the "chromsweep" algorithm for sorted (-k1,1 -k2,2n) input.
  synonyms:
  - -sorted
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Use
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If using BAM input, write output as BED.
  synonyms:
  - -bed
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: the header from the A file prior to results.
  synonyms:
  - -header
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: Print
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Disable buffered output. Using this option will cause each line of
    output to be printed as it is generated, rather than saved in a buffer. This will
    make printing large output files  noticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction
    with other software tools and scripts that need to process one line of bedtools
    output at a time.
  synonyms:
  - -nobuf
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'Specify amount of memory to use for input buffer. Takes an integer
    argument. Optional suffixes K/M/G supported. Note: currently has no effect with
    compressed files.'
  synonyms:
  - -iobuf
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
