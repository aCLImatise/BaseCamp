      \ than saved\n\t\tin a buffer. This will make printing large output files \n\
      \t\tnoticeably slower, but can be useful in conjunction with\n\t\tother software\
      \ tools and scripts that need to process one\n\t\tline of bedtools output at\

      \tcreates new intervals from the regions just up- and down-stream\n\tof your\

      \ -A -e \\\n\t\"select chrom, size from hg19.chromInfo\"  > hg19.genome\n\n"

  \ bamtobed (aka bamToBed)\nVersion: v2.29.2\nSummary: Converts BAM alignments to\
  \ BED6 or BEDPE format.\n\nUsage:   bedtools bamtobed [OPTIONS] -i <bam> \n\nOptions:\
  \ \n\t-bedpe\tWrite BEDPE format.\n\t\t- Requires BAM to be grouped or sorted by\
  \ query.\n\n\t-mate1\tWhen writing BEDPE (-bedpe) format, \n\t\talways report mate\
  \ one as the first BEDPE \"block\".\n\n\t-bed12\tWrite \"blocked\" BED format (aka\
  \ \"BED12\"). Forces -split.\n\n\t\thttp://genome-test.cse.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1\n\
  \n\t-split\tReport \"split\" BAM alignments as separate BED entries.\n\t\tSplits\
  \ only on N CIGAR operations.\n\n\t-splitD\tSplit alignments based on N and D CIGAR\
  \ operators.\n\t\tForces -split.\n\n\t-ed\tUse BAM edit distance (NM tag) for BED\
  \ score.\n\t\t- Default for BED is to use mapping quality.\n\t\t- Default for BEDPE\
  \ is to use the minimum of\n\t\t  the two mapping qualities for the pair.\n\t\t\
  - When -ed is used with -bedpe, the total edit\n\t\t  distance from the two mates\
  \ is reported.\n\n\t-tag\tUse other NUMERIC BAM alignment tag for BED score.\n\t\
  \t- Default for BED is to use mapping quality.\n\t\t  Disallowed with BEDPE output.\n\
  \n\t-color\tAn R,G,B string for the color used with BED12 format.\n\t\tDefault is\
  \ (255,0,0).\n\n\t-cigar\tAdd the CIGAR string to the BED entry as a 7th column.\n\
