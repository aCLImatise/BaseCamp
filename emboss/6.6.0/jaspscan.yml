  description: "string     [all] The name 'all' reads in all matrix files from the\
    \ selected JASPAR matrix set. You can specify individual matrices by giving their\
    \ names with commas between then, such as: 'ma0001.1,ma0015*'. The case of the\
    \ names is not important. You can specify a file of matrix names to read in by\
    \ giving the name of the file holding the matrix names with a '@' character in\
    \ front of it, for example, '@matrix.list'. Blank lines and lines starting with\
    \ a hash character or '!' are ignored and all other lines are concatenated together\
    \ with a comma character ',' and then treated as the list of enzymes to search\
    \ for. An example of a file of matrix names is: ! my matrices ma0001.1, ma0002.1\
    \ ! other matrices ma0010.1 ma0032* ma0053.1 (Any string)"
