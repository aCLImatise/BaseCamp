  description: toggle     [N] The region can be 'masked' by converting the sequence
    characters to lower-case, some non-EMBOSS programs e.g. fasta can interpret this
    as a masked region. The sequence is unchanged apart from the case change. You
    might like to ensure that the whole sequence is in upper-case before masking the
    specified regions to lower-case by using the '-supper' flag.
