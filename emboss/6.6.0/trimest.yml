help_text: "Remove poly-A tails from nucleotide sequences\nVersion: EMBOSS:6.6.0.0\n\
  \n   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:\n  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide\
  \ sequence(s) filename and optional\n                                  format, or\

  \ Sequence set(s)\n                                  filename and optional format\
  \ (output USA)\n\n   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:\n   -minlength          integer\
  \    [4] This is the minimum length that a poly-A\n                            \
  \      (or poly-T) tail must have before it is\n                               \
  \   removed. If there are mismatches in the tail\n                             \
  \     than there must be at least this length of\n                             \
  \     poly-A tail before the mismatch for the\n                                \
  \  mismatch to be considered part of the tail.\n                               \
  \   (Integer 1 or more)\n   -mismatches         integer    [1] If there are this\
  \ number or fewer\n                                  contiguous non-A bases in a\
  \ poly-A tail\n                                  then, if there are '-minlength'\
  \ 'A' bases\n                                  before them, they will be considered\
  \ part of\n                                  the tail and removed .\n          \
  \                        For example the terminal 4 A's of GCAGAAAA\n          \
  \                        would be removed with the default values of\n         \
  \                         -minlength=4 and -mismatches=1 (There are\n          \
  \                        not at least 4 A's before the last 'G' and\n          \
  \                        so only the A's after it are considered to\n          \
  \                        be part of the tail). The terminal 9 bases\n          \
  \                        of GCAAAAGAAAA would be removed; There are\n          \
  \                        at least -minlength A's preceeding the last\n         \
  \                         'G', so it is part of the tail. (Integer 0\n         \
  \                         or more)\n   -[no]reverse        boolean    [Y] When a\
  \ poly-T region at the 5' end of\n                                  the sequence\
  \ is found and removed, it is\n                                  likely that the\
  \ sequence is in the reverse\n                                  sense. This option\
  \ will change the sequence\n                                  to the forward sense\
  \ when it is written out.\n                                  If this option is not\
  \ set, then the sense\n                                  will not be changed.\n\
  \   -tolower            toggle     [N] The poly-A region can be 'masked' by\n  \
  \                                converting the sequence characters to\n       \
  \                           lower-case. Some non-EMBOSS programs e.g.\n        \
  \                          fasta can interpret this as a masked region.\n      \
  \                            The sequence is unchanged apart from the\n        \
  \                          case change. You might like to ensure that\n        \
  \                          the whole sequence is in upper-case before\n        \
  \                          masking the specified regions to lower-case\n       \
  \                           by using the '-supper' sequence qualifier.\n\n   Advanced\
  \ (Unprompted) qualifiers:\n   -[no]fiveprime      boolean    [Y] If this is set\
  \ true, then the 5' end of\n                                  the sequence is inspected\
  \ for poly-T tails.\n                                  These will be removed if\
  \ they are longer\n                                  than any 3' poly-A tails. If\
  \ this is false,\n                                  then the 5' end is ignored.\n\
  \n   General qualifiers:\n   -help               boolean    Report command line\
  \ options and exit. More\n                                  information on associated\
