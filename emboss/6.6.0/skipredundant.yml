  description: 'menu       [1] This option specifies whether to remove redundancy
    at a single threshold percentage sequence similarity or remove redundancy outside
    a range of acceptable threshold percentage similarity. All permutations of pair-wise
    sequence alignments are calculated for each set of input sequences in turn using
    the EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm.
    Redundant sequences are removed in one of two modes as follows: (i) If a pair
    of proteins achieve greater than a threshold percentage sequence similarity (specified
    by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of proteins have
    a percentage sequence similarity that lies outside an acceptable range (specified
    by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded. (Values: 1 (Single threshold
    percentage sequence similarity); 2 (Outside a range of acceptable threshold percentage
    similarities))'

  description: float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty is the score
    taken away when a gap is created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison
    matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein
    sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences. (Floating point number
    from 1.0 to 100.0)

  description: float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension, penalty is added
    to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long
    gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short
    gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception
    is where one or both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors
    in which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result
    by setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension
    penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating point number from 0.0 to 10.0)
