  doc: "pattern    The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the\namino acids are used.\n\
    The symbol 'x' is used for a position where\nany amino acid is accepted.\nAmbiguities\
    \ are indicated by listing the\nacceptable amino acids for a given position,\n\
    between square parentheses '[ ]'. For\nexample: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or\
    \ Thr.\nAmbiguities are also indicated by listing\nbetween a pair of curly brackets\
    \ '{ }' the\namino acids that are not accepted at a given\nposition. For example:\
    \ {AM} stands for any\namino acid except Ala and Met.\nEach element in a pattern\
    \ is separated from\nits neighbor by a '-'. (Optional in\nfuzzpro).\nRepetition\
    \ of an element of the pattern can\nbe indicated by following that element with\n\
    a numerical value or a numerical range\nbetween parenthesis. Examples: x(3)\n\
    corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4) corresponds to\nx-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.\nWhen a\
    \ pattern is restricted to either the\nN- or C-terminal of a sequence, that pattern\n\
    either starts with a '<' symbol or\nrespectively ends with a '>' symbol.\nA period\
    \ ends the pattern. (Optional in\nfuzzpro).\nFor example, [DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C"
