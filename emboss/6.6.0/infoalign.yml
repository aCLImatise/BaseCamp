help_text: "Display basic information about a multiple sequence alignment\nVersion:\
  \ EMBOSS:6.6.0.0\n\n   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:\n  [-sequence]         \
  \ seqset     The sequence alignment to be displayed.\n  [-outfile]           outfile\
  \    [*.infoalign] If you enter the name of a\n                                \
  \  file here then this program will write the\n                                \
  \  sequence details into that file.\n\n   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:\n  \
  \ -matrix             matrix     [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]\n   \
  \                               This is the scoring matrix file used when\n    \
  \                              comparing sequences. By default it is the\n     \
  \                             file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file\n    \
  \                              'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These\n     \
  \                             files are found in the 'data' directory of\n     \
  \                             the EMBOSS installation.\n   -refseq             string\
  \     [0] If you give the number in the alignment\n                            \
  \      or the name of a sequence, it will be taken\n                           \
  \       to be the reference sequence. The reference\n                          \
  \        sequence is the one against which all the\n                           \
  \       other sequences are compared. If this is set\n                         \
  \         to 0 then the consensus sequence will be\n                           \
  \       used as the reference sequence. By default\n                           \
  \       the consensus sequence is used as the\n                                \
  \  reference sequence. (Any string)\n   -html               boolean    [N] Format\
  \ output as an HTML table\n\n   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:\n   -plurality\
  \          float      [50.0] Set a cut-off for the % of positive\n             \
  \                     scoring matches below which there is no\n                \
  \                  consensus. The default plurality is taken as\n              \
  \                    50% of the total weight of all the\n                      \
  \            sequences in the alignment. (Number from\n                        \
  \          0.000 to 100.000)\n   -identity           float      [0.0] Provides the\
  \ facility of setting the\n                                  required number of\
  \ identities at a position\n                                  for it to give a consensus.\
