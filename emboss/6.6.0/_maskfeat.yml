    \ a type starting 'repeat' is masked. You can set this to be any feature type\
    \ you wish to mask. See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/embl/WebFeat/ for a list of the EMBL\
    \ feature types and see Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in http://www.expasy.org/sprot/userman.html\
    \ for a list of the Swissprot feature types. The type may be wildcarded by using\
    \ '*'. If you wish to mask more than one type, separate their names with spaces\

  description: toggle     [N] The region can be 'masked' by converting the sequence
    characters to lower-case, some non-EMBOSS programs e.g. fasta can interpret this
    as a masked region. The sequence is unchanged apart from the case change. You
    might like to ensure that the whole sequence is in upper-case before masking the
    specified regions to lower-case by using the '-supper' flag.
