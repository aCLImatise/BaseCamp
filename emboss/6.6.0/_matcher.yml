  \                                 This is the scoring matrix file used when\n  \
  \                                comparing sequences. By default it is the\n   \
  \                               file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file\n  \
  \                                'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These\n   \
  \                               files are found in the 'data' directory of\n   \
  \                               the EMBOSS installation.\n   -alternatives     \
  \  integer    [1] This sets the number of alternative\n                        \
  \          matches output. By default only the highest\n                       \
  \           scoring alignment is shown. A value of 2\n                         \
  \         gives you other reasonable alignments. In\n                          \
  \        some cases, for example multidomain proteins\n                        \
  \          of cDNA and genomic DNA comparisons, there\n                        \

  \        alignments. (Integer 1 or more)\n   -gapopen            integer    [14\
  \ for protein, 16 for nucleic] The gap\n                                  penalty\
  \ is the score taken away when a gap\n                                  is created.\
  \ The best value depends on the\n                                  choice of comparison\
  \ matrix. The default\n                                  value of 14 assumes you\
  \ are using the\n                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein\
  \ sequences, or a\n                                  value of 16 and the EDNAFULL\
  \ matrix for\n                                  nucleotide sequences. (Positive\
  \ integer)\n   -gapextend          integer    [4 for any sequence] The gap length,\
  \ or gap\n                                  extension, penalty is added to the standard\n\
  \                                  gap penalty for each base or residue in the\n\
  \                                  gap. This is how long gaps are penalized.\n \
  \                                 Usually you will expect a few long gaps\n    \
  \                              rather than many short gaps, so the gap\n       \
  \                           extension penalty should be lower than the\n       \
  \                           gap penalty. An exception is where one or\n        \
  \                          both sequences are single reads with\n              \
  \                    possible sequencing errors in which case you\n            \
  \                      would expect many single base gaps. You can\n           \
  \                       get this result by setting the gap penalty\n           \
  \                       to zero (or very low) and using the gap\n              \
  \                    extension penalty to control gap scoring.\n               \
