    \ If a\npair of proteins achieve greater than a\nthreshold percentage sequence\
    \ similarity\n(specified by the user) the shortest\nsequence is discarded. (ii)\
    \ If a pair of\nproteins have a percentage sequence\nsimilarity that lies outside\
    \ an acceptable\nrange (specified by the user) the shortest\nsequence is discarded.\

    \ long gaps are penalized. Usually you\nwill expect a few long gaps rather than\
    \ many\nshort gaps, so the gap extension penalty\nshould be lower than the gap\
    \ penalty. An\nexception is where one or both sequences are\nsingle reads with\
    \ possible sequencing\nerrors in which case you would expect many\nsingle base\
