  \ codons\n                                  used in frame 1. (Frame -2 is the set\
  \ of\n                                  codons used by frame 2, similarly frames\
  \ -3\n                                  and 3). This is a common standard, used\
  \ by\n                                  the Staden package and other programs. If\n\
  \                                  you prefer to define frame '-1' as using the\n\
  \                                  set of codons starting with the last codon\n\
  \                                  of the sequence, then set this to be true.\n\
  \   -[no]methionine     boolean    [Y] START codons at the beginning of protein\n\
  \                                  products will usually code for Methionine,\n\

  \                                  is internal to a protein. This qualifier\n  \
  \                                sets all such START codons to code for\n      \
