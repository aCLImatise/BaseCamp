  \ few lines to determine the appropriate widths\nfor each of the columns.  It will\
  \ then display the data with the appropriate\nspacing to keep columns together.\
  \  If a future cell is larger than the\npredetermined size, it is truncated.\n\n\
  This can then be fed into something like 'less' for paging\n\nUsage: tab_view.py\
  \ {opts} filename.tab\n\nOptions:\n-l lines    The number of lines to read in to\
  \ estimate the size of a column.\n            [default 100]\n-d delim    Use this\
