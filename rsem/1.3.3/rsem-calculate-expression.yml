  \ the\n        filename, the input is instead assumed to come from standard input.\n\
  \        RSEM requires all alignments of the same read group together. For\n   \
  \     paired-end reads, RSEM also requires the two mates of any alignment\n    \
  \    be adjacent. In addition, RSEM does not allow the SEQ and QUAL\n        fields\
  \ to be empty. See Description section for how to make input\n        file obey\

  \ do not contain quality scores. (Default: off)\n\n    --strandedness <none|forward|reverse>\n\
  \        This option defines the strandedness of the RNA-Seq reads. It\n       \
  \ recognizes three values: 'none', 'forward', and 'reverse'. 'none'\n        refers\
  \ to non-strand-specific protocols. 'forward' means all\n        (upstream) reads\
  \ are derived from the forward strand. 'reverse'\n        means all (upstream) reads\
  \ are derived from the reverse strand. If\n        'forward'/'reverse' is set, the\

  \ Please refer to the SAM official website for the\n        details of FAI format.\
  \ (Default: off)\n\n    --bowtie2\n        Use Bowtie 2 instead of Bowtie to align\
  \ reads. Since currently RSEM\n        does not handle indel, local and discordant\
  \ alignments, the Bowtie2\n        parameters are set in a way to avoid those alignments.\
  \ In\n        particular, we use options '--sensitive --dpad 0 --gbar 99999999\n\
  \        --mp 1,1 --np 1 --score-min L,0,-0.1' by default. The last parameter\n\

  \       Sort BAM file aligned under transcript coordidate by read name.\n      \
  \  Setting this option on will produce deterministic maximum likelihood\n      \

  \ generates a BAM file, instead of outputting all alignments\n        a read has\
  \ with their posterior probabilities, one alignment is\n        sampled according\
  \ to the posterior probabilities. The sampling\n        procedure includes the alignment\
  \ to the \"noise\" transcript, which\n        does not appear in the BAM file. Only\
  \ the sampled alignment has a\n        weight of 1. All other alignments have weight\
  \ 0. If the \"noise\"\n        transcript is sampled, all alignments appeared in\

  \ and index the bam file.\n        'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam' and\n       \
  \ 'sample_name.genome.sorted.bam.bai' will be generated. (Default:\n        off)\n\

  \ of 'samtools sort'. Note\n        that the default used here is different from\
  \ the default used by\n        samtools. (Default: 1G)\n\nALIGNER OPTIONS\n    --seed-length\
  \ <int>\n        Seed length used by the read aligner. Providing the correct value\
  \ is\n        important for RSEM. If RSEM runs Bowtie, it uses this value for\n\

  \        its mates' (for paired-end reads) length less than this value will\n  \
  \      be ignored. If the references are not added poly(A) tails, the\n        minimum\
  \ allowed value is 5, otherwise, the minimum allowed value is\n        25. Note\
  \ that this script will only check if the value >= 5 and give\n        a warning\

  \ are deprecated. They are here only for\n        compatibility reasons and may\
  \ be removed in future releases.\n\n    --sam\n        Inputs are alignments in\
  \ SAM format. (Default: off)\n\n    --bam\n        Inputs are alignments in BAM\
  \ format. (Default: off)\n\n    --strand-specific\n        Equivalent to '--strandedness\

  \ protocol.\n        (Default: off)\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    In its default mode, this\
  \ program aligns input reads against a reference\n    transcriptome with Bowtie\
  \ and calculates expression values using the\n    alignments. RSEM assumes the data\
  \ are single-end reads with quality\n    scores, unless the '--paired-end' or '--no-qualities'\
  \ options are\n    specified. Alternatively, users can use STAR to align reads using\
  \ the\n    '--star' option. RSEM has provided options in 'rsem-prepare-reference'\n\
  \    to prepare STAR's genome indices. Users may use an alternative aligner\n  \
  \  by specifying '--alignments', and providing an alignment file in\n    SAM/BAM/CRAM\
  \ format. However, users should make sure that they align\n    against the indices\
  \ generated by 'rsem-prepare-reference' and the\n    alignment file satisfies the\
  \ requirements mentioned in ARGUMENTS\n    section.\n\n    One simple way to make\
  \ the alignment file satisfying RSEM's requirements\n    is to use the 'convert-sam-for-rsem'\
  \ script. This script accepts\n    SAM/BAM/CRAM files as input and outputs a BAM\
  \ file. For example, type\n    the following command to convert a SAM file, 'input.sam',\
  \ to a\n    ready-for-use BAM file, 'input_for_rsem.bam':\n\n      convert-sam-for-rsem\
  \ input.sam input_for_rsem\n\n    For details, please refer to 'convert-sam-for-rsem's\
  \ documentation page.\n\nNOTES\n    1. Users must run 'rsem-prepare-reference' with\
  \ the appropriate\n    reference before using this program.\n\n    2. For single-end\
  \ data, it is strongly recommended that the user provide\n    the fragment length\
  \ distribution parameters (--fragment-length-mean and\n    --fragment-length-sd).\
  \ For paired-end data, RSEM will automatically\n    learn a fragment length distribution\
  \ from the data.\n\n    3. Some aligner parameters have default values different\
  \ from their\n    original settings.\n\n    4. With the '--calc-pme' option, posterior\
  \ mean estimates will be\n    calculated in addition to maximum likelihood estimates.\n\
  \n    5. With the '--calc-ci' option, 95% credibility intervals and posterior\n\
  \    mean estimates will be calculated in addition to maximum likelihood\n    estimates.\n\
  \n    6. The temporary directory and all intermediate files will be removed\n  \
  \  when RSEM finishes unless '--keep-intermediate-files' is specified.\n\n    With\
  \ the '--run-pRSEM' option and associated options (see section\n    'PRIOR-ENHANCED\
  \ RSEM OPTIONS' above for details), prior-enhanced RSEM\n    will be running. Prior\
  \ parameters will be learned from supplied external\n    data set(s) and assigned\
  \ as initial pseudo-counts for isoforms in the\n    corresponding partition for\
  \ Gibbs sampling.\n\nOUTPUT\n    sample_name.isoforms.results\n        File containing\

  \ if neither '--calc-pme' nor\n        '--calc-ci' is set.\n\n        'transcript_id'\
  \ is the transcript name of this transcript. 'gene_id'\n        is the gene name\
  \ of the gene which this transcript belongs to\n        (denote this gene as its\
  \ parent gene). If no gene information is\n        provided, 'gene_id' and 'transcript_id'\
  \ are the same.\n\n        'length' is this transcript's sequence length (poly(A)\
  \ tail is not\n        counted). 'effective_length' counts only the positions that\
  \ can\n        generate a valid fragment. If no poly(A) tail is added,\n       \
  \ 'effective_length' is equal to transcript length - mean fragment\n        length\
  \ + 1. If one transcript's effective length is less than 1,\n        this transcript's\
  \ both effective length and abundance estimates are\n        set to 0.\n\n     \
  \   'expected_count' is the sum of the posterior probability of each\n        read\
  \ comes from this transcript over all reads. Because 1) each read\n        aligning\
  \ to this transcript has a probability of being generated\n        from background\
  \ noise; 2) RSEM may filter some alignable low quality\n        reads, the sum of\
  \ expected counts for all transcript are generally\n        less than the total\
  \ number of reads aligned.\n\n        'TPM' stands for Transcripts Per Million.\
  \ It is a relative measure\n        of transcript abundance. The sum of all transcripts'\
  \ TPM is 1\n        million. 'FPKM' stands for Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript\
  \ per\n        Million mapped reads. It is another relative measure of transcript\n\
  \        abundance. If we define l_bar be the mean transcript length in a\n    \
  \    sample, which can be calculated as\n\n        l_bar = \\sum_i TPM_i / 10^6\
  \ * effective_length_i (i goes through\n        every transcript),\n\n        the\
  \ following equation is hold:\n\n        FPKM_i = 10^3 / l_bar * TPM_i.\n\n    \
  \    We can see that the sum of FPKM is not a constant across samples.\n\n     \
  \   'IsoPct' stands for isoform percentage. It is the percentage of this\n     \
  \   transcript's abandunce over its parent gene's abandunce. If its\n        parent\
  \ gene has only one isoform or the gene information is not\n        provided, this\
  \ field will be set to 100.\n\n        'posterior_mean_count', 'pme_TPM', 'pme_FPKM'\
  \ are posterior mean\n        estimates calculated by RSEM's Gibbs sampler.\n  \
  \      'posterior_standard_deviation_of_count' is the posterior standard\n     \
  \   deviation of counts. 'IsoPct_from_pme_TPM' is the isoform percentage\n     \
  \   calculated from 'pme_TPM' values.\n\n        'TPM_ci_lower_bound', 'TPM_ci_upper_bound',\
  \ 'FPKM_ci_lower_bound'\n        and 'FPKM_ci_upper_bound' are lower(l) and upper(u)\
  \ bounds of 95%\n        credibility intervals for TPM and FPKM values. The bounds\
  \ are\n        inclusive (i.e. [l, u]).\n\n        'TPM_coefficient_of_quartile_variation'\
  \ and\n        'FPKM_coefficient_of_quartile_variation' are coefficients of\n  \
  \      quartile variation (CQV) for TPM and FPKM values. CQV is a robust\n     \
  \   way of measuring the ratio between the standard deviation and the\n        mean.\
  \ It is defined as\n\n        CQV := (Q3 - Q1) / (Q3 + Q1),\n\n        where Q1\
  \ and Q3 are the first and third quartiles.\n\n    sample_name.genes.results\n \

  \ is a BAM-formatted file of read alignments\n        in genomic coordinates. Alignments\
  \ of reads that have identical\n        genomic coordinates (i.e., alignments to\
  \ different isoforms that\n        share the same genomic region) are collapsed\
  \ into one alignment. The\n        MAPQ field of each alignment is set to min(100,\
  \ floor(-10 *\n        log10(1.0 - w) + 0.5)), where w is the posterior probability\
  \ of that\n        alignment being the true mapping of a read. In addition, RSEM\
  \ pads a\n        new tag ZW:f:value, where value is a single precision floating\n\
  \        number representing the posterior probability. If an alignment is\n   \
  \     spliced, a XS:A:value tag is also added, where value is either '+'\n     \
  \   or '-' indicating the strand of the transcript it aligns to.\n\n    sample_name.genome.sorted.bam\

  \n    sample_name.log\n        Only generated when --alignments is not specified.\n\
  \n        It captures alignment statistics outputted from the user-specified\n \
  \       aligner.\n\n    sample_name.stat\n        This is a folder instead of a\

  \        'sample_name.stat/sample_name.model' stores RNA-Seq model parameters\n\
  \        learned from the data. The format and meanings of each filed of this\n\
  \        file are described in 'model_file_description.txt' under RSEM\n       \

  \        prior-enhanced RSEM\n\n        - 'sample_name.stat/sample_name_prsem.all_tr_features'\n\
  \          It stores isofrom features for deriving and assigning pRSEM prior.\n\
  \          The first line is a header and the rest is one isoform per line.\n  \
  \        The description for each column is:\n\n          * trid: transcript ID\
  \ from input annotation\n\n          * geneid: gene ID from input anntation\n\n\
  \          * chrom: isoform's chromosome name\n\n          * strand: isoform's strand\
  \ name\n\n          * start: isoform's end with the lowest genomic loci\n\n    \
  \      * end: isoform's end with the highest genomic loci\n\n          * tss_mpp:\
  \ average mappability of [TSS-500bp, TSS+500bp], where\n            TSS is isoform's\
  \ transcription start site, i.e. 5'-end\n\n          * body_mpp: average mappability\

  \ will be generated.\n\n        - 'sample_name.stat/sample_name.pval_LL'\n     \
  \     It stores a p-value and a log-likelihood. The p-value indicates\n        \
  \  whether the combination of multiple complementary data sets is\n          informative\
  \ for RNA-seq quantification. The log-likelihood shows\n          how well pRSEM's\

  \ set isoforms.\n\n        - 'sample_name.stat/sample_name.lgt_mdl.RData'\n    \

  \ files are under '/ref' with name\n    'mouse_125'.\n\n    1) '/data/mmliver.fq',\
  \ single-end reads with quality scores. Quality\n    scores are encoded as for 'GA\
  \ pipeline version >= 1.3'. We want to use 8\n    threads and generate a genome\
  \ BAM file. In addition, we want to append\n    gene/transcript names to the result\

  \ and '/data/mmliver_2.fq', stranded paired-end\n    reads with quality scores.\
  \ Suppose the library is prepared using TruSeq\n    Stranded Kit, which means the\
  \ first mate should map to the reverse\n    strand. Quality scores are in SANGER\

  \ are the same as 1). This time we assume the bowtie executables\n    are under\
  \ '/sw/bowtie'. We want to take a fragment length distribution\n    into consideration.\
  \ We set the fragment length mean to 150 and the\n    standard deviation to 35.\
  \ In addition to a BAM file, we also want to\n    generate credibility intervals.\
  \ We allow RSEM to use 1GB of memory for\n    CI calculation:\n\n     rsem-calculate-expression\

  \ paired-end reads\n    with quality scores and read files are compressed by gzip.\
  \ We want to\n    use STAR to aligned reads and assume STAR executable is '/sw/STAR'.\n\
  \    Suppose we want to use 8 threads and do not generate a genome BAM file:\n\n\
