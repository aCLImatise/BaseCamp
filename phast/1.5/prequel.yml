  description: (for use with --msa-format MAF) Read the complete text of the reference
    sequence from <fname> (FASTA format) and combine it with the contents of the MAF
    file to produce a complete, ordered representation of the alignment.  The reference
    sequence of the MAF file is assumed to be the one that appears first in each block.

  description: (experimental) Estimate posterior probabilities by Gibbs sampling rather
    than by the sum-product algorithm.  Sample each sequence <nsamples> times and
    estimate posterior probabilities as fraction of times each base appeared at each
    position.  This option is used by default if a dinucleotide or trinucleotide model
    is given (exact inference not possible).   NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
