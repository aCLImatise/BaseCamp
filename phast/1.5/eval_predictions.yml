  \                      -l <seq_len_list> [OPTIONS] \n\nDESCRIPTION:\nCompares predicted\
  \ genes with \"real\" (or annotated) genes.\nReports standard measures of prediction\
  \ quality.  The following\nmeasures are reported:\n\n    - nucleotide sensitivity\
  \ (Sn)\n    - nucleotide specificity (Sp)\n    - approximate correlation (AC)\n\
  \    - correlation coefficient (CC)\n    - exon sensitivity (ESn)\n    - exon specificity\
  \ (ESp)\n    - proportion of real exons correctly predicted (CRa)\n    - proportion\
  \ of real exons partially predicted (PCa)\n    - proportion of real exons with overlapping\
  \ predictions (OLa)\n    - missed exons (ME)\n    - proportion of predicted exons\
  \ that are correct (CRp)\n    - proportion of predicted exons that are partially\
  \ correct (PCp)\n    - proportion of predicted exons that overlap real ones (OLp)\n\
  \    - wrong exons (WE)\n\nAll quantities are computed as described in \"Evaluation\
  \ of Gene-Finding\nPrograms on Mammalian Sequences,\" by Rogic et al. (Genome Research\n\
  11:817-832).  Note that CRa + PCa + OLa + ME = 1 and CRp + PCp + OLp +\nWE = 1.\
  \  Note also that each set (predicted and real) should consist of\nnon-overlapping\
  \ groups of features (see 'refeature').\n\nOPTIONS:\n    -r <real_fname_list> \n\

  \ the single name \"CDS\".\n\n    -d <fname_prefix>  \n        Dump full coords\

  \ sets, or in neither set.\n\n"
