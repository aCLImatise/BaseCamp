help_text: "\nPROGRAM: phyloP\n\nUSAGE: phyloP [OPTIONS] tree.mod [alignment] > out\n\
  \n    The phylogenetic model must be in the .mod format produced by the\n    phyloFit\
  \ program.  The alignment file can be in any of several file\n    formats (see --msa-format).\
  \  No alignment is required with the --null\n    option. \n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n  \
  \  Compute conservation or acceleration p-values based on an alignment and\n   \
  \ a model of neutral evolution.  Will also compute p-values of\n    conservation/acceleration\
  \ in a subtree and in its complementary\n    supertree given the whole tree (see\
  \ --subtree).  P-values can be\n    produced for entire input alignments (the default),\
  \ pre-specified\n    intervals within an alignment (see --features), or individual\
  \ sites\n    (see --wig-scores and --base-by-base).\n\n    The default behavior\
  \ is to compute a null distribution for the total\n    number of substitutions from\
  \ the tree model, an estimate of the number\n    of substitutions that have actually\
  \ occurred, and the p-value of this\n    estimate wrt the null distribution.  These\
  \ computations are performed\n    as described by Siepel, Pollard, and Haussler\
  \ (2006).  In addition to\n    the SPH method, phyloP can compute p-values or\n\
  \    conservation/acceleration scores using a likelihood ratio test\n    (--method\
  \ LRT), a score-based test (--method SCORE), or a procedure\n    similar to that\
  \ used by GERP (Cooper et al., 2005) (--method GERP).\n    These alternative methods\
  \ are currently supported only with\n    --base-by-base, --wig-scores, or --features.\n\
  \n    The main advantage of the SPH method is that it can provide a complete\n \
  \   and exact description of distributions over numbers of substitutions.\n    However,\
  \ simulation experiments suggest that the LRT and SCORE methods\n    have somewhat\
  \ better power than SPH for identifying selection,\n    especially when the expected\
  \ number of substitutions is small (e.g.,\n    with short branch lengths and/or\
  \ short intervals/individual sites).\n    These two methods are also faster.  They\
  \ are generally similar to one\n    another in power, but in many cases SCORE is\
  \ considerably faster than\n    LRT.  On the other hand, SCORE appears to have slightly\
  \ less power than\n    LRT at low false positive rates, i.e., for cases of extreme\
  \ selection.\n    Thus, when using --base-by-base, --wig-scores, or --features,\
  \ LRT is\n    recommended for most purposes, but SCORE is a good alternative if\
  \ speed\n    is an issue.\n\n    When computing p-values with the SPH method, the\
  \ default is to use the\n    posterior expected number of substitutions as an estimate\
  \ of the actual\n    number.  This is a conservative estimate, because it is biased\
  \ toward\n    the mean of the null distribution by the prior.  These p-values can\
  \ be\n    made less conservative with --fit-model and more conservative with\n \
  \   --confidence-interval (see below).\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n    1. Using the SPH method,\
  \ compute and report p-values of conservation\n    and acceleration for a given\
  \ alignment with respect to a neutral model\n    of evolution.  Estimated numbers\
  \ of substitutions are also reported.\n\n        phyloP neutral.mod alignment.fa\
  \ > report.txt\n\n    The file neutral.mod could be produced by running phyloFit\
  \ on data from\n    ancestral repeats or fourfold degenerate sites with an appropriate\
  \ tree\n    topology and substitution model.\n\n    2. Compute and report p-values\
  \ of conservation and acceleration for a\n    particular subtree of interest (using\
  \ SPH).\n\n        phyloP --subtree human-mouse_lemur neutral.mod alignment.fa >\
  \ report.txt\n\n    Here human-mouse_lemur denote the most recent common ancestor\
  \ of human\n    and mouse_lemur, which is the node that defines the primate clade\
  \ in\n    this phylogeny.  The tree_doctor program with the --name-ancestors\n \
  \   option can be used to assign names to ancestral nodes of the tree.\n\n    3.\
  \ Describe the complete null distribution over the number of\n    substitutions\
  \ for a 10bp alignment given the specified neutral model\n    (using SPH).\n\n \
  \       phyloP --null 10 neutral.mod > null.txt\n\n    A two-column table is produced\
  \ with numbers of substitutions and their\n    probabilities, up to an appropriate\
  \ upper limit.\n\n    4. Describe the complete posterior distribution over the number\
  \ of\n    substitutions in a given alignment (using SPH).\n\n        phyloP --posterior\
  \ neutral.mod alignment.fa > posterior.txt\n\n    5. Compute conservation scores\
  \ (-log10 p-values) for each site in an\n    alignment and output them in the fixed-step\
  \ wig format (see\n    http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html).  Use\
  \ the\n    likelihood ratio test (LRT) method.\n\n        phyloP --wig-scores --method\
  \ LRT neutral.mod alignment.fa > scores.wig\n\n    The --mode option can be used\
  \ instead to produce acceleration scores\n    (ACC), scores of nonneutrality (NNEUT),\
  \ or scores that summarize\n    conservation and acceleration (CONACC).  The --base-by-base\
  \ option can\n    be used to output additional statistics of interest (estimated\
  \ scale\n    factors, log10 likelihood ratios, etc.).  As discussed above, several\n\
  \    arguments to --method are possible.\n    \n    6. Similarly, compute scores\
  \ describing lineage-specific conservation\n    in primates.\n\n        phyloP --wig-scores\
  \ --method LRT --subtree human-mouse_lemur \\\n            neutral.mod alignment.fa\
  \ > scores.wig\n\n    7. Compute conservation p-values and associated statistics\
  \ for each\n    element in a BED file.  This time use a score test and allow for\n\
  \    acceleration as well as conservation, flagging elements under\n    acceleration\
  \ by making their p-values negative (CONACC mode).\n\n        phyloP --features\
  \ elements.bed --method SCORE --mode CONACC \\\n            neutral.mod alignment.fa\
  \ > element-scores.txt\n\n    This option can also be used with --subtree.  The\
  \ --gff-scores option\n    can be used to output the original features in GFF format\
  \ with scores\n    equal to -log10 p.  Note that the input file can be in GFF instead\
  \ of BED\n    format.\n\nOPTIONS:\n\n    --msa-format, -i FASTA|PHYLIP|MPM|MAF|SS\n\
  \        Alignment format (default is to guess format from file contents).\n\n \
  \   --method, -m SPH|LRT|SCORE|GERP\n        Method used to compute p-values or\
  \ conservation/acceleration scores\n        (Default SPH).  The likelihood ratio\
  \ test (LRT) and score test\n        (SCORE) compare an alternative model having\
  \ a free scale parameter\n        with the given neutral model, or, if --subtree\
  \ is used, an\n        alternative model having free scale parameters for the supertree\n\
  \        and subtree with a null model having a single free scale parameter.\n \
  \       P-values are computed by comparing test statistics with asymptotic\n   \

  \ -b\n        Like --wig-scores, but outputs multiple values per site, in a\n  \
  \      method-dependent way.  With 'SPH', output includes mean and\n        variance\
  \ of posterior distribution, with LRT and SCORE it\n        includes the estimated\
  \ scale factor(s) and test statistics, and\n        with GERP it includes the estimated\
  \ numbers of neutral,\n        observed, and rejected substitutions, along with\
  \ the number of\n        species available at each site.\n\n    --refidx, -r <refseq_idx>\n\
  \        (for use with --wig-scores or --base-by-base) Use coordinate frame\n  \
  \      of specified sequence in output.  Default value is 1, first\n        sequence\
  \ in alignment; 0 indicates coordinate frame of entire\n        multiple alignment.\n\
  \n    --mode, -o CON|ACC|NNEUT|CONACC\n        (For use with --wig-scores, --base-by-base,\
  \ or --features) Whether\n        to compute one-sided p-values so that small p\
  \ (large -log10 p)\n        indicates unexpected conservation (CON; the default)\
  \ or\n        acceleration (ACC); or two-sided p-values such that small p\n    \
  \    indicates an unexpected departure from neutrality (NNEUT).  The\n        fourth\
  \ option (CONACC) uses positive values (p-values or scores) to\n        indicate\
  \ conservation and negative values to indicate acceleration.\n        In GERP mode,\
  \ CON and CONACC both report the number of rejected\n        substitutions R (which\
  \ may be negative), while ACC reports -R, and\n        NNEUT reports abs(R).\n\n\
  \    --features, -f <file>\n        Read features from <file> (GFF or BED format)\
  \ and output a\n        table of p-values and related statistics with one row per\n\
  \        feature.  The features are assumed to use the coordinate frame\n      \
  \  of the first sequence in the alignment.  Not for use with\n        --null or\
  \ --posterior.  See also --gff-scores.\n\n    --gff-scores, -g\n        (For use\
  \ with features)  Instead of a table, output a GFF and\n        assign each feature\
  \ a score equal to its -log10 p-value.\n\n    --subtree, -s <node-name>\n      \

  \       the branch leading to them, and another partition consisting of the\n  \
  \      rest of the tree; \"--subtree human\" will create one partition\n       \
  \ consisting only of human and the branch leading to it and another\n        partition\
  \ consisting of the rest of the tree.  In 'SPH' mode, a\n        reversible substitution\
  \ model is assumed.\n\n    --branch, -B <node-name(s)>\n        (Not available in\

  \        substitutions by using a (central) confidence interval about the\n    \
  \    mean of the specified size (0 < val < 1).  To be conservative, the\n      \
  \  maximum of this interval is used when computing a p-value of\n        conservation,\
  \ and the minimum is used when computing a p-value of\n        acceleration.  The\
  \ variance of the posterior is computed\n        exactly, but the confidence interval\
  \ is based on the assumption\n        that the combined distribution will be approximately\
  \ normal (true\n        for large numbers of sites by central limit theorem).\n\n\
