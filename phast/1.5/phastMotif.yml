    (default FASTA).

  description: Read background model from specified file (.mod format). By default,
    the background model is estimated in a preprocessing step, by pooling all data.

- !Flag
  description: MEME mode.  Use multinomial rather than phylogenetic models.  Causes
    multiple alignments to be ignored -- any gaps are discarded and all sequences
    are assumed independent.

  - -m
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <+lst> Use the discriminative training method of Segal et al. (RECOMB'02),
    rather than EM.  The specified list should contain the filenames from msa_list
    that are to be considered *positive* examples (containing the desired motif);
    all others will be considered negative examples.  Can be used with or without
    -m.

  - -d
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Use "profile" models rather than phylogenetic models (characters in
    each alignment column assumed independent).  The resulting model is a hybrid of
    the full model and MEME's model.  Essentially, it uses the multiple alignments
    but not the phylogeny.  NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true

  description: Perform <n> random restarts and report the motif with highest likelihood.  Default
    number is 10.  Ignored with -I, -P, and -R unless -S is specified (see below).

- !Flag
  description: Run the algorithm after a "soft" initialization with each of the consensus
    sequences in the specified list. At each position, <pc> pseudocounts (see -c)
    are given to the consensus base and 1 pseudocount to all other bases.  Each string
    must have length at most equal to the size of the motif.  If shorter, it is used
    as a "seed" for a motif, with flanking positions treated as wildcards.

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <x,y>  Initialize with the x most prevalent y-tuples.  A soft initialization
    is performed, as above.  If y is less than the motif size, y-tuples are used as
    a "seed" for a motif, as above.
  synonyms:
  - -P
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: <x,y>  Initialize with a random sample of x y-tuples.  A soft initialization
    is performed, as above.  If y is less than the motif size, y-tuples are used as
    a "seed" for a motif, as above.

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: (for use with -I, -P, -R) Instead of doing a deterministic initialization
    based on a consensus sequence, sample parameters from a Dirichlet distribution
    defined by the pseudocounts (see -c).  In this case, random restarts are performed,
    as specified by -n.

    file.

  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Produce a BED file with predicted motifs, for use in the  UCSC browser.  Currently,
    sequence names must be formatted such as "chr10:102553847-102554897+", with the
