  \          bed_path out_path umap_dir kmer\n\nThis script expects an input gzipped\
  \ BED file, a directory with umap/bismap\nproduced files names as <chr>.uint8.unique.gz.\
  \ It will add one column to the\nbed file which would determine the fraction of\
  \ uniquely mappable reads that\npassover this region. The first column added to\
  \ input is single-read\nmappability, which is the percent of the region that is\
  \ uniquely mappable. The\nsecond added column is the multi-read mappability; the\
  \ probability that a\nrandonly selected read overlapping with that region is uniquely\
  \ mappable. If\nthe input BED file has 1 bp intervals, you can specify -SingleNucleotide\
  \ and\n-wigdir to use a faster algorithm.\n\npositional arguments:\n  bed_path \
