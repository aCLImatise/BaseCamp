help_text: "Usage:  kocos.pl [OPTIONS] BIGRAM \nDisplays the kth order Co-occurrences\
  \ of a given target word.\nTarget word should be specified via --literal or --regex\
  \ option.\n\nBIGRAM\n\tA list of bigrams formatted like the output (extended or\
  \ normal) \n\tof NSP programs count.pl or statistic.pl.\n\nOPTIONS:\n--literal LITERAL\
  \ \n\tSpecify the target word directly on command line as a literal.\n\n--regex\
  \ REGEXFILE\n\tSpecify a file containing Perl regular expression/s that define \n\
  \tthe target word.\n\n--order K \n\tSpecify the value of K (K>0) to find the kth\
  \ order co-occurrences. \n\tA Kth order co-occurrence is a word that co-occurs with\
  \ a (K-1)th \n\torder co-occurrence of the target word. \n \n\tBy default, the value\
  \ of K is set to 1 which simply lists the \n\twords that co-occur with a given target\
  \ word. When K is 2, all words \n\tthat co-occur with the words that co-occur with\
  \ the target word are \n\tshown, and so on for higher orders.\n \n--trace TRACEFILE\n\
  \tSpecify the name of a TRACEFILE to see a detailed trace report \n\tshowing  the\
  \ chains of co-occurrences. A chain shows how a Kth \n\torder co-occurrence is reached\
  \ as a sequence of K lower order \n\tco-occurrences. \n\t\te.g. WORD->First->Second->Third..->Kth\
  \ \n\tshows that 'First' is a first order co-occurrence of WORD,  \t\n\t'Second'\
  \ is a second order co-occurrence of WORD which co-occurs \n\twith 'First'. 'Third'\
  \ is a third order co-occurrence of WORD which  \n\tco-occurs with 'Second' and\
  \ so on until K is reached. \n--help\n        To display this message.\n\n--version\n\
  \        To display the version information.\n"
