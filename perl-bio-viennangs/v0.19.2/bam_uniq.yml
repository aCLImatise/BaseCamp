  description: Process bands of (supposedly paired-end) reads sharing the same name/id
    from a name-sorted BAM file. The reads of band are considered unique mappers if
    and only if all of them are unique mappers. In all other cases, all reads of a
    band are considered multi mappers. In a paired-end context this means that e.g.
    a read map uniquely, but its mate is a multi-mapper, both will be consideres multi-mappers.
