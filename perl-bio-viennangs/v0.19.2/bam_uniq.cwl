- id: band
  doc: Process bands of (supposedly paired-end) reads sharing the same name/id from
    a name-sorted BAM file. The reads of band are considered unique mappers if and
    only if all of them are unique mappers. In all other cases, all reads of a band
    are considered multi mappers. In a paired-end context this means that e.g. a read
    map uniquely, but its mate is a multi-mapper, both will be consideres multi-mappers.
