help_text: "Usage: solexa18to15.py [options]\n\nIt takes a FASTQ file generated by\
  \ Illumina Solexa pipeline version 1.8 (or\nnewer) and it converts the header of\
  \ the reads (i.e. read names have one\nspace) to the older Solexa Fastq format (where\
  \ the reads end with /1 or /2).\nAlso the reads marked as filtered can be optionally\
  \ be filtered out. Example:\nIt changes @GQWE8:57:C00T6ABXX:2:1101:1233:2230 1:N:0:CTTGTA\
