help_text: "\nFUSIONCATCHER-BATCH.PY version 0.12\n\nAuthor: Daniel Nicorici, Daniel.Nicorici@gmail.com\n\
  \nCopyright (c) 2009-2019 Daniel Nicorici\n\nIt is a wrapper for 'fusioncatcher.py'\
  \ which allows to run 'fusioncatcher.py' in\nbatch mode where the input is a directory\
  \ which contains the directories for\nwhich FusionCatcher should be run for each\
  \ of them separately.\n\nThe input file (given using -i or --input) may be:\n -\
  \ a text file with two columns (that are tab separated), where the first column\n\
  contains a list of paths (one line = one path = one sample) such that\na path is\
  \ a SRA file, or a directory containing one or more Fastq files, and the\nsecond\
  \ column (this is optional and may be missing) contains the corresponding\nsample\
  \ name which will be used to construct the output directory (also URLs may\nbe given\
  \ here)\n - a directory which contains subdirectories and each subdirectory contains\
  \ one\nor more Fastq files corresponding to one sample (one subdirectory = one sample);\n\
  all found subdirectories will be analyzed one by one by FusionCatcher.\n\n\n"
