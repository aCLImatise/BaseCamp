  description: The output FASTQ file containing the short reads where the nucleotides
    with low quality score 'B' have been converted to ambigous nucleotide N.
  synonyms:
  - -o

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default the only tails of B quality are removed. If this is used
    then the first occurence of B is used to trim the read.

  - -f
  - --find
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default the ambigous nucleotides are not convert to As. If this
    is set then all ambigous nucleotides will be converted to As.
  synonyms:
  - -a
  - --ambiguous
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: By default read qualities are in Illumina v1.5 format and the character
    'B' is used to search qualities. If this is used than the character '#' (that
    is B in Sanger format) is used to search the qualities.
  synonyms:
  - -s
  - --sanger
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The character to be use for replacing the nucleotide which have the
    quality score Q2. Default is 'N'.

    name: REPLACEMENT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If if this is larger than zero then all the short reads strictly shorter
    than this threshold (if the trimming of Bs would be done) are removed. Default
    is '0'.
