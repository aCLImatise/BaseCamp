help_text: "Usage: remove_reads_genome_transcriptome.py [options]\n\nGiven two MAP\
  \ files, generated by BOWTIE, as input it removes the reads from\nthe second one\
  \ which map worse than in the first file. This is intended to be\nused for removing\
  \ the short reads which map on transcriptome worse than on the\ngenome. Worse means\
  \ a larger number of mismatches. Both MAP files are assumed\nto contain only the\
  \ best mappings of a given read (one read is found to be\nmapping on the best stratum\
  \ which gives the minimum number of mismatches\ntherefore no read which has several\
  \ mappings with several different\nmismatches).\n\nOptions:\n  --version       \
