!Command
positional: []
named:
- !Flag
  description: The input file in text tab delimited format containing the fusion genes
    candidates produced by 'label_fusion_genes.py'.
  synonyms:
  - --input
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INPUT_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The input file in text tab delimited format containing the fusion genes
    and supporting reads produced by find_fusion_genes_map.py.
  synonyms:
  - --input_fusion_reads
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INPUT_FUSION_READS_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The threshold for the number of paired-end reads necessary for considering
    the fusion gene candidate for further analysis. All gene fusions candidate with
    a larger and equal number of supporting paired-end reads are written in the output
    file. Default value is 3.
  synonyms:
  - --threshold_pairs
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: THRESHOLD_PAIRS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The threshold for the number of paired-end reads necessary for considering
    the fusion gene candidate, which was labeled using '--allowed_labels', for further
    analysis. All gene fusions candidate with a larger and equal number of supporting
    paired-end reads are written in the output file. Default value is 0.
  synonyms:
  - --threshold_pairs_known
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: THRESHOLD_PAIRS_KNOWN
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: If --threshold_pairs selects more fusions than this threshold than
    this threshold will have priority (only the first top N will be selected). Default
    value is 5000.
  synonyms:
  - --threshold_count
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: THRESHOLD_COUNT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A fusion gene candidate which has been labeled in the input file with
    one of the following labels is skipped and not written in the output file. Default
    value is 'paralog'.
  synonyms:
  - --skip_labels
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: SKIP_LABELS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A fusion gene candidate which has been labeled in the input file with
    one of the following labels is considered for further analysis even if it has
    labels which disqualify it (from the --skipp_labels). Default value is 'known'.
  synonyms:
  - --allowed_labels
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: ALLOWED_LABELS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: A fusion gene candidate which has been labeled in the input file with
    one of the following labels is considered for further analysis even if it has
    labels which disqualify it (from the --skipp_labels) or is below the threshold.
    Default value is 'further_fusion'.
  synonyms:
  - --further_labels
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: FURTHER_LABELS
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The text tab separated file containing the fusion genes candidates
    which meet the conditions imposed by options '--threshold' and '--skip_labels'
    are written.
  synonyms:
  - --output
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The same file as the input file where and extra column is added for
    the genes which have been selected for further analysis.
  synonyms:
  - --output_fusion
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_FUSION_FILENAME
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The file containing the supporting reads which supports the gene considered
    for further analysis.
  synonyms:
  - --output_fusion_reads
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: OUTPUT_FUSION_READS_FILENAME
  optional: true
