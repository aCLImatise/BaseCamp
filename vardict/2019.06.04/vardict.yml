  - -B
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true

  description: If set, reads with mapping quality less than INT will be filtered and
    ignored

  - -Q
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'The phred score for a base to be considered a good call.  Default:
    22.5 (for Illumina) For PGM, set it to ~15, as PGM tends to under estimate base
    quality.'

  - -q
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'If set, reads with mismatches more than INT will be filtered and ignored.  Gaps
    are not counted as mismatches.   Valid only for bowtie2/TopHat or BWA aln followed
    by sampe.  BWA mem is calculated as NM - Indels.  Default: 8, or reads with more
    than 8 mismatches will not be used.'

  - --trim
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT

- !Flag
  description: Extension of bp to look for mismatches after insersion or deletion.  Default
    to 3 bp, or only calls when they are within 3 bp.
  synonyms:
  - -X
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Extension of bp of reference to build lookup table.  Default to 1200
    bp.  Increase the number will slowdown the program. The main purpose is to call
    large indels within 1000 bp that can be missed by discordant mate pairs.

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: number
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'For downsampling fraction.  e.g. 0.7 means roughly 70% downsampling.  Default:
    No downsampling.  Use with caution.  The downsampling will be random and non-reproducible.'

  - --downsample
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: double

- !Flag
  description: 'The Qratio of (good_quality_reads)/(bad_quality_reads+0.5).  The quality

    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: 'The minimum matches for a read to be considered.  If, after soft-clipping,
    the matched bp is less than INT, then the  read is discarded.  It is meant for
    PCR based targeted sequencing where there is no insert and the matching is only
    the primers. Default: 25, or reads with matches less than 25bp will be filtered'

  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: INT
  optional: true
- !Flag

  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: The genomic position that CRISPR/Cas9 suppose to cut, typically 3bp
    from the PAM NGG site and within the guide.  For CRISPR mode only.  It will adjust
    the variants (mostly In-Del) start and end sites to as close to this location

- !Flag
  description: 'In CRISPR mode, the minimum amount in bp that a read needs to overlap
    with cutting site.  If a read does not meet the criteria, it will not be used
