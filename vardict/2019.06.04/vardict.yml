  \ start] [-E end] [-s seg_starts] [-e seg_ends] [-x #_nu] [-g gene] [-f freq] [-r\
  \ #_reads] [-B #_reads] region_info\n\n    VarDict is a variant calling program\
  \ for SNV, MNV, indels (<120 bp default, but can be set using -I option), and complex\
  \ variants.  It accepts any BAM format, either\n    from DNA-seq or RNA-seq.  There\
  \ are several distinct features over other variant callers.  First, it can perform\
  \ local\n    realignment over indels on the fly for more accurate allele frequencies\
  \ of indels.  Second, it rescues softly clipped reads\n    to identify indels not\
  \ present in the alignments or support existing indels.  Third, when given the PCR\
  \ amplicon information,\n    it will perform amplicon-based variant calling and\
  \ filter out variants that show amplicon bias, a common false positive in PCR\n\
  \    based targeted deep sequencing.  Forth, it has very efficient memory management\
  \ and memory usage is linear to the region of\n    interest, not the depth.  Five,\
  \ it can handle ultra-deep sequencing and the performance is only linear to the\
  \ depth.  It has\n    been tested on depth over 2M reads.  Finally, it has a build-in\
  \ capability to perform paired sample analysis, intended for\n    somatic mutation\
  \ identification, comparing DNA-seq and RNA-seq, or resistant vs sensitive in cancer\
  \ research.  By default,\n    the region_info is an entry of refGene.txt from IGV,\
