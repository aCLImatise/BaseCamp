  description: flag alignments to this strand as not passing QC (0x200). Targetted
    BS-Seq libraries are often to a single strand, so we can flag them as QC failures.
    Note f == OT, r == OB. Likely, this will be 'f' as we will expect reads to align
    to the original-bottom (OB) strand and will flag as failed those aligning to the
    forward, or original top (OT).
