help_text: "\n** Sorry, option [--help] was not found. **\n\n\nAvailable options:\n\
  \n-get-sequence:\n    GetSequence() provides a basic interface to fetch\n    a sequence\
  \ from a SeqDB object given an OID.\n\n-iteration-chunk:\n    GetNextOIDChunk()\
  \ provides versatile iteration meant\n    for multithreaded applications.  Each\
  \ thread fetches\n    a set of OIDs to work with, only returning for more\n    when\
  \ done with that set.  SeqDB guarantees that all\n    OIDs will be assigned, and\
  \ no OID will be returned\n    more than once.\n\n    The data will be returned\
  \ in one of two forms, either\n    as a pair of numbers representing a range of\
  \ OIDs, or\n    in a vector.  The number of OIDs desired is indicated\n    by setting\
  \ the size of the vector on input.\n\n-iteration-simple:\n    CheckOrFindOID() provides\
  \ a simple OID based iteration\n    over the database.  The method works well as\
  \ the test\n    clause of a for loop.  This example counts the number\n    of sequences\
  \ in the \"swissprot\" database, displaying\n    the count and the combined length\
  \ of the first 1000.\n\n-iteration-threaded:\n    GetNextOIDChunk() provides versatile\
  \ iteration meant\n    for multithreaded applications.  Each thread fetches\n  \
  \  a set of OIDs to work with, only returning for more\n    when done with that\
  \ set.  SeqDB guarantees that all\n    OIDs will be assigned, and no OID will be\
  \ returned\n    more than once.\n\n    The data will be returned in one of two forms,\
  \ either\n    as a pair of numbers representing a range of OIDs, or\n    in a vector.\
  \  The number of OIDs desired is indicated\n    by setting the size of the vector\
  \ on input.\n\n-seqid-to-bioseq:\n    SeqidToBioseq() provides a basic interface\
  \ to fetch\n    sequences from a SeqDB object.  Given a Seq-id, the\n    method\
  \ returns the first matching CBioseq found in\n    the database.\n\n"
