  \ <file>\n            Input file in FASTQ format that contains the sequence and\n\
  \            quality data. Use stdin instead of a file name to read from\n     \
  \       STDIN (-fasta stdin). This can be useful to process compressed\n       \
  \     files using Unix pipes.\n\n    -fasta <file>\n            Input file in FASTA\
  \ format that contains the sequence data. Use\n            stdin instead of a file\
  \ name to read from STDIN (-fastq stdin).\n            This can be useful to process\
  \ compressed files using Unix pipes.\n\n    -qual <file>\n            Input file\
  \ in QUAL format that contains the quality data.\n\n    -fastq2 <file>\n       \
  \     For paired-end data only. Input file in FASTQ format that\n            contains\
  \ the sequence and quality data. The sequence identifiers\n            for two matching\
  \ paired-end sequences in separate files can be\n            marked by /1 and /2,\
  \ or _L and _R, or _left and _right, or must\n            have the exact same identifier\
  \ in both input files. The input\n            sequences must be sorted by their\
  \ sequence identifiers.\n            Singletons are allowed in the input files.\n\
  \n    -fasta2 <file>\n            For paired-end data only. Input file in FASTA\
  \ format that\n            contains the sequence data. The sequence identifiers\
  \ for two\n            matching paired-end sequences in separate files can be marked\
  \ by\n            /1 and /2, or _L and _R, or _left and _right, or must have the\n\

  \          must be sorted by their sequence identifiers. Singletons are\n      \
  \      allowed in the input files.\n\n    -params <file>\n            Input file\
  \ in text format that contains PRINSEQ parameters. Each\n            parameter should\
  \ be specified on a new line and arguments should\n            be separated by spaces\
  \ or tabs. Comments can be specified on\n            lines starting with the # sign.\
  \ Can be combined with command\n            line parameters. Parameters specified\
  \ on the command line will\n            overwrite the arguments in the file (if\
  \ any).\n\n    -si13   This option was replaced by option -phred64.\n\n    -phred64\n\
  \            Quality data in FASTQ file is in Phred+64 format\n            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format#Encoding).\

  \            PacBio data.\n\n    -aa     Input is amino acid (protein) sequences\
  \ instead of nucleic acid\n            (DNA or RNA) sequences. Allowed amino acid\
  \ characters:\n            ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTUVWYZXabcdefghiklmmopqrstuvwyzx*-\

  \n    ***** OUTPUT OPTIONS *****\n    -out_format <integer>\n            To change\
  \ the output format, use one of the following options.\n            If not defined,\
  \ the output format will be the same as the input\n            format.\n\n     \
  \       1 (FASTA only), 2 (FASTA and QUAL), 3 (FASTQ), 4 (FASTQ and\n          \
  \  FASTA), or 5 (FASTQ, FASTA and QUAL)\n\n    -out_good <string>\n            By\
  \ default, the output files are created in the same directory\n            as the\
  \ input file containing the sequence data with an\n            additional \"_prinseq_good_XXXX\"\
  \ in their name (where XXXX is\n            replaced by random characters to prevent\
  \ overwriting previous\n            files). To change the output filename and location,\
  \ specify the\n            filename using this option. The file extension will be\
  \ added\n            automatically (either .fasta, .qual, or .fastq). For paired-end\n\
  \            data, filenames contain additionally \"_1\", \"_1_singletons\",\n \
  \           \"_2\", and \"_2_singletons\" before the file extension. Use\n     \
  \       \"-out_good null\" to prevent the program from generating the\n        \
  \    output file(s) for data passing all filters. Use \"-out_good\n            stdout\"\
  \ to write data passing all filters to STDOUT (only for\n            FASTA or FASTQ\
  \ output files).\n\n            Example: use \"file_passed\" to generate the output\
  \ file\n            file_passed.fasta in the current directory\n\n    -out_bad <string>\n\
  \            By default, the output files are created in the same directory\n  \
  \          as the input file containing the sequence data with an\n            additional\
  \ \"_prinseq_bad_XXXX\" in their name (where XXXX is\n            replaced by random\
  \ characters to prevent overwriting previous\n            files). To change the\
  \ output filename and location, specify the\n            filename using this option.\
  \ The file extension will be added\n            automatically (either .fasta, .qual,\
  \ or .fastq). For paired-end\n            data, filenames contain additionally \"\
  _1\" and \"_2\" before the\n            file extension. Use \"-out_bad null\" to\
  \ prevent the program from\n            generating the output file(s) for data not\
  \ passing any filter.\n            Use \"-out_bad stdout\" to write data not passing\
  \ any filter to\n            STDOUT (only for FASTA or FASTQ output files).\n\n\
  \            Example: use \"file_filtered\" to generate the output file\n      \
  \      file_filtered.fasta in the current directory\n\n            Example: \"-out_good\
  \ stdout -out_bad null\" will write data\n            passing filters to STDOUT\
  \ and data not passing any filter will\n            be ignored\n\n    -log <file>\n\
  \            Log file to keep track of parameters, errors, etc. The log file\n \
  \           name is optional. If no file name is given, the log file name\n    \
  \        will be \"inputname.log\". If the log file already exists, new\n      \
  \      content will be added to the file.\n\n    -graph_data <file>\n          \
  \  File that contains the necessary information to generate the\n            graphs\
  \ similar to the ones in the web version. The file name is\n            optional.\
  \ If no file name is given, the file name will be\n            \"inputname.gd\"\
  . If the file already exists, new content will\n            overwrite the file.\
  \ Use \"-out_good null -out_bad null\" to\n            prevent generating any additional\
  \ outputs. (See below for more\n            options related to the graph data.)\n\
  \n            The graph data can be used as input for the prinseq-graphs.pl\n  \
  \          file to generate the PNG graph files or an HTML report file. If\n   \
  \         you have trouble installing the required prinseq-graphs.pl\n         \
  \   modules or want to see an output example report, upload the\n            graph\
  \ data file at: http://edwards.sdsu.edu/prinseq/ -> Choose\n            \"Get Report\"\
  \n\n    -graph_stats <string>\n            Use this option to select what statistics\
  \ should be calculated\n            and included in the graph_data file. This is\
  \ useful if you e.g.\n            do not need sequence complexity information, which\
  \ requires a\n            lot of computation. Requires to have graph_data specified.\n\
  \            Default is all selected.\n\n            Allowed option are (separate\
  \ multiple by comma with no spaces):\n            ld (Length distribution), gc (GC\
  \ content distribution), qd (Base\n            quality distribution), ns (Occurence\
  \ of N), pt (Poly-A/T tails),\n            ts (Tag sequence check), aq (Assembly\
  \ quality measure), de\n            (Sequence duplication - exact only), da (Sequence\
  \ duplication -\n            exact + 5'/3'), sc (Sequence complexity), dn (Dinucleotide\
  \ odds\n            ratios, includes the PCA plots)\n\n            Example use:\
  \ -graph_stats ld,gc,qd,de\n\n    -qual_noscale\n            Use this option if\
  \ all your sequences are shorter than 100bp as\n            they do not require\
  \ to scale quality data to 100 data points in\n            the graph. By default,\
  \ quality scores of sequences shorter than\n            100bp or longer than 100bp\
  \ are fit to 100 data points. (To\n            retrieve this information and calculate\
  \ the graph data would\n            otherwise require to parse the data two times\
  \ or store all the\n            quality data in memory.)\n\n    -no_qual_header\n\
  \            In order to reduce the file size, this option will generate an\n  \
  \          empty header line for the quality data in FASTQ files. Instead\n    \
  \        of +header, only the + sign will be output. The header of the\n       \
  \     sequence data will be left unchanged. This option applies to\n           \
  \ FASTQ output files only.\n\n    -exact_only\n            Use this option to check\
  \ for exact (forward and reverse)\n            duplicates only when generating the\
  \ graph data. This allows to\n            keep the memory requirements low for large\
  \ input files and is\n            faster. This option will automatically be applied\
  \ when using\n            -derep options 1 and/or 4 only. Specify option -derep\
  \ 1 or\n            -derep 4 if you do not want to apply both at the same time.\n\
  \n    -seq_id_mappings <file>\n            Text file containing the old and new\
  \ (specified with -seq_id)\n            identifiers for later reference. This option\
  \ is useful if e.g. a\n            renamed sequence has to be identified based on\
  \ the new sequence\n            identifier. The file name is optional. If no file\
  \ name is given,\n            the file name will be \"inputname_prinseq_good.ids\"\
  \ (only good\n            sequences are renamed). If a file with the same name already\n\
  \            exists, new content will overwrite the old file. The text file\n  \
  \          contains one sequence identifier pair per line, separated by\n      \
  \      tabs (old-tab-new). Requires option -seq_id.\n\n    ***** FILTER OPTIONS\
  \ *****\n    -min_len <integer>\n            Filter sequence shorter than min_len.\n\
  \n    -max_len <integer>\n            Filter sequence longer than max_len.\n\n \
  \   -range_len <string>\n            Filter sequence by length range. Multiple range\
  \ values should be\n            separated by comma without spaces.\n\n         \
  \   Example: -range_len 50-100,250-300\n\n    -min_gc <integer>\n            Filter\
  \ sequence with GC content below min_gc.\n\n    -max_gc <integer>\n            Filter\
  \ sequence with GC content above max_gc.\n\n    -range_gc <string>\n           \
  \ Filter sequence by GC content range. Multiple range values\n            should\
  \ be separated by comma without spaces.\n\n            Example: -range_gc 50-60,75-90\n\
  \n    -min_qual_score <integer>\n            Filter sequence with at least one quality\
  \ score below\n            min_qual_score.\n\n    -max_qual_score <integer>\n  \
  \          Filter sequence with at least one quality score above\n            max_qual_score.\n\
  \n    -min_qual_mean <integer>\n            Filter sequence with quality score mean\
  \ below min_qual_mean.\n\n    -max_qual_mean <integer>\n            Filter sequence\
  \ with quality score mean above max_qual_mean.\n\n    -ns_max_p <integer>\n    \
  \        Filter sequence with more than ns_max_p percentage of Ns.\n\n    -ns_max_n\
  \ <integer>\n            Filter sequence with more than ns_max_n Ns.\n\n    -noniupac\n\
  \            Filter sequence with characters other than A, C, G, T or N.\n\n   \
  \ -seq_num <integer>\n            Only keep the first seq_num number of sequences\
  \ (that pass all\n            other filters).\n\n    -derep <integer>\n        \
  \    Type of duplicates to filter. Allowed values are 1, 2, 3, 4 and\n         \
  \   5. Use integers for multiple selections (e.g. 124 to use type 1,\n         \
  \   2 and 4). The order does not matter. Option 2 and 3 will set 1\n           \
  \ and option 5 will set 4 as these are subsets of the other\n            option.\n\
  \n            1 (exact duplicate), 2 (5' duplicate), 3 (3' duplicate), 4\n     \
  \       (reverse complement exact duplicate), 5 (reverse complement\n          \
  \  5'/3' duplicate)\n\n    -derep_min <integer>\n            This option specifies\
  \ the number of allowed duplicates. If you\n            want to remove sequence\
  \ duplicates that occur more than x times,\n            then you would specify x+1\
  \ as the -derep_min values. For\n            examples, to remove sequences that\
  \ occur more than 5 times, you\n            would specify -derep_min 6. This option\
  \ can only be used in\n            combination with -derep 1 and/or 4 (forward and/or\
  \ reverse exact\n            duplicates). [default : 2]\n\n    -lc_method <string>\n\
  \            Method to filter low complexity sequences. The current options\n  \
  \          are \"dust\" and \"entropy\". Use \"-lc_method dust\" to calculate the\n\
  \            complexity using the dust method.\n\n    -lc_threshold <integer>\n\
  \            The threshold value (between 0 and 100) used to filter sequences\n\
  \            by sequence complexity. The dust method uses this as maximum\n    \
  \        allowed score and the entropy method as minimum allowed value.\n\n    -custom_params\
  \ <string>\n            Can be used to specify additional filters. The current set\
  \ of\n            possible rules is limited and has to follow the specifications\n\
  \            below. The custom parameters have to be specified within quotes\n \
  \           (either ' or \").\n\n            Please separate parameter values with\
  \ a space and separate new\n            parameter sets with semicolon (;). Parameters\
  \ are defined by two\n            values: (1) the pattern (any combination of the\
  \ letters\n            \"ACGTN\"), (2) the number of repeats or percentage of occurence\n\
  \            Percentage values are defined by a number followed by the %-sign\n\
  \            (without space). If no %-sign is given, it is assumed that the\n  \
  \          given number specifies the number of repeats of the pattern.\n\n    \
  \        Examples: \"AAT 10\" (filters out sequences containing\n            AATAATAATAATAATAATAATAATAATAAT\
  \ anywhere in the sequence), \"T\n            70%\" (filters out sequences with\
  \ more than 70% Ts in the\n            sequence), \"A 15\" (filters out sequences\
  \ containing\n            AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA anywhere in the sequence), \"AAT 10;T\
  \ 70%;A 15\"\n            (apply all three filters)\n\n    ***** TRIM OPTIONS *****\n\
  \    -trim_to_len <integer>\n            Trim all sequence from the 3'-end to result\
  \ in sequence with\n            this length.\n\n    -trim_left <integer>\n     \
  \       Trim sequence at the 5'-end by trim_left positions.\n\n    -trim_right <integer>\n\

  \ <integer>\n            Trim sequence at the 5'-end by trim_left_p percentage of\
  \ read\n            length. The trim length is rounded towards the lower integer\n\
  \            (e.g. 143.6 is rounded to 143 positions). Use an integer between\n\
  \            1 and 100 for the percentage value.\n\n    -trim_right_p <integer>\n\
  \            Trim sequence at the 3'-end by trim_right_p percentage of read\n  \
  \          length. The trim length is rounded towards the lower integer\n      \
  \      (e.g. 143.6 is rounded to 143 positions). Use an integer between\n      \
  \      1 and 100 for the percentage value.\n\n    -trim_tail_left <integer>\n  \
  \          Trim poly-A/T tail with a minimum length of trim_tail_left at\n     \
  \       the 5'-end.\n\n    -trim_tail_right <integer>\n            Trim poly-A/T\
  \ tail with a minimum length of trim_tail_right at\n            the 3'-end.\n\n\
  \    -trim_ns_left <integer>\n            Trim poly-N tail with a minimum length\

  \            Trim poly-N tail with a minimum length of trim_ns_right at the\n  \
  \          3'-end.\n\n    -trim_qual_left <integer>\n            Trim sequence by\
  \ quality score from the 5'-end with this\n            threshold score.\n\n    -trim_qual_right\
  \ <integer>\n            Trim sequence by quality score from the 3'-end with this\n\
  \            threshold score.\n\n    -trim_qual_type <string>\n            Type\
  \ of quality score calculation to use. Allowed options are\n            min, mean,\
  \ max and sum. [default: min]\n\n    -trim_qual_rule <string>\n            Rule\
  \ to use to compare quality score to calculated value.\n            Allowed options\
  \ are lt (less than), gt (greater than) and et\n            (equal to). [default:\
  \ lt]\n\n    -trim_qual_window <integer>\n            The sliding window size used\
  \ to calculate quality score by type.\n            To stop at the first base that\
  \ fails the rule defined, use a\n            window size of 1. [default: 1]\n\n\
  \    -trim_qual_step <integer>\n            Step size used to move the sliding window.\
  \ To move the window\n            over all quality scores without missing any, the\
  \ step size\n            should be less or equal to the window size. [default: 1]\n\
  \n    ***** REFORMAT OPTIONS *****\n    -seq_case <string>\n            Changes\
  \ sequence character case to upper or lower case. Allowed\n            options are\
  \ \"upper\" and \"lower\". Use this option to remove\n            soft-masking from\
  \ your sequences.\n\n    -dna_rna <string>\n            Convert sequence between\
  \ DNA and RNA. Allowed options are \"dna\"\n            (convert from RNA to DNA)\
  \ and \"rna\" (convert from DNA to RNA).\n\n    -line_width <integer>\n        \
  \    Sequence characters per line. Use 0 if you want each sequence in\n        \
  \    a single line. Use 80 for line breaks every 80 characters. Note\n         \
  \   that this option only applies to FASTA output files, since FASTQ\n         \
  \   files store sequences without additional line breaks. [default:\n          \
  \  60]\n\n    -rm_header\n            Remove the sequence header. This includes\
  \ everything after the\n            sequence identifier (which is kept unchanged).\n\
  \n    -seq_id <string>\n            Rename the sequence identifier. A counter is\
  \ added to each\n            identifier to assure its uniqueness. Use option -seq_id_mappings\n\
  \            to generate a file containing the old and new identifiers for\n   \
  \         later reference.\n\n            Example: \"mySeq_10\" will generate the\
  \ IDs (in FASTA format)\n            >mySeq_101, >mySeq_102, >mySeq_103, ...\n\n\
  \    ***** SUMMARY STATISTIC OPTIONS *****\n            The summary statistic values\
  \ are written to STDOUT in the form:\n            \"parameter_name statistic_name\
  \ value\" (without the quotes). For\n            example, \"stats_info reads 10000\"\
  \ or \"stats_len max 500\". Only\n            one statistic is written per line\
  \ and values are separated by\n            tabs.\n\n            If you specify any\
  \ statistic option, no other ouput will be\n            generated. To preprocess\
  \ data, do not specify a statistics\n            option.\n\n    -stats_info\n  \
  \          Outputs basic information such as number of reads (reads) and\n     \
  \       total bases (bases).\n\n    -stats_len\n            Outputs minimum (min),\
  \ maximum (max), range (range), mean\n            (mean), standard deviation (stddev),\
  \ mode (mode) and mode value\n            (modeval), and median (median) for read\
  \ length.\n\n    -stats_dinuc\n            Outputs the dinucleotide odds ratio for\
  \ AA/TT (aatt), AC/GT\n            (acgt), AG/CT (agct), AT (at), CA/TG (catg),\
  \ CC/GG (ccgg), CG\n            (cg), GA/TC (gatc), GC (gc) and TA (ta).\n\n   \
  \ -stats_tag\n            Outputs the probability of a tag sequence at the 5'-end\
  \ (prob5)\n            and 3'-end (prob3) in percentage (0..100). Provides the number\n\
  \            of predefined MIDs (midnum) and the MID sequences (midseq,\n      \
  \      separated by comma, only provided if midnum > 0) that occur in\n        \
  \    more than 34/100 (approx. 3%) of the reads.\n\n    -stats_dupl\n          \
  \  Outputs the number of exact duplicates (exact), 5' duplicates\n            (5),\
  \ 3' duplicates (3), exact duplicates with reverse\n            complements (exactrevcom)\
  \ and 5'/3' duplicates with reverse\n            complements (revcomp), and total\
  \ number of duplicates (total).\n            The maximum number of duplicates is\
  \ given under the value name\n            with an additional \"maxd\" (e.g. exactmaxd\
  \ or 5maxd).\n\n    -stats_ns\n            Outputs the number of reads with ambiguous\
  \ base N (seqswithn),\n            the maximum number of Ns per read (maxn) and\
  \ the maximum\n            percentage of Ns per read (maxp). The maxn and maxp value\
  \ are\n            not necessary from the same sequence.\n\n    -stats_assembly\n\
  \            Outputs the N50, N90, etc contig sizes. The Nxx contig size is a\n\
  \            weighted median that is defined as the length of the smallest\n   \
  \         contig C in the sorted list of all contigs where the cumulative\n    \
  \        length from the largest contig to contig C is at least xx% of\n       \
  \     the total length (sum of contig lengths).\n\n    -stats_all\n            Outputs\
  \ all available summary statistics.\n\n    ***** ORDER OF PROCESSING *****\n   \
