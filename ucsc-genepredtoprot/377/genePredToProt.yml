help_text: "genePredToProt - create protein sequences by translating gene annotations\n\
  usage:\n   genePredToProt genePredFile genomeSeqs protFa\n\nThis honors frame if\
  \ genePred has frames, dropping partial codons.\ngenomeSeqs is a 2bit or directory\
  \ of nib files.\n\noptions:\n  -cdsFa=fasta - output FASTA with CDS that was used\
  \ to generate protein.\n                 This will not include dropped partial codons.\n\
  \  -protIdSuffix=str - add this string to the end of the name for protein FASTA\n\
  \  -cdsIdSuffix=str - add this string to the end of the name for CDS FASTA\n  -translateSeleno\
  \ - assume internal TGA code for selenocysteine and translate to `U'.\n  -includeStop\
  \ - If the CDS ends with a stop codon, represent it as a `*'\n  -starForInframeStops\
  \ - use `*' instead of `X' for in-frame stop codons.\n                  This will\
  \ result in selenocysteine's being `*', with only codons\n                  containing\
  \ `N' being translated to `X'.  This doesn't include terminal\n                \
