help_text: "WiggleTools\n\nCopyright [1999-2017] EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute\n\
  Development contact: Daniel Zerbino zerbino@ebi.ac.uk\n\nCitation: Zerbino DR, Johnson\
  \ N, Juettemann T, Wilder SP and Flicek PR: WiggleTools: parallel processing of\
  \ large collections of genome-wide datasets for visualization and statistical analysis.\
  \ Bioinformatics 2014 30:1008-1009.\n\nThis library parses wiggle files and executes\
  \ various operations on them streaming through lazy evaluators.\n\nInputs:\n\tThe\
  \ program takes in Wig, BigWig, BedGraph, Bed, BigBed, Bam, VCF, and BCF files,\
  \ which are distinguished thanks to their suffix (.wig, (.bw|.bigWig|.bigwig), .bg,\
  \ .bed, .bb, .bam, .cram, .vcf, .bcf respectively).\n\tNote that wiggletools assumes\
  \ that every bam file has an index .bai file next to it.\n\nOutputs:\n\tThe program\
  \ outputs a wiggle file in stdout unless the output is squashed\n\nCommand line:\n\
