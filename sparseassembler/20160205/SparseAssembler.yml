  \ TrimN TRIM_READS_WITH_N f INPUT_FILE1 f INPUT_FILE2 i1 INWARD_PAIR_END1 i2 INWARD_PAIR_END2\
  \ o1 OUTWARD_PAIR_END1 o2 OUTWARD_PAIR_END2\n\nParameters:\nk: kmer size, support\
  \ 15~127.\ng: number of skipped intermediate k-mers, support 1-25.\nf: single end\
  \ reads. Multiple inputs shall be independently imported with this parameter.\n\
  i1 & i2 (or p1 & p2): inward paired-end reads.\no1 & o2 (or l1 & l2): outward paired-end\
  \ reads.\nGS: genome size estimation in bp (used for memory pre-allocation), suggest\
  \ a large value if possible.(e.g. ~ 2x genome size)\nLD: load a saved k-mer graph.\
  \ \nBC: 1: build contigs.0: don't build.\nKmerTable: 1 if you want to output the\
  \ kmer table.\nNodeCovTh: coverage threshold for spurious k-mers, support 0-16.\
  \ (default 1)\nEdgeCovTh: coverage threshold for spurious links, support 0-16. (default\
  \ 0)\nPathCovTh: coverage threshold for spurious paths in the breadth-first search,\
  \ support 0-100.\nTrimLen: trim long sequences to this length.\nTrimN: throw away\
  \ reads with more than this number of Ns.\nTrimQual: trim off tails with quality\
  \ scores lower than this.\nQualBase: lowest quality score value (in ASCII value)\
  \ in the current fastq scoring system, default: '!'.\n\nFor error correction:\n\
  Denoise: use 1 to call the error correction module. (default 0)\nH: hybrid mode.\
  \ 0 (Default): reads will be trimmed at the ends to ensure denoising accuracy (*MUST*\
  \ set 0 for the last round). 1: reads will not be trimmed at the ends; \nCovTh:\
  \ coverage threshold for an error. A k-mer with coverage < this value will be checked.\
  \ Setting 0 will allow the program to choose a value based on the coverage histogram.\n\
  CorrTh: coverage threshold for a correct k-mer candidate. A k-mer with coverage\
  \ >= this value will be considered a candidate for correction. Setting 0 will allow\
  \ the program to choose a value based on the coverage histogram.\n\nFor scaffolding:\n\
  ExpCov: expected average k-mer coverage in a unique contig. Used for scaffolding.\n\
  Scaffold: 1: scaffolding with paired reads. 0: single end assembly.\nLinkCovTh:\
  \ coverage threshold for spurious paired-end links, support 0-100. (default 5)\n\
  Iter_Scaffold: 1: iterative scaffolding using the already built scaffolds (/super\
  \ contigs). 0: one round scaffolding.\nFor mate pair scaffolding:\nInsertSize: estimated\
  \ insert size of the current pair.\ni1_mp & i2_mp: inward mate paired reads (large\
  \ insert sizes >10k, for shorter libraries omit \"_mp\").\no1_mp & o2_mp : outward\
  \ paired-end reads (large insert sizes >10k, for shorter libraries omit \"_mp\"\
  ).\n\nError! Genome size not given.\n"
