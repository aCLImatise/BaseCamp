  \ Unique reads for qseq/fastq/fasta/sequence.\n       Low quality reads in qseq\
  \ file can be filtered.\nWarning: This function is reserved for WGBS, but not for\
  \ RRBS. \n   For WGBS, user can also try 'samtools rmdup' to get unique reads using\
  \ BAM files. \n   For RRBS, it is suggested not to get unique reads, as the starting\
  \ ends of reads\n are more likely to be same for the reads from one C-CCG~~~C-CGG\
  \ fragment.\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\n  -i FILE\
