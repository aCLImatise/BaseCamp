help_text: "Usage:\n    plot_bmprobs <in> <out>\n\n    Read a file <in> with base\
  \ match probabilites and write plot as ps file\n    <out>.\n\n    The in-file is\
  \ supposed to contain lines of the form <i> <j> <p_ij>\n    where i is a position\
  \ in the first dimension (usually first sequence)\n    and j a position in the second\
  \ dimension (second sequence). p_ij is the\n    probability to match the positions,\
  \ i.e. we expect 0<=p_ij<=1.\n\n    The script requires the statistic program R\
  \ (must be in the search path)\n    for generating the plot.\n\n    Options: --help\
