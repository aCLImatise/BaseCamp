  \ <experimental bedgraph>.bg [<control bedgraph>.bg | <FDR threshold>] [norm | non]\
  \ [relaxed | stringent] output prefix\n\t\n\tDescription of input fields:\n\t\n\t\
  Field 1: Target data bedgraph file in UCSC bedgraph format (https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bedgraph.html)\
  \ that omits regions containing 0 signal.\n\t\n\tField 2: Control (IgG) data bedgraph\
  \ file to generate an empirical threshold for peak calling. Alternatively, a numeric\
  \ threshold n between 0 and 1 returns the top n fraction of peaks based on total\
  \ signal within peaks.\n\t\n\tField 3: “norm” denotes normalization of control to\
  \ target data, “non” skips this behavior. norm is recommended unless experimental\
  \ and control data are already rigorously normalized to each other (e.g. via spike-in).\n\
  \t\t\n\tField 4: “relaxed” uses a total signal threshold between the knee and peak\
  \ of the total signal curve, and corresponds to the “relaxed” mode described in\
  \ the text, whereas “stringent” uses the peak of the curve, and corresponds to “stringent”\
  \ mode.\n\t\n\tField 5: Output prefix\n\t\n\tOutput file:\n\t<output prefix>.auc.threshold.merge.bed\
  \ (Bed file of enriched regions)\n\t\n\tOutput data structure: \n\t\n\t<chr>\t<start>\t\
  <end>\t<AUC>\t<max signal>\t<max signal region>\n\t\n\tDescription of output fields:\n\
  \tField 1: Chromosome\n\t\n\tField 2: Start coordinate\n\t\n\tField 3: End coordinate\n\
  \t\n\tField 4: Total signal contained within denoted coordinates\n\t\n\tField 5:\
  \ Maximum bedgraph signal attained at any base pair within denoted coordinates\n\
  \t\n\tField 6: Region representing the farthest upstream and farthest downstream\
  \ bases within the denoted coordinates that are represented by the maximum bedgraph\
  \ signal\n\t\n\tExamples:\n\tbash SEACR_1.3.sh target.bedgraph IgG.bedgraph norm\

  \ control track with stringent threshold\n\t\n\tbash SEACR_1.3.sh target.bedgraph\

  \ non-normalized IgG control track with relaxed threshold\n\tbash SEACR_1.3.sh target.bedgraph\
  \ 0.01 non stringent output\n\tCalls enriched regions in target data by selecting\
