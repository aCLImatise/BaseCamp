help_text: "transMapPslToGenePred - convert PSL alignments of mRNAs to gene annotations.\n\
  \nusage:\n   mrnaToGene [options] sourceGenePred mappedPsl mappedGenePred\n\nConvert\
  \ PSL alignments from transmap to genePred.  It specifically handles\nalignments\
  \ where the source genes are genomic annotations in genePred\nformat, that are converted\
  \ to PSL for mapping and using this program to\ncreate a new genePred.\n\nThis is\
  \ an alternative to mrnaToGene which determines CDS and frame from\nthe original\
  \ annotation, which may have been imported from GFF/GTF.  This\nwas created because\
  \ the genbankCds structure use by mrnaToGene doesn't\nhandle partial start/stop\
  \ codon or programmed frame shifts.  This requires\nhandling the list of CDS regions\
  \ and the /codon_start attribute,  At some\npoint, this program may be extended\
  \ to do handle genbank alignments correctly.\n\nOptions:\n  -nonCodingGapFillMax=0\
  \ - fill gaps in non-coding regions up to this many bases\n   in length.\n  -codingGapFillMax=0\
  \ - fill gaps in coding regions up to this many bases\n   in length.  Only coding\
  \ gaps that are a multiple of three will be fill,\n   with the max rounded down.\n\
  \  -noBlockMerge - don't do any block merging of genePred, even of adjacent blocks.\n\
  \   This is mainly for debugging.\n\n\n"
