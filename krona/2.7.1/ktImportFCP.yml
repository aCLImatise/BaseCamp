  description: Results of running any FCP classification tool (except BLASTN.py, which
    only outputs raw BLAST results). By default, separate datasets will be created
    for each input (see [-c]).

- !Positional
  description: Optional file listing query IDs with magnitudes, separated by tabs.
    This can be used to account for read length or contig depth to obtain a more accurate
    representation of abundance. By default, query sequences without specified magnitudes
    will be assigned a magnitude of 1. Magnitude files for assemblies in ACE format
    can be created with ktGetContigMagnitudes.

- !Positional
  description: A name to show in the list of datasets in the Krona chart (if multiple
    input files are present and [-c] is not specified). By default, the basename of
    the file will be used. _________
