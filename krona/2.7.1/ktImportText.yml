  description: Tab-delimited text file. Each line should be a number followed by a
    list of wedges to contribute to (starting from the highest level). If no wedges
    are listed (and just a quantity is given), it will contribute to the top level.
    If the same lineage is listed more than once, the values will be added. Quantities
    can be omitted if -q is specified. Lines beginning with "#" will be ignored. By
    default, separate datasets will be created for each input (see [-c]).
