  description: Tabular file whose fields are [query, subject, score]. Subject must
    be an accession or contain one in the fourth field of pipe notation (e.g. "gi|12345|xx|ABC123.1|".
    The subject and score can be omitted to include a query that has no hits, which
    will be assigned a taxonomy ID of -1. By default, separate datasets will be created
    for each input (see [-c]).

- !Positional
  description: Optional file listing query IDs with magnitudes, separated by tabs.
    This can be used to account for read length or contig depth to obtain a more accurate
    representation of abundance. By default, query sequences without specified magnitudes
    will be assigned a magnitude of 1. Magnitude files for assemblies in ACE format
    can be created with ktGetContigMagnitudes.

  description: A name to show in the list of datasets in the Krona chart (if multiple
    input files are present and [-c] is not specified). By default, the basename of
    the file will be used. _________
