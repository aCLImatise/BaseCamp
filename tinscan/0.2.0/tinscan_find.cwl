- id: no_flanks
  doc: If set, do not report flanking hit regions in GFF.
  type: boolean

- id: max_tsd
  doc: 'Maximum overlap of insertion flanking sequences in QUERY genome to be considered
    as target site duplication. Flank pairs with greater overlaps will be discarded
    Note: Setting this value too high may result in tandem duplications in the target
    genome being falsely classified as insertion events.'

  inputBinding:
    prefix: --maxTSD

  doc: Maximum length of sequence to consider as an insertion event.
  type: long
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --maxInsert
- id: min_insert
  doc: 'Minimum length of sequence to consider as an insertion event. Note: If too
    short may detect small non-TE indels.'

  inputBinding:
    prefix: --minInsert
- id: q_gap
  doc: Maximum gap allowed between aligned flanks in QUERY sequence. Equivalent to
    target sequence deleted upon insertion event.

    prefix: --qGap
- id: mini_dent
  doc: Minimum identity for a hit to be considered.
  type: long
  inputBinding:
