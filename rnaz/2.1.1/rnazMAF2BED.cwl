  doc: Specify the sequence identifier of the sequence which should be used as a reference
    to create the output. Use for example "hg17" if you want to get all sequences
    containing "hg17" in the idenitfier (e.g. "hg17.chr10", "hg17.chr22",...). If
    this option is omitted, the first sequence identifier of the first sequence in
    the first alignment block is used.
