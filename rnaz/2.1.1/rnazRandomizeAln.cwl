  doc: Long alignment blocks should be shuffled locally in order to maintain local
    characteristics of the alignment. Therefore alignments can be shuffled in windows.
    You can specify here the size of a window and the offset. Defaults are window=120
    and slide=120, i.e. the alignments are shuffled in non-overlapping windows of
    120 columns.

  doc: 'The shuffling algorithm tries to mantain local conservation patterns, i.e.
    it shuffles only columns of the same degree of conservation. This becomes limiting
    if you have many sequences in your alignment. Therfore you can choose the level
    of ``coarse graining" with this option. To decide which columns have the same
    degree of conservation, the mean pairwise identity (MPI) of each column is calculated
    and finally only columns of the same value are shuffled. You can adjust the rounding
    of the MPI and thus the ``coarse graining" level with this option. If you have
    two columns with say 0.52 and 0.48 MPI you get: level 0: 1 and 0 level 1: 50 and
    50 level 2: 52 and 48 So on level 0 you only have ``conserved" (MPI > 0.5) and
    ``non-conserved" (MPI < 0.5) columns while on level 2 you need almost exactly
    the same MPI to shuffle two columns. Default value is 2.'
