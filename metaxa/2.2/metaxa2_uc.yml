help_text: "Usage: metaxa2_uc -i <input file> -o <output file>\nOptions:\n-i {file}\
  \ : Input count table (e.g. derived from metaxa2_dc)\n-o {file} : Base for the names\
  \ of output file(s)\n-g {file,string,auto,none,all} : A file or string describing\
  \ the sample group division,\n                             or 'auto' if the groups\
  \ should be guessed from sample names,\n                             or 'none' if\
  \ all samples should be treated individually,\n                             or 'all'\
  \ if all samples should be treated as they come from the same group, default = 'all'\n\
  \n-r {value} : Number of resampling rounds for each sample, default = 10000\n-s\
  \ {value,min} : Number of entries sampled in each resampling round for each sample,\
  \ 'min' will set this number to the number of entries in the smallest sample, default\
  \ = 1000\n-c {string} : Sample to compare to, leave blank to compare to all samples,\
  \ use 'groups' to compare groups instead of samples, default is blank\n-w {value}\
  \ : Within-sample variation cutoff to compare to (proportion of all resampling values\
  \ included), default = 0.99\n-m {empirical,average,model} : Resampling model to\
  \ use, default = model\n                               Empirical uses the empirical\
  \ distribution from each sample within the group, which gives large variance (not\
  \ statistical good-practice)\n                               Average assumes that\
  \ all samples are drawn directly from the group average, which gives very small\
  \ variance (unrealistic)\n                               Model assumes a model that\
  \ take sample variation into account when drawing from the group average, which\
  \ gives very variance (more realistic)\n-d {bray,jaccard,euclidean} : Distance/dissimilarity\
  \ measure to use when comparing samples and groups, default = bray\n--binary {T\
  \ or F} : Use presence/absence for distance/dissimilarity rather than taking abundances\
  \ into account, off (F) by default\n--filter {value} : Filter out abundance values\
  \ below this cutoff, default = 0\n\n--summary {T or F} : Outputs a readable summary\
  \ file of the results, on (T) by default\n--table {T or F} : Outputs a tab-separated\
  \ table of the results, off (F) by default\n--matrix {T or F} : Outputs a results\
  \ in a matrix format, off (F) by default\n--resampling_table {T or F} : Outputs\
  \ the resampling table (can be huge), off (F) by default\n\n-h : displays short\
  \ usage information\n--help : displays this help message\n--bugs : displays the\
  \ bug fixes and known bugs in this version of Metaxa\n--license : displays licensing\
