help_text: "Usage: <samplesize> <region in base pairs> [options]\nOptions: \n-s <random\
  \ seed>\n-d enable debugging messages\n-i <iterations>\n-t <mu> (mutation rate per\
  \ site per 2N generations)\n-C <clonalFrame> (the input clonal frame to fix simulations\
  \ on, sample names must be integers from 0 on)\n-b <b> (burn in: sequence length\
  \ in base pairs to be used to initialize the recombination process)\n-r <r> <lambda>\
  \ (r = recombination (gene conversion) initiation rate per-individual, per-base\
  \ pair, per-2N generations; lambda = mean length of recombination tract in base\
  \ pairs)\n-x <r2> <lambda2> (r2 = between-species recombination (gene conversion)\
  \ initiation rate per-individual, per-base pair, per-2N generations; lambda2 = mean\
  \ length of between-species recombination tract in base pairs)\n-T (Print each local\
  \ tree in Newick format to standard out)\n-R <inputfilename> (Tab delimited file\
  \ where first two columns indicate range of base pair positions scaled to the unit\
  \ interval and last column is ratio with respect to base line recombination rate)\n\
  -F <inputfilename> [0|1] (Tab delimited frequency distribution file where first\
  \ column indicate range of SNP allele frequencies from previous row to current row\
  \ and last column is desired bin frequency. Second parameter is 1 if SNPs with derived\
  \ allele freq > 1.0 should have alleles flipped, 0 otherwise)\n-G <alpha> (Assign\
  \ growth rate alpha across populations where alpha=-log(Np/Nr) )\n-I <n> <n1> <n2>\
  \ .. <mig_rate> (Assign all elements of the migration matrix for n populations.\
