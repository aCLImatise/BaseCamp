help_text: "starch-diff\n  citation: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/14/1919.abstract\n\
  \  version:  2.4.39\n  authors:  Alex Reynolds and Shane Neph\n\n  $ starch-diff\
  \ [ --chr <chr> ] starch-file-1 starch-file-2 [ starch-file-3 ... ]\n\n  The 'starch-diff'\
  \ utility compares the signatures of two or more specified \n  Starch v2.2+ archives\
  \ for all chromosomes, or for a specified chromosome.\n  \n  The typical output\
  \ of 'starch-diff' is a message indicating that the \n  archives' chromosome(s)\
  \ are identical or dissimilar, written to the standard\n  error stream.\n  \n  In\
  \ addition, if all chromosomes are identical, 'starch-diff' exits with a \n  zero\
  \ status code. Likewise, if any chromosomes are dissimilar, 'starch-diff'\n  exits\
  \ with a non-zero status code. This facilitates testing in a scripting\n  environment.\n"
