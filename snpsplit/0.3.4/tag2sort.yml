help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\n  This script processes allele tagged input files produced\
  \ by SNPsplit and sorts the 'allele_tagged.bam'\n  file into several sub-files,\
  \ depending on the experiment type and options selected. By default reads are\n\
  \  written to the following files:\n\n   ... _genome1.bam\n   ... _genome2.bam\n\
  \   ... _unassigned.bam\n\n  For more information on sorting options pelase refer\
  \ to the SNPsplit documentation.\n\n\n  USAGE: tag2sort [options] [SNPsplit tagged\
  \ input file(s)]\n\nSNPsplit tagged input file(s): These files are required to be\
  \ SAM/BAM files that contain the\noptional field XX:Z: produced by the SNPsplit-flag\
  \ module. The tags indicate if a read could\nbe assigned to a specific allele, and\
  \ they are one of the following:\n\n                             XX:Z:UA - Unassigned\n\
  \                             XX:Z:G1 - Genome 1-specific\n                    \
  \         XX:Z:G2 - Genome 2-specific\n                             XX:Z:CF - Conflicting\n\
  \n--paired               Paired-end mode. (Default: OFF).\n\n-o/--outdir <dir> \
  \     Write all output files into this directory. By default the output files will\
  \ be written into\n                       the same folder as the input file(s).\n\
  \n--singletons           If the allele-tagged paired-end file also contains singleton\
  \ alignments (which is the\n                       default for e.g. TopHat), these\
  \ will be written out to extra files (ending in _st.bam)\n                     \
  \  instead of writing everything to combined paired-end and singleton files. Default:\
  \ OFF.\n\n--hic                  Assumes Hi-C data processed with HiCUP (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/hicup/)\n\
  \                       as input, i.e. the input BAM file is paired-end and Reads\
  \ 1 and 2 follow each other. Thus,\n                       this option also sets\
  \ the flags --paired and --no_sort. Default: OFF.\n\n--samtools_path        The\
  \ path to your Samtools installation, e.g. /home/user/samtools/. Does not need to\n\
  \                       be specified explicitly if Samtools is in the PATH already.\n\
  \n--conflicting/--weird  Reads or read pairs that were classified as 'Conflicting'\
  \ (XX:Z:CF) will be written to\n                       an extra file (ending in\
  \ .conflicting.bam) instead of being simply skipped. Reads may be\n            \
  \           classified as 'Conflicting' if a single read contains SNP information\
  \ for both genomes at\n                       the same time, or if the SNP position\
  \ was deleted from the read. Read-pairs are considered\n                       'Conflicting'\
  \ if either read is was tagged with the XX:Z:CF flag. Default: OFF.\n\n--help  \
  \               Displays this help information and exits.\n\n--version         \
  \     Displays version information and exits.\n\n\n\n                          Script\
