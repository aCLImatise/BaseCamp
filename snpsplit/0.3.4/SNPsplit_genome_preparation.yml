help_text: "\n  SYNOPSIS:\n\nSNPsplit_genome_preparation is designed to read in a\
  \ variant call files from the Mouse Genomes Project (e.g. this latest\nfile: 'mgp.v5.merged.snps_all.dbSNP142.vcf.gz')\
  \ and generate new genome versions where the strain SNPs are either incorporated\n\
  into the new genome (full sequence) or masked by the ambiguity nucleo-base 'N' (N-masking).\n\
  \nSNPsplit_genome_preparation may be run in two different modes:\n\nSingle strain\
  \ mode:\n\n   1) The VCF file is read and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in the\
  \ strain specified with --strain <name>\n   2) The reference genome (given with\
  \ --reference_genome <genome>) is read into memory, and the filtered high-\n   \
  \   confidence SNP positions are incorporated either as N-masking (default) or full\
  \ sequence (option --full_sequence)\n\nDual strain mode:\n\n   1) The VCF file is\
  \ read and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in the strain specified with --strain\
  \ <name>\n   2) The reference genome (given with --reference_genome <genome>) is\
  \ read into memory, and the filtered high-\n      confidence SNP positions are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n   3) The VCF file is read one more\
  \ time and filtered for high-confidence SNPs in strain 2 specified with --strain2\
  \ <name>\n   4) The filtered high-confidence SNP positions of strain 2 are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n   5) The SNP information of strain\
  \ and strain 2 relative to the reference genome build are compared, and a new Ref/SNP\n\
  \      annotation is constructed whereby the new Ref/SNP information will be Strain/Strain2\
  \ (and no longer the standard\n      reference genome strain Black6 (C57BL/6J))\n\
  \   6) The full genome sequence given with --strain <name> is read into memory,\
  \ and the high-confidence SNP positions between\n      Strain and Strain2 are incorporated\
  \ as full sequence and optionally as N-masking\n\nThe resulting .fa files are ready\
  \ to be indexed with your favourite aligner. Proved and tested aligners include\
  \ Bowtie2,\nTophat, STAR, Hisat2, HiCUP and Bismark. Please note that STAR and Hisat2\
  \ may require you to disable soft-clipping, please\nrefer to the SNPsplit manual\
  \ for more details\n\nBoth the SNP filtering as well as the genome preparation write\
  \ out little report files for record keeping.\nPlease note that the SNPsplit genome\
  \ preparation writes out files and creates new folders for the SNPs and new genomes\
  \ into\nthe current working directory, so move there before invoking SNPsplit_genome_preparation.\n\
  \n\n  USAGE:    SNPsplit_genome_preparation  [options] --vcf_file <file> --reference_genome\
  \ /path/to/genome/ --strain <strain_name>\n\n\n--vcf_file <file>             Mandatory\
  \ file specifying SNP information for mouse strains from the Mouse Genomes Project\n\
  \                              (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/data/mouse-genomes-project).\
  \ The file used and approved is \n                              called 'mgp.v5.merged.snps_all.dbSNP142.vcf.gz'.\
  \ Please note that future versions\n                              of this file or\
  \ entirely different VCF files might not work out-of-the-box but may require some\n\
  \                              tweaking. SNP calls are read from the VCF files,\
  \ and high confidence SNPs are written into\n                              a folder\
  \ in the current working directory called SNPs_<strain_name>/chr<chromosome>.txt,\n\
  \                              in the following format:\n\n                    \
  \                      SNP-ID     Chromosome  Position    Strand   Ref/SNP\n   \
  \                           example:   33941939        9       68878541       1\
  \       T/G\n\n\n--strain <strain_name>        The strain you would like to use\
  \ as SNP (ALT) genome. Mandatory. For an overview of strain names\n            \
  \                  just run SNPsplit_genome_preparation selecting '--list_strains'.\n\
  \n--list_strains                Displays a list of strain names present in the VCF\
  \ file for use with '--strain <strain_name>'.\n\n--dual_hybrid                 Optional.\
  \ The resulting genome will no longer relate to the original reference specified\
  \ with '--reference_genome'.\n                              Instead the new Reference\
  \ (Ref) is defined by '--strain <strain_name>' and the new SNP genome\n        \
  \                      is defined by '--strain2 <strain_name>'. '--dual_hybrid'\
  \ automatically sets '--full_sequence'.\n\n                              This will\
  \ invoke a multi-step process:\n                                 1) Read/filter\
  \ SNPs for first strain (specified with '--strain <strain_name>')\n            \
  \                     2) Write full SNP incorporated (and optionally N-masked) genome\
  \ sequence for first strain\n                                 3) Read/filter SNPs\
  \ for second strain (specified with '--strain2 <strain_name>')\n               \
  \                  4) Write full SNP incorporated (and optionally N-masked) genome\
  \ sequence for second strain\n                                 5) Generate new Ref/Alt\
  \ SNP annotations for Strain1/Strain2\n                                 6) Set first\
  \ strain as new reference genome and construct full SNP incorporated (and optionally\
  \ \n                                    N-masked) genome sequences for Strain1/Strain2\n\
  \                                                            \n\n--strain2 <strain_name>\
  \       Optional for constructing dual hybrid genomes (see '--dual_hybrid' for more\
  \ information). For an\n                              overview of strain names just\
  \ run SNPsplit_genome_preparation selecting '--list_strains'.\n\n--reference_genome\
  \            The path to the reference genome, typically the strain 'Black6' (C57BL/6J),\
  \ e.g.\n                              '--reference_genome /bi/scratch/Genomes/Mouse/GRCm38/'.\
  \ Expects one or more FastA files in this folder\n                             \
  \ (file extension: .fa or .fasta).\n\n--skip_filtering              This option\
  \ skips reading and filtering the VCF file. This assumes that a folder named\n \
  \                             'SNPs_<Strain_Name>' exists in the working directory,\
  \ and that text files with SNP information\n                              are contained\
  \ therein in the following format:\n\n                                         \
  \ SNP-ID     Chromosome  Position    Strand   Ref/SNP\n                        \
  \      example:   33941939        9       68878541       1       T/G\n\n--nmasking\
  \                    Write out a genome version for the strain specified where Ref\
  \ bases are replaced with 'N'. In the\n                              Ref/SNP example\
  \ T/G the N-masked genome would now carry an N instead of the T. The N-masked genome\n\
  \                              is written to a folder called  '<strain_name>_N-masked/'.\
  \ Default: ON.\n\n--full_sequence               Write out a genome version for the\
  \ strain specified where Ref bases are replaced with the SNP base.\n           \
  \                   In the Ref/SNP example T/G the full sequence genome would now\
  \ carry a G instead of the T. The full\n                              sequence genome\
  \ is written out to folder called '<strain_name>_full_sequence/'. May be set in\n\
  \                              addition to '--nmasking'. Default: OFF. \n\n--no_nmasking\
  \                 Disable N-masking if it is not desirable. Will automatically set\
  \ '--full_sequence' instead.\n\n--genome_build [name]         Name of the mouse\
  \ genome build, e.g. GRCm38. Will be incorporated into some of the output files.\n\
  \                              Defaults to 'GRCm38'.\n\n--help                 \
  \       Displays this help information and exits.\n\n--version                 \
  \    Displays version information and exits.\n\n\n                             \
