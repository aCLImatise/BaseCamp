  description: "/--weird  Reads or read pairs that were classified as 'Conflicting'\
    \ (XX:Z:CF) will be written to an extra file (ending in .conflicting.bam) instead\
    \ of being simply skipped. Reads may be classified as 'Conflicting' if a single\
    \ read contains SNP information for both genomes at the same time, or if the SNP\
    \ position was deleted from the read. Read-pairs are considered 'Conflicting'\
    \ if either read is was tagged with the XX:Z:CF flag. Default: OFF."

  description: The output will be written out in SAM format instead of BAM (default).
    SNPsplit will attempt to use the path to Samtools that was specified with --samtools_path,
    or, if it hasn't been specified, attempt to find Samtools in the PATH environment.
    If no installation of Samtools can be found, the SAM output will be compressed
    with GZIP instead (yielding a .sam.gz output file).
