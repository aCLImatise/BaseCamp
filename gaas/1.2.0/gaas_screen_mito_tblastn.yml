  \  \n\nName:\n    screen_mito_tblastn.pl\n\nDescription:\n    Based on a default\
  \ blast tabulated output ( -outfmt 6 => qseqid sseqid\n    pident length mismatch\
  \ gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore)\n    the script aims to tell\
  \ you for each sequence of your assembly, how many\n    non-overlaping mito hits\
  \ have been found, the number of mito genes that\n    have a hit and the total size\
  \ in bp of those hits (overlaping part\n    counted only once). When the assembly\
  \ is provided, 2 new columns are\n    displayed, the sie of the Sequence and the\
  \ % part covered by mito hits.\n    The script aims to help determining the contigs\
  \ from an assembly which\n    are mitochondrial. An assembly graph could be helpful\
  \ to check if the\n    suspicious (those that might be mitochondrial) contigs sounds\
  \ to be\n    circular as expected for a mitochondrial genome.\n\nUsage:\n      \
