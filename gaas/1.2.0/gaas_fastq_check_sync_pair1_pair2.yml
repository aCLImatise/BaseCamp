help_text: "Name:\n    gaas_fastq_check_sync_pair1_pair2.pl\n\nDescription:\n    The\
  \ aim of this script is to check that paired reads from 2 fastq files\n    are still\
  \ synchronized. Read1 and the read2, that come from a paired\n    sequencing, are\
  \ in the same position in the two fastq files. But the\n    order of read in R1/R2\
  \ files can get out of sync if you e.g scan/trim\n    the two files independently.\
  \ So it is a good thing always to check.\n\nUsage:\n        gaas_fastq_check_sync_pair1_pair2.pl\
  \ -i input_R1.fastq -i input_R2.fastq\n        gaas_fastq_check_sync_pair1_pair2.pl\
