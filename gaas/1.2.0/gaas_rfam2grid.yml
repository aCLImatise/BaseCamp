  \   \n\nName:\n    gaas_rfam2grid.pl\n\nDescription:\n    Chunk input data to run\
  \ multiple rfam jobs in parallel We currently run\n    infernal (cmsearch) searches\
  \ directly on the contigs – rather than using\n    the Rfam pipeline with it’s two-step\
  \ search approach (blast to limit\n    candidates, infernal to refine and verify).\
  \ Infernal (\"INFERence of RNA\n    ALignment\") is for searching DNA sequence databases\
  \ for RNA structure\n    and sequence similarities. It is an implementation of a\
  \ special case of\n    profile stochastic context-free grammars called covariance\
  \ models (CMs).\n    A CM is like a sequence profile, but it scores a combination\
  \ of sequence\n    consensus and RNA secondary structure consensus, so in many cases,\
  \ it is\n    more capable of identifying RNA homologs that conserve their secondary\n\
  \    structure more than their primary sequence.\n\nUsage:\n        gaas_rfam2grid.pl\
  \ -f genome.fasta -o outdir\n        gaas_rfam2grid.pl --help\n\nOptions:\n    --fasta\

  \ the covariance models (cm) used by rfam\n\n    --grid  Define which grid to use,\
