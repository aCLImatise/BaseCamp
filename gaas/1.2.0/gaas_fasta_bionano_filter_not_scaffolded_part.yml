  \  \n\nName:\n    gaas_fasta_bionano_filter_not_scaffolded_part.pl\n\nDescription:\n\
  \    This script aims to filter the NOT_SCAFFOLDED.fasta file from bionano\n   \
  \ output in order to remove redundant part from secondary assembly. Indeed\n   \
  \ the NOT_SCAFFOLDED.fasta file is a mixup of the primary and the\n    secondary\
  \ assembly.\n\n    Is not included in the output: - piece of the secondary assembly\
  \ (they\n    are cut in pieces when a piece is used into a scaffold), when the\n\
  \    corresponding sequence from the primary assembly is already used. -\n    contig\
  \ of the secondary assembly - contig of the primary assembly if the\n    counterpart\
  \ of the secondary assembly is already used into a scaffold.\n\nUsage:\n       \
