  \                  \n                  Perform a binary graph cut using Boykov's\
  \ max-flow/min-cut algorithm.\n                  \n                  This implementation\
  \ does only compute a boundary term and does not use\n                  any regional\
  \ term. The desired boundary term can be selected via the\n                  --boundary\
  \ argument. Depending on the selected term, an additional\n                  image\
  \ has to be supplied as badditional.\n                  \n                  In the\
  \ case of the stawiaski boundary term, this is the gradient image.\n           \
  \       In the case of the difference of means, it is the original image.\n    \
  \              \n                  Furthermore the algorithm requires the region\
  \ map of the original\n                  image, a binary image with foreground markers\
  \ and a binary\n                  image with background markers.\n             \
  \     \n                  Additionally a filename for the created binary mask marking\
  \ foreground\n                  and background has to be supplied.\n           \
  \       \n                  Note that the input images must be of the same dimensionality,\n\
  \                  otherwise an exception is thrown.\n                  Note to\
  \ take into account the input images orientation.\n                  Note that the\
  \ quality of the resulting segmentations depends also on\n                  the\
  \ quality of the supplied markers.\n                  \n                  Copyright\
