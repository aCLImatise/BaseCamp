  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --reference_group
- id: reference_rank
  doc: Provide the taxonomic rank of the provided reference group(s). E.g. in case
    of 'Mammalia', provide 'class' for this flag, in case of 'Rodentia,Chiroptera'
    provide 'order,order'. Has to be at least 'Family' or above. This flag is not
    needed if species list is provided as reference_group or if reference group is
    already pre-compiled.
  type: string
  inputBinding:
    prefix: --reference_rank
- id: target_species_list
  doc: File containing the list of species that you want to simulate future extinctions
    for. In case you have generation length (GL) data available, provide the file
    containing the GL data for each species here (including the species names). This
    function will output one central data file for downstream processing that contains
    the current status information as well as the GL data (if available) for each
    species. You can provide multiple GL values for each species, e.g. several randomely
    sampled values from the GL uncertainty interval of a given species. Set this flag
    to 0 if you want to supress downloading of current status information, e.g. if
    you already have current status information for your species (may be necessary
    if you don't have a valid IUCN key). Set to 1 if you want to use the same taxa
    that are present in the reference group. See https://github.com/tobiashofmann8
    8/iucn_extinction_simulator/data/precompiled/ for examples of the format of GL
    data input files and the format of the output file conataining current status
    information.

- id: iucn_key
  doc: Provide your IUCN API key (see https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/api/v3/token)
    for downloading IUCN history of your provided reference group. Not required if
    using precompiled reference group and a manually compiled current status list
    (to be used in the 'transition_rates' function). Also not required if all species
    in your target_species_list are present in the precompiled reference_group).

  doc: Turn off the online-search for precompiled IUCN history files for your reference
