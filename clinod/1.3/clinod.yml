  description: "- optional, an absolute path to the Batchman \r executable. By default\
    \ this path is searched in \r the environmental variable called BATCHMAN_PATH.\
    \ \r If it is not found there, then clinod attempts \r to locate the batchman\
    \ executable in the same \r directory as the clinod jar file. In order to be \r\
    \ found there the batchman executable must be \r called the \"batchman.exe\" on\
    \ Windows systems and \r the \"batchman\" on all other operating systems.\r If\
    \ neither of those paths are valid then the \r execution fails.  \r If several\
    \ paths are valid then clinod uses them\r in the following order:  \r 1) Path\
    \ from the command line parameter\r 2) Path from the environmental variable\r\
    \ 3) Local directory path \r"
