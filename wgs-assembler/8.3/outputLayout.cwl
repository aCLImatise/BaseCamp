- id: in_maximum_uncorrected_gap
  doc: 'The maximum uncorrected PacBio gap that will be allowed. When there is no
    short-read coverage for a region, by default the pipeline will split a PacBio
    sequence. This option allows a number of PacBio sequences without short-read coverage
    to remain. For example, specifying 50, will mean 50bp can have no short-read coverage
    without splitting the PacBio sequence. Warning: this will allow more sequences
    that went through the SMRTportal to not be fixed.'

    be a repeat and distribute reads to their best locations (this is only useful
    for metagenomic or non-even coverage datasets. Otherwise the global repeat estimate
    is used instead)
