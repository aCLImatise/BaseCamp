  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Reads will contain fraction insertion error 'e' (0.01 == 1% error).

  synonyms:
  - -ed
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: err
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Allow pairs to span N regions in the reference.  By default, pairs
    are not allowed to span a gap.  Reads are never allowed to cover N's.
  synonyms:
  - -allowgaps
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Allow reads to contain N regions.  Implies -allowgaps
  synonyms:
  - -allowns

- !Flag
  description: For -mp, do not create chimeric junction reads.  Create only fully
    PE or fully MP reads.
  synonyms:
  - -nojunction
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Output a normal-oriented (both forward or both reverse) pair with probability
    p.  Only for -pe and -mp.
  synonyms:
  - -normal
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: p
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: Create single-end reads.
  synonyms:
  - -se
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: junkStdDev false Create chimeric single-end reads.  The chimer is formed
    from two uniformly distributed positions in the reference.  Some amount of random
    junk is inserted at the junction.  With probability 'false' the read is not chimeric,
    but still the junk bases inserted in the middle.
  synonyms:
  - -cc
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: junkSize
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: shearStdDev Create paired-end reads, from fragments of size 'shearSize
    +- shearStdDev'.
  synonyms:
  - -pe
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: shearSize
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: "insertStdDev shearSize shearStdDev enrichment Create mate-pair reads.\
    \  The pairs will be 'insertSize +- insertStdDev' apart.  The circularized insert\
    \ is then sheared into fragments of size 'shearSize +- shearStdDev'.  With probability\
    \ 'enrichment' the fragment containing the junction is used to form the pair of\
    \ reads.  The junction location is uniformly distributed through this fragment.\
    \ Reads are labeled as: tMP - a MP pair fMP - a PE pair aMP - a MP pair with junction\
    \ in the first read bMP - a MP pair with junction in the second read cMP - a MP\
    \ pair with junction in both reads (the reads overlap)"
