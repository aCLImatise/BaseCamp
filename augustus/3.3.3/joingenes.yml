  description: structure is "better" than another one, if it has the transcript with
    the highest "score", which is not present in the other gene structure
  synonyms:
  - '- a'
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: gene
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: ',file2,...      -g file1,file2,...      where "file1,file2,...,filen"
    have to be data files with genesets in GTF format.'
  synonyms:
  - --genesets
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: file1
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -o ofile                where "ofile" is the name for an output file
    (GTF).
  synonyms:
  - --output
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: ofile
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: ',pr2,...        -p pr1,pr2,...          where "pr1,pr2,...,prn" have
    to be positiv integers (different from 0).'
  synonyms:
  - --priorities
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: pr1
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -f file         where "file" is the path of a file containing paths
    to GTF files and corresponding priorities in a tab-separated list (2 columns).
    Use this option instead of -g and -p Have to be as many as filenames are added.
    Bigger numbers means a higher priority. If no priorities are added, the program
    will set all priorties to 1. This option is only useful, if there is more than
    one geneset. If there is a conflict between two transcripts, so that they can
    not be picked in the same genestructure, joingenes decides for the one with the
    highest priority.
  synonyms:
  - --inputfile
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: file
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -e x                    where "x" is a non-negative integer If a prediction
    is <=x bases next to a prediction range border, the program supposes, that there
    could be a mistake. Default is 1000. To disable the function, set errordistance
    to a negative number (e.g. -1).
  synonyms:
  - --errordistance
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: x
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -m x                    where "x" is a genemodel from the set {eukaryote,
    bacterium}. Default is eukaryotic.
  synonyms:
  - --genemodel
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: x
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -a                      is a flag If this flag is set, the program
    joines different genes, if the transcripts of the genes are alternative variants.
  synonyms:
  - --alternatives
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: ',pr2,..           -s pr1,pr2,...          where "pr1,pr2,...,prm"
    have to be positiv integers (different from 0). Default is none. if the core of
    a joined/non-joined transcript has one of these priorities it will not occur in
    the output file.'
  synonyms:
  - --suppress
  args: !SimpleFlagArg
    name: pr1
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -i                      is a flag If this flag is set, the program
    joines the stop_codons to the CDS.
  synonyms:
  - --stopincoding
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -j                      is a flag (to disable joining). If this flag
    is set, the program will not join/merge/shuffle; it will only decide between the
    unchanged input transcipts and output them.
  synonyms:
  - --nojoin
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -l                      is a flag (to disable selection). If this flag
    is set, the program will NOT select at the end between "contradictory" transcripts.
    "contradictory" is self defined with respect to known biological terms. The selection
    works with a self defined scoring function.
  synonyms:
  - --noselection
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
- !Flag
  description: -c                      is a flag. If this flag is set, it disables
    the normal function of the program and activates a compare and separate mode to
    separate equal transcripts from non equal ones.
  synonyms:
  - --onlycompare
  args: !EmptyFlagArg {}
  optional: true
