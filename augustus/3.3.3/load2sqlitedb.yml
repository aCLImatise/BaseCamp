  \ fastafile\n\nfastafile refers to a genome file in FASTA format or a hints file\
  \ in GFF format\nSPECIES is the same identifier as is used in the treefile and alnfile\
  \ parameters to augustus.\n\ndatabase.db is the name of the database that will be\
  \ opened or created if it does not exist already.\nWhen storing genomes/hints of\
  \ multiple organisms call this program repeatedly for each one.\nA single table\
  \ with the structure is created.\n\nparameters:\n--help        print this usage\
  \ info\n--chunksize   this option is only relevant when loading a sequence file\n\
  \              the sequences in the input genome are split into chunks of this size\
  \ so\n              that subsequent retrievals of small sequence ranges do not require\
  \ to read\n              the complete - potentially much longer - chromosome. (<=\
  \ 1000000, default 50000)\n--noIdx       use this flag to suppress the building\
  \ of indices on the database tables.\n              If you are going to load several\
  \ genomes and/or hint files in a row, this option\n              is recommended\
  \ to speed up the loading. But make sure to build indices with\n              --makeIdx\
  \ after all genomes/hints are loaded. Otherwise, data retrieval operations\n   \
  \           can be very slow.\n--makeIdx     use this flag to build the indices\
  \ on the database tables after loading several\n              genomes and/or hint\
  \ files with --noIdx. Only call this once for all species, e.g.\n              load2sqlitedb\
  \ --makeIdx --dbaccess=database.db\n--clean       makes a clean load deleting existing\
  \ hints/genome for the species from the database.\n              When called with\
  \ a gff file, only the hints for the species are delete, but not the genome.\n \
  \             When called with a fasta file, both hints and genome for the species\
  \ are deleted.\n\nexamples:\n     load2sqlitedb --species=chicken --dbaccess=chicken.db\
  \ chickengenome.fa\n     load2sqlitedb --species=chicken --dbaccess=chicken.db chickenhints.gff\n"
