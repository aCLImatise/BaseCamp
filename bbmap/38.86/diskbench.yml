help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified March 5, 2018\n\nDescription:\
  \  Benchmarks a disk with multithreaded I/O.\n\nUsage:  diskbench.sh path=<path>\
  \ data=<8g> passes=<2> threads=<>\n\nParameters:\npath=           Location to read\
  \ and write.\ndata=8g         Number of bytes to process per pass.\nthreads=   \
  \     Number of threads to use.  By default, all logical threads.\n            \
  \    In RW mode the number of active threads is doubled.\nmode=rw         I/O mode:\n\
  \                   r:  Test read speed only.\n                   w:  Test write\
  \ speed only.\n                   rw: Test read and write speed simultaneously.\n\
  \nProcessing parameters:\nNone yet!\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will\
  \ set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will\
  \ specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n                specify 200 megs. The\
  \ max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause\
  \ the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires\
  \ Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell\
