help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified June 26, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  RQCFilter2 is a revised version of RQCFilter that uses a common path for all\
  \ dependencies.\nThe dependencies are available at http://portal.nersc.gov/dna/microbial/assembly/bushnell/RQCFilterData.tar\n\
  \nPerforms quality-trimming, artifact removal, linker-trimming, adapter trimming,\
  \ and spike-in removal using BBDuk.\nPerforms human/cat/dog/mouse/microbe removal\
  \ using BBMap.\nIt requires 40 GB RAM for mousecatdoghuman, but only 1GB or so without\
  \ them.\n\nUsage:  rqcfilter2.sh in=<input file> path=<output directory> rqcfilterdata=<path\
  \ to RQCFilterData directory>\n\nPrimary I/O parameters:\nin=<file>           Input\
  \ reads.\nin2=<file>          Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.\n\
  path=null           Set to the directory to use for all output files.\n\nReference\
  \ file paths:\nrqcfilterdata=      Path to unzipped RQCFilterData directory.  Default\
  \ is /global/projectb/sandbox/gaag/bbtools/RQCFilterData\nref=<file,file>     Comma-delimited\
  \ list of additional reference files for filtering via BBDuk.\n\nOutput parameters:\n\
  scafstats=scaffoldStats.txt  Scaffold stats file name (how many reads matched which\
  \ reference scaffold) .\nkmerstats=kmerStats.txt      Kmer stats file name (duk-like\
  \ output).\nlog=status.log               Progress log file name.\nfilelist=file-list.txt\
  \       List of output files.\nstats=filterStats.txt        Overall stats file name.\n\
  stats2=filterStats2.txt      Better overall stats file name.\nihist=ihist_merge.txt\
  \        Insert size histogram name.  Set to null to skip merging.\noutribo=ribo.fq.gz\
  \           Output for ribosomal reads, if removeribo=t.\nreproduceName=reproduce.sh\
  \   Name of shellscript to reproduce these results.\nusetmpdir=t               \
  \   Write temp files to TMPDIR.\ntmpdir=                      Override TMPDIR.\n\
  \nAdapter trimming parameters:\ntrimhdist=1         Hamming distance used for trimming.\n\
  trimhdist2=         Hamming distance used for trimming with short kmers.  If unset,\
  \ trimhdist will be used.\ntrimk=23            Kmer length for trimming stage.\n\
  mink=11             Minimum kmer length for short kmers when trimming.\ntrimfragadapter=t\
  \   Trim all known Illumina adapter sequences, including TruSeq and Nextera.\ntrimrnaadapter=f\
  \    Trim Illumina TruSeq-RNA adapters.\nbisulfite=f         Currently, this trims\
  \ the last 1bp from all reads after the adapter-trimming phase.\nfindadapters=t\

  \ and use that rather than a set of known adapters.\nswift=f             Trim Swift\
  \ sequences: Trailing C/T/N R1, leading G/A/N R2.\n\nQuality trimming parameters:\n\
  qtrim=f             Trim read ends to remove bases with quality below minq.  Performed\
  \ AFTER looking for kmers.\n                    Values: rl (trim both ends), f (neither\
  \ end), r (right end only), l (left end only).\ntrimq=10            Trim quality\
  \ threshold.  Must also set qtrim for direction.\nminlength=45        (ml) Reads\
  \ shorter than this after trimming will be discarded.  Pairs will be discarded only\
  \ if both are shorter.\nmlf=0.333           (minlengthfraction) Reads shorter than\
  \ this fraction of original length after trimming will be discarded.\nminavgquality=5\
  \     (maq) Reads with average quality (before trimming) below this will be discarded.\n\
