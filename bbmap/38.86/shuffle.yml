help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified November 9, 2016\n\nDescription:\
  \  Reorders reads randomly, keeping pairs together.\n\nUsage:  shuffle.sh in=<file>\
  \ out=<file>\n\nStandard parameters:\nin=<file>       The 'in=' flag is needed if\
  \ the input file is not the first parameter.  'in=stdin' will pipe from standard\
  \ in.\nin2=<file>      Use this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.\n\
  out=<file>      The 'out=' flag is needed if the output file is not the second parameter.\
  \  'out=stdout' will pipe to standard out.\nout2=<file>     Use this to write 2nd\
  \ read of pairs to a different file.\noverwrite=t     (ow) Set to false to force\
  \ the program to abort rather than overwrite an existing file.\nziplevel=2     \
  \ (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change compression level; lower compression\
  \ is faster.\nint=auto        (interleaved) Set to t or f to override interleaving\
  \ autodetection.\n\nProcessing parameters:\nshuffle         Randomly reorders reads\
  \ (default).\nname            Sort reads by name.\ncoordinate      Sort reads by\
  \ mapping location.\nsequence        Sort reads by sequence.\n\n\nJava Parameters:\n\
  -Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n \
  \               -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200\
  \ megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom\
  \           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n     \
  \           exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
