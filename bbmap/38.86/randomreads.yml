help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 1, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Generates random synthetic reads from a reference genome.  Read names indicate\
  \ their genomic origin.\nAllows precise customization of things like insert size\
  \ and synthetic mutation type, sizes, and rates.\nRead names generated by this program\
  \ are used by MakeRocCure (samtoroc.sh) and GradeSamFile (gradesam.sh).\nThey can\
  \ also be used by BBMap (bbmap.sh) and BBMerge (bbmerge.sh) to automatically calculate\n\
  true and false positive rates, if the flag 'parsecustom' is used.\n\nUsage:   randomreads.sh\
  \ ref=<file> out=<file> length=<number> reads=<number>\n\nBasic parameters:\nout=null\
  \        Output file.  If reads are paired and a single file name is\n         \
  \       given, output will be interleaved.  For paired reads in twin\n         \
  \       files, set out1= and out2= \nref=null        Reference file.  Not needed\
  \ if the reference is already indexed.\nbuild=1         If multiple references are\
  \ indexed in the same directory,\n                each needs a unique build ID.\n\
  midpad=300      Specifies space between scaffolds in packed index.\nreads=0    \
  \     Generate this many reads (or pairs).\ncoverage=-1     If positive, generate\
  \ enough reads to hit this coverage\n                target, based on the genome\
  \ size.\noverwrite=t     Set to false to disallow overwriting of existing files.\n\
  replacenoref=f  Set to true to replace Ns in the reference sequence \n         \
  \       with random letters.\nsimplenames=f   Set to true to generate read names\
  \ that clearly indicate\n                genomic origin, without BBMap internal\
  \ coordinates.\nilluminanames=f Set to true to have matching names for paired reads,\
  \ \n                rather than naming by location.\nrenamebyinsert=f    Insert\
  \ the insert size into the name.\naddpairnum=f    Set true to add ' 1:' and ' 2:'\
  \ to the end of read names.\naddslash=f      Set true to add '/1' and '/2' to the\
  \ end of read names.\nspaceslash=f    Set true to add a space before slash read\
  \ pairnum.\nprefix=null     Generated reads will start with this prefix, \n    \
  \            rather than naming by location.\nseed=0          Use this to set the\
  \ random number generator seed; \n                use -1 for a random seed.\n\n\
  Length Parameters - normally only minlength and maxlength are needed.\nminlength=150\
  \   Generate reads of up to this length.\nmaxlength=150   Generate reads of at least\
  \ this length.\ngaussianlength=f  Use a gaussian length distribution (for PacBio).\n\
  \                  Otherwise, the distribution is linear.\nmidlength=-1    Gaussian\
  \ curve peaks at this point.  Must be between\n                minlength and maxlength,\
  \ in Gaussian mode.\nreadlengthsd=-1 Standard deviation of the Gaussian curve. \
  \ Note that the\n                final curve is a sum of multiple curves, but this\
  \ will affect\n                overall curve width.  By default this is set to 1/4\
  \ of range.\n\nPairing parameters:\npaired=f        Set to true for paired reads.\n\
  mininsert=      Controls minimum insert length.  Default depends on read length.\n\
  maxinsert=      Controls maximum insert length.  Default depends on read length.\n\
  triangle=f      Make a triangular insert size distribution.\nflat=f          Make\
  \ a roughly flat insert size distribution..\nsuperflat=f     Make a perfectly flat\
  \ insert size distribution.\ngaussian=t      Make a bell-shaped insert size distribution,\
  \ with \n                standard deviation of (maxinsert-mininsert)/6.\nsamestrand=f\
  \    Generate paired reads on the same strand.\n\nMutation parameters:\nsnprate=0\
  \       Add snps to reads with this probability (0-1).\ninsrate=0       Add insertions\
  \ to reads with this probability (0-1).\ndelrate=0       Add deletions to reads\
  \ with this probability (0-1).\nsubrate=0       Add contiguous substitutions to\
  \ reads with this probability (0-1).\nnrate=0         Add nocalls to reads with\
  \ this probability (0-1).\n\nNote: With a 'rate' of X, each read has an X chance\
  \ of getting at least \n1 mutation, X^2 chance of 2+ mutations, X^3 chance of 3+\
  \ mutations, \nand so forth up to the maximum allowed number of mutations of that\
  \ type.\n\nmaxsnps=3       Add at most this many snps per read.\nmaxinss=2     \
  \  Add at most this many deletions per read.\nmaxdels=2       Add at most this many\
  \ insertions per read.\nmaxsubs=2       Add at most this many contiguous substitutions\
  \ per read.\nmaxns=0         Add at most this many blocks of Ns per read.\n\nmaxinslen=12\
  \    Max length of insertions.\nmaxdellen=400   Max length of deletions.\nmaxsublen=12\
  \    Max length of contiguous substitutions.\nmaxnlen=1       Min length of N blocks.\n\
  \nmininslen=1     Min length of insertions.\nmindellen=1     Min length of deletions.\n\
  minsublen=2     Min length of contiguous substitutions.\nminnlen=1       Min length\
  \ of N blocks.\n\nIllumina quality parameters:\nmaxq=36         Upper bound of quality\
  \ values.\nmidq=28         Approximate average of quality values.\nminq=20     \
  \    Lower bound of quality values.\nq=              Sets maxq, midq, and minq to\
  \ the same value.\nadderrors=t     Add substitution errors based on quality values,\
  \ \n                after mutations.\nqv=4            Vary the base quality of reads\
  \ by up to this much\n                to simulate tile effects.\n\nPacBio quality\
  \ parameters:\npacbio=f        Use a PacBio error model, rather than Illumina \n\
  \                error model, and add PacBio errors after mutations.\npbmin=0.13\
  \      Minimum rate of PacBio errors for a read.\npbmax=0.17      Maximum rate of\
  \ PacBio errors for a read.\n\nOther Parameters:\noverlap=1       Require reads\
  \ to overlap scaffold end by at least this much.\nbanns=f         Do not generate\
  \ reads over reference Ns.\nmetagenome=f    Assign scaffolds a random exponential\
  \ coverage level,\n                to simulate a metagenomic or RNA coverage distribution.\n\
  randomscaffold=f    Choose random scaffolds without respect to length.\namp=1  \
  \         Simulate highly-amplified MDA single-cell data by \n                setting\
  \ this to a higher number like 1000.\nreplacenoref=f  Replace intra- and inter-scaffold\
  \ Ns with random bases.\npbadapter=      Add adapter sequence to some reads using\
  \ this literal string.\nfragadapter=    Add this sequence to paired reads with insert\
  \ size \n                shorter than read length.\nfragadapter2=   Use this sequence\
  \ for read 2.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's memory usage,\
  \ overriding the \n                program's automatic memory detection.\n     \
  \           -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify \n\t\t\
  200 megs.\n                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom\
  \           This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n     \
  \           exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
