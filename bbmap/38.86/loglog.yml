help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified March 24, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Estimates cardinality of unique kmers in sequence data.\nSee also kmercountmulti.sh.\n\
  \nUsage:  loglog.sh in=<file> k=<31>\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>       (in1) Input\
  \ file, or comma-delimited list of files.\nin2=<file>      ptional second file for\
  \ paired reads.\nk=31            Use this kmer length for counting.\nbuckets=2048\
  \    Use this many buckets for counting; higher decreases\n                variance,\
  \ for large datasets.  Must be a power of 2.\nseed=-1         Use this seed for\
  \ hash functions.  A negative number forces\n                a random seed.\nminprob=0\
  \       Set to a value between 0 and 1 to exclude kmers with a lower \n        \
  \        probability of being correct.\n\n\nShortcuts:\nThe # symbol will be substituted\
  \ for 1 and 2.\nFor example:\nloglog.sh in=read#.fq\n...is equivalent to:\nloglog.sh\
  \ in1=read1.fq in2=read2.fq\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx            This will set Java's\
  \ memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n                -Xmx20g will specify\
  \ 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n                    The max\
  \ is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom           This flag will cause the\
  \ process to exit if an out-of-memory\n                exception occurs.  Requires\
  \ Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\nSupported input formats are\
  \ fastq, fasta, scarf, sam, and bam.\nSupported compression formats are gzip and\
  \ bz2.\nTo read from stdin, set 'in=stdin'.  The format should be specified with\
  \ an extension, like 'in=stdin.fq.gz'\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
