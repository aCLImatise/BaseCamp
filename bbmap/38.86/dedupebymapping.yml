help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 4, 2020\n\nDescription:\
  \  Deduplicates mapped reads based on pair mapping coordinates.\n\nUsage:   dedupebymapping.sh\
  \ in=<file> out=<file>\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>           The 'in=' flag is needed\
  \ if the input file is not the \n                    first parameter.  'in=stdin'\
  \ will pipe from standard in.\nout=<file>          The 'out=' flag is needed if\
  \ the output file is not the \n                    second parameter.  'out=stdout'\
  \ will pipe to standard out.\noverwrite=t         (ow) Set to false to force the\
  \ program to abort rather \n                    than overwrite an existing file.\n\
  ziplevel=2          (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to change \n        \
  \            compression level; lower compression is faster.\nkeepunmapped=t   \
  \   (ku) Keep unmapped reads.  This refers to unmapped\n                    single-ended\
  \ reads or pairs with both unmapped.\nkeepsingletons=t    (ks) Keep all pairs in\
  \ which only one read mapped.  If \n                    false, duplicate singletons\
  \ will be discarded.\nignorepairorder=f   (ipo) If true, consider reverse-complementary\
  \ pairs\n                    as duplicates.\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx          \
  \      This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n          \
  \          -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will specify 200 megs.\n\
  \                    The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom       \
  \        This flag will cause the process to exit if an\n                    out-of-memory\
  \ exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da                 Disable assertions.\n\
