help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified April 25, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Compresses or decompresses files based on extensions.\nThis only exists because\
  \ the syntax and default behavior of many\ncompression utilities is unintuitive;\
  \ it is just a wrapper, and\nrelies on existing executables in the command line\
  \ (pigz, lbzip, etc.)\nDoes not delete the input file.\nDoes not untar files.\n\n\
  Usage:  unzip.sh in=<file> out=<file>\n\nParameters:\nin=<file>       Input file.\n\
  out=<file>      Output file for good reads.\nzl=             Set the compression\
  \ level; 0-9 or 11.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov if you\
  \ encounter any problems.\n\n"
