help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified December 19, 2018\nDescription:\
  \  Generates a length histogram of input reads.\n\nUsage:\treadlength.sh in=<input\
  \ file>\n\nin=<file>    \tThe 'in=' flag is needed only if the input file is not\
  \ the first parameter.  'in=stdin.fq' will pipe from standard in.\nin2=<file>  \
  \ \tUse this if 2nd read of pairs are in a different file.\nout=<file>   \tWrite\
  \ the histogram to this file.  Default is stdout.\nbin=10       \tSet the histogram\
  \ bin size.\nmax=80000    \tSet the max read length to track.\nround=f      \tPlaces\
  \ reads in the closest bin, rather than the highest bin of at least readlength.\n\
  nzo=t        \t(nonzeroonly) Do not print empty bins.\nreads=-1     \tIf nonnegative,\
  \ stop after this many reads.\n\nPlease contact Brian Bushnell at bbushnell@lbl.gov\
  \ if you encounter any problems.\n\n"
