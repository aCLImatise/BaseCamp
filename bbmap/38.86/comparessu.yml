help_text: "\nWritten by Brian Bushnell\nLast modified December 4, 2019\n\nDescription:\
  \  Aligns SSUs to each other and reports identity.\nThis requires sequences annotated\
  \ with a taxID in their header.\n\nUsage:  comparessu.sh in=<input file> out=<output\
  \ file>\n\nInput may be fasta or fastq, compressed or uncompressed.\n\nStandard\
  \ parameters:\nin=<file>       Input sequences.\nout=<file>      Output data.\n\
  t=              Set the number of threads; default is logical processors.\noverwrite=f\
  \     (ow) Set to false to force the program to abort rather than\n            \
  \    overwrite an existing file.\nshowspeed=t     (ss) Set to 'f' to suppress display\
  \ of processing speed.\nziplevel=2      (zl) Set to 1 (lowest) through 9 (max) to\
  \ change compression\n                level; lower compression is faster.\nreads=-1\
  \        If positive, quit after this many sequences.\n\nProcessing parameters:\n\
  ata=f           Do an all-to-all comparison.  Otherwise, each sequence will\n  \
  \              only be compared to one other randomly-selected sequence\n      \
  \          per taxonomic level.\nminlen=0        Ignore sequences shorter than this.\n\
  maxlen=BIG      Ignore sequences longer than this.\nmaxns=-1        If positive,\
  \ ignore sequences with more than this many Ns.\n\n\nJava Parameters:\n-Xmx    \
  \        This will set Java's memory usage, overriding autodetection.\n        \
  \        -Xmx20g will specify 20 gigs of RAM, and -Xmx200m will\n              \
  \  specify 200 megs. The max is typically 85% of physical memory.\n-eoom       \
  \    This flag will cause the process to exit if an out-of-memory\n            \
  \    exception occurs.  Requires Java 8u92+.\n-da             Disable assertions.\n\
