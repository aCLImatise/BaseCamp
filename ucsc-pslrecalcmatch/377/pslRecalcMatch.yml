help_text: "pslRecalcMatch - Recalculate match,mismatch,repMatch columns in psl file.\n\
  This can be useful if the psl went through pslMap, or if you've added \nlower-case\
  \ repeat masking after the fact\nusage:\n   pslRecalcMatch in.psl targetSeq querySeq\
  \ out.psl\nwhere targetSeq is either a nib directory or a two bit file\nand querySeq\
  \ is a fasta file, nib file, two bit file, or list\nof such files.  The psl's should\
  \ be simple non-translated ones.\nThis will work faster if the in.psl is sorted\
  \ on target.\noptions:\n   -ignoreQUniq - ignore everything after the last `-' in\
  \ the qName field, that\n    is sometimes used to generate a unique identifier\n\
  \   -ignoreQMissing - pass through the record if querySeq doesn't include qName\n\
