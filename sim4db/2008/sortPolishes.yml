help_text: "unknown option: --help\nusage: sortPolishes [-c | -g] [-m M] [-t T] [-gff3]\
  \ [-M [file ...]]\n  -c (-C)    Sort by the cDNA index (defline).\n  -g (-G)   \
  \ Sort by the genomic index (defline).\n  -M         Skip the sort, just do a merge.\n\
  \  -m M       Use at most M MB of core, using a disk-based merge if memory\n   \
  \          is exhausted.  Default: 4096.\n  -t T       Use directory 'T' for temporary\
  \ files.  Default is the current\n             working directory.  The sort unlinks\
  \ files immediately after\n             creation: no files will exist, but space\
  \ will be used.\n  -gff3      Format output as GFF3.\n  -v         Be verbose.\n\
  \n  Both sort methods use the OTHER index as a secondary key.\n\nERROR: what key\
  \ do you want to sort on (-c, -g, -C, -G)\n\nERROR: no files to merge\n"
