  \ or 0] -t [train_file_name] (-p [thread_num])\n\n       Mandatory parameters\n\
  \       [seq_file_name]:    sequence file name including the full path\n       [output_file_name]:\
  \ output file name including the full path\n       [1 or 0]:           1 if the\
  \ sequence file has complete genomic sequences\n                           0 if\
  \ the sequence file has short sequence reads\n       [train_file_name]:  file name\
  \ that contains model parameters; this file should be in the \"train\" directory\n\
  \                           Note that four files containing model parameters already\
  \ exist in the \"train\" directory\n                           [complete] for complete\
  \ genomic sequences or short sequence reads without sequencing error\n         \
  \                  [sanger_5] for Sanger sequencing reads with about 0.5% error\
  \ rate\n                           [sanger_10] for Sanger sequencing reads with\
  \ about 1% error rate\n                           [454_5] for 454 pyrosequencing\
  \ reads with about 0.5% error rate\n                           [454_10] for 454\
  \ pyrosequencing reads with about 1% error rate\n                           [454_30]\
  \ for 454 pyrosequencing reads with about 3% error rate\n                      \
  \     [illumina_5] for Illumina sequencing reads with about 0.5% error rate\n  \
  \                         [illumina_10] for Illumina sequencing reads with about\
  \ 1% error rate\n\n       Optional parameter\n       [thread_num]:       the number\
  \ of threads used by FragGeneScan; default is 1 thread.\n"
