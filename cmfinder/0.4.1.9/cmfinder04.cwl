  doc: create tab-delimited <file> containing timing stats on various sub-processes
    of this script.  the first tab-delimited field is the description of the sub-process,
    the second field is the total CPU time (user+sys) and the third field is the wall-clock
    time.  Sub-processes can occur in multiple lines if they are run multiple timers,
    so the caller should add them.  Due to my laziness, the time of the clustalw program
    (if used) is not counted.
