help_text: "Usage: BRS [options] <seq file>\n<seq file>: a one column file only containing\
  \ the positions of short reads.\nOptions:\n-h: print this message.\n-q <float>:\
  \ the quantile used for identification of the singular genomic positions; default\
  \ is 0.95\n-w <int>: the window size for calculating the quantiles; default is 200\n\
  -o <string>: the output bin file; if unspecified, print to the stdout.\n-m <string>:\
  \ the mappability file; If provided, filter by mappability and the output will contain\
  \ uniquely mappable positions with no reads mapped\n-g <string>: the gap file (two\
  \ column data file with 1st column the start positions of the gaps and the 2nd column\
  \ the end positions of the gaps)\n-s <string>: report the summary statistics to\
  \ the file <string>\n--multiplicity <float>: If a genomic position has more than\
  \ multiplicity*quantile number of reads,\n                        it will be viewed\
  \ as an outlier\n                        and the number of reads at this position\
  \ will be set as multiplicity*quantile;\n                        default is 5.0\n"
