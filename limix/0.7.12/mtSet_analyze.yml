  \ PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!\n\nImporting the multiarray\
  \ numpy extension module failed.  Most\nlikely you are trying to import a failed\
  \ build of numpy.\nHere is how to proceed:\n- If you're working with a numpy git\
  \ repository, try `git clean -xdf`\n  (removes all files not under version control)\
  \ and rebuild numpy.\n- If you are simply trying to use the numpy version that you\
  \ have installed:\n  your installation is broken - please reinstall numpy.\n- If\
  \ you have already reinstalled and that did not fix the problem, then:\n  1. Check\
  \ that you are using the Python you expect (you're using /tmp/tmpy7qy2459/bin/python),\n\
  \     and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can\n   \
  \  interfere with the Python and numpy versions you're trying to use.\n  2. If (1)\
  \ looks fine, you can open a new issue at\n     https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.\
  \  Please include details on:\n     - how you installed Python\n     - how you installed\
  \ numpy\n     - your operating system\n     - whether or not you have multiple versions\
  \ of Python installed\n     - if you built from source, your compiler versions and\
  \ ideally a build log\n\n     Note: this error has many possible causes, so please\
  \ don't comment on\n     an existing issue about this - open a new one instead.\n\
  \nOriginal error was: /tmp/tmpy7qy2459/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/../../../.././libgomp.so.1:\
  \ version `GOMP_4.0' not found (required by /tmp/tmpy7qy2459/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/../../../../libcblas.so.3)\n\
