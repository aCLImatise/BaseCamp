    description: <chars>         Specify characters to use as chromosome name terminators
      in the FASTA header line; these characters and anything after are not part of
      the chromosome name.  You must specify all characters on a single -B switch.  So,
      for example, with -B_|, the FASTA header line '>chr1|Chromosome 1' would generate
      a chromosome named 'chr1'.  There's a separate flag for indicating that a space
      is a terminator.

    description: The size of the genome locations stored in the index.  This can be
      from 4 to 8 bytes.  The locations need to be big enough not only to index the
      genome, but also to allow some space for representing seeds that occur multiple
      times.  For the human genome, it will fit with four byte locations if the seed
      size is 19 or larger, but needs 5 (or more) for smaller seeds.  Making the location
      size bigger than necessary will just waste (lots of) space, so unless you're
      doing something quite unusual, the right answer is 4 or 5.  Default is 4

    description: Use a temp file to work better in smaller memory.  This only helps
      a little, but can be the difference if you're close. In particular, this will
      generally use less memory than the index will use once it's built, so if this
      doesn't work you won't be able to use the index anyway. However, if you've got
      sufficient memory to begin with, this option will just slow down the index build
      by doing extra, useless IO.
