inputs:
- id: seed_size_default
  doc: 'Seed size (default: 20)'
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -s
- id: h_gone_nine
  doc: Use pre-computed table bias for hg19, which results in better speed, balance,
    and a smaller index, but only works for the complete human reference.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -hg19
- id: of_actor
  doc: This parameter is deprecated and will be ignored.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -Ofactor
- id: tmax_threads
  doc: Specify the maximum number of threads to use. Default is the number of cores.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -tMaxThreads
- id: chars_specify_characters
  doc: <chars>         Specify characters to use as chromosome name terminators in
    the FASTA header line; these characters and anything after are not part of the
    chromosome name.  You must specify all characters on a single -B switch.  So,
    for example, with -B_|, the FASTA header line '>chr1|Chromosome 1' would generate
    a chromosome named 'chr1'.  There's a separate flag for indicating that a space
    is a terminator.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -B
- id: b_space
  doc: Indicates that the space character is a terminator for chromosome names (see
    -B above).  This may be used in addition to other terminators specified by -B.  -B
    and -bSpace are case sensitive.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -bSpace
- id: pp_adding
  doc: Specify the number of Ns to put as padding between chromosomes.  This must
    be as large as the largest edit distance you'll ever use, and there's a performance
    advantage to have it be bigger than any read you'll process.  Default is 500
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -pPadding
- id: h_histogram_file
  doc: Build a histogram of seed popularity.  This is just for information, it's not
    used by SNAP.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -HHistogramFile
- id: exact
  doc: Compute hash table sizes exactly.  This will slow down index build, but usually
    will result in smaller indices.
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -exact
- id: key_size
  doc: "The number of bytes to use for the hash table key.  Larger values increase\
    \ SNAP's memory footprint, but allow larger seeds.  Default: 4"
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -keysize
- id: large
  doc: Build a larger index that's a little faster, particualrly for runs with quick/inaccurate
    parameters.  Increases index size by about 30%, depending on the other index parameters
    and the contents of the reference genome
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -large
- id: location_size
  doc: The size of the genome locations stored in the index.  This can be from 4 to
    8 bytes.  The locations need to be big enough not only to index the genome, but
    also to allow some space for representing seeds that occur multiple times.  For
    the human genome, it will fit with four byte locations if the seed size is 19
    or larger, but needs 5 (or more) for smaller seeds.  Making the location size
    bigger than necessary will just waste (lots of) space, so unless you're doing
    something quite unusual, the right answer is 4 or 5.  Default is 4
  type: boolean
  inputBinding:
    prefix: -locationSize
- id: sm
  doc: Use a temp file to work better in smaller memory.  This only helps a little,
    but can be the difference if you're close. In particular, this will generally
    use less memory than the index will use once it's built, so if this doesn't work
    you won't be able to use the index anyway. However, if you've got sufficient memory
    to begin with, this option will just slow down the index build by doing extra,
    useless IO.
