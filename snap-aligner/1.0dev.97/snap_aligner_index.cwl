  doc: "<chars>         Specify characters to use as chromosome name terminators in\
    \ the FASTA header line; these characters and anything after are\nnot part of\
    \ the chromosome name.  You must specify all characters on a single -B switch.\
    \  So, for example, with -B_|,\nthe FASTA header line '>chr1|Chromosome 1' would\
    \ generate a chromosome named 'chr1'.  There's a separate flag for\nindicating\

    \ but also to allow some space for representing seeds that occur multiple times.\
    \  For the\nhuman genome, it will fit with four byte locations if the seed size\
    \ is 19 or larger, but needs 5 (or more) for smaller\nseeds.  Making the location\
    \ size bigger than necessary will just waste (lots of) space, so unless you're\

    \ use less memory than the index will use once it's built, so if this doesn't\
    \ work you\nwon't be able to use the index anyway. However, if you've got sufficient\
    \ memory to begin with, this option will just\nslow down the index build by doing\
