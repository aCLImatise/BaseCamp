  It is significantly faster to process multiple gene sets in the same\"run, as 95%\
  \ of the CPU time is spent reading the MAF\n\nArguments:\n  o targetDb - db of target\
  \ genome\n  o maf - input MAF file\n  o mafFrames - output file\n  o geneDb1 - db\
  \ in MAF that corresponds to genePred's organism.\n  o genePred1 - genePred file.\

  \ include frame annotations\nOptions:\n  -bed=file - output a bed of for each mafFrame\
