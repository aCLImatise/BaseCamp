help_text: "Usage: ITSx -i <input file> -o <output file>\nOptions:\n-i {file} : DNA\
  \ FASTA input file to investigate\n-o {file} : Base for the names of output file(s)\n\
  -p {directory} : A path to a directory of HMM-profile collections representing ITS\
  \ conserved regions, default is in the same directory as ITSx itself\n--stdin {T\
  \ or F} : Use input from standard input instead of an input file, off (F) by default\n\
  --date {T or F} : Adds a date and time stamp to the output directory, off (F) by\
  \ default\n--reset {T or F} : Re-creates the HMM-database before ITSx is run, off\
  \ (F) by default\n\nSequence selection options:\n-t {character code} : Profile set\
  \ to use for the search, see the User's Guide (comma-separated), default is all\n\
  -E {value} : Domain E-value cutoff for a sequence to be included in the output,\
  \ default = 1e-5\n-S {value} : Domain score cutoff for a sequence to be included\
  \ in the output, default = 0\n-N {value} : The minimal number of domains that must\
  \ match a sequence before it is included, default = 2\n--selection_priority {score,\
  \ sum, domains, eval} : Selects what will be of highest priority when determining\
  \ the origin of the sequence, default is score\n--search_eval {value} : The E-value\
  \ cutoff used in the HMMER search, high numbers may slow down the process, cannot\
  \ be used with the --search_score option, default is 0.01\n--search_score {value}\
  \ : The score cutoff used in the HMMER search, low numbers may slow down the process,\
  \ cannot be used with the --search_eval option, default is to used E-value cutoff,\
  \ not score\n--allow_single_domain {e-value,score or F} : Allow inclusion of sequences\
  \ that only find a single domain, given that they meet the given E-value and score\
  \ thresholds, on with parameters 1e-9,0 by default\n--allow_reorder {T or F} : Allows\
  \ profiles to be in the wrong order on extracted sequences, off (F) by default\n\
  --complement {T or F} : Checks both DNA strands against the database, creating reverse\
  \ complements, on (T) by default\n--cpu {value} : the number of CPU threads to use,\
  \ default is 1\n--multi_thread {T or F} : Multi-thread the HMMER-search, on (T)\
  \ if number of CPUs (--cpu option > 1), else off (F) by default\n--heuristics {T\
  \ or F} : Selects whether to use HMMER's heuristic filtering, off (F) by default\n\
  --nhmmer {T or F} : Selects whether to use nhmmer instead of hmmsearch for HMMER\
  \ searches, off (F) by default\n\nOutput options:\n--summary {T or F} : Summary\
  \ of results output, on (T) by default\n--graphical {T or F} : 'Graphical' output,\
  \ on (T) by default\n--fasta {T or F} : FASTA-format output of extracted ITS sequences,\
  \ on (T) by default\n--preserve {T or F} : Preserve sequence headers in input file\
  \ instead of printing out ITSx headers, off (F) by default\n--save_regions {SSU,ITS1,5.8S,ITS2,LSU,all,none}\
  \ : A comma separated list of regions to output separate FASTA files for, 'ITS1,ITS2'\
  \ by default\n--anchor {integer or HMM} : Saves an additional number of bases before\
  \ and after each extracted region. If set to 'HMM' all bases matching the corresponding\
  \ HMM will be output, default = 0\n--require_anchor {integer or HMM} : Requires\
  \ the complete anchor to found in order to be included in the output sequences (see\
  \ --anchor above). Cannot be used together with the --anchor option, default = 0\n\
  --only_full {T or F} : If true, output is limited to full-length regions, off (F)\
  \ by default\n--partial {integer} : Saves additional FASTA-files for full and partial\
  \ ITS sequences longer than the specified cutoff, default = 0 (off)\n--concat {T\
  \ or F} : Saves a FASTA-file with concatenated ITS sequences (with 5.8S removed),\
  \ off (F) by default\n--minlen {integer} : Minimum length the ITS regions must be\
  \ to be outputted in the concatenated file (see above), default = 0\n--positions\
  \ {T or F} : Table format output containing the positions ITS sequences were found\
  \ in, on (T) by default\n--table {T or F} : Table format output of sequences containing\
  \ probable ITS sequences, off (F) by default\n--not_found {T or F} : Saves a list\
  \ of non-found entries, on (T) by default\n--detailed_results {T or F} : Saves a\
  \ tab-separated list of all results, off (F) by default\n--truncate {T or F} : Truncates\
  \ the FASTA output to only contain the actual ITS sequences found, on (T) by default\n\
  --silent {T or F} : Supresses printing progress info to stderr, off (F) by default\n\
  --graph_scale {value} : Sets the scale of the graph output, if value is zero, a\
  \ percentage view is shown, default = 0\n--save_raw {T or F} : Saves all raw data\
  \ for searches etc. instead of removing it on finish, off (F) by default\n\n-h :\
