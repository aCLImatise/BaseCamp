  description: As it goes through your raw reads, this program keeps track of the
    read fate so you can learn what happened to a given read ID in your raw input
    data once the analysis is done. This output can become extremely large, and often
    is utterly useless to you unless you have a very specific benchmarking or debugging
    interestes, hence, it is not stored by default. You can change that behavior by
    using this flag, and ask illumina-utils to store this data on your disk.
