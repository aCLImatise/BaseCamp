  description: Minimum abundance of a unit to be included in the network. It usually
    a good idea to give some cut-off since each unit (whether it is an oligotype or
    an MED node) is going to be a part of the network (total number of reads divided
    by 10,000 might be a good start).

  description: This defines the minimum sum normalized percent for an oligotype or
    MED node in a sample to form an edge in the network. Sum normalization takes an
    oligotype or MED node, generates a vector from its percent occurence in all samples,
    then normalizes the percent abundances so the total of the vector adds up to 100%.
    The default is 1, but it might be a good idea to set it to 0 for samples with
    a lot of samples (such as more than 100 samples).
