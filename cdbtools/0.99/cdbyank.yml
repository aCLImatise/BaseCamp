  \      [-o <outfile>] [-q <char>|-Q][-F] [-R] [-P] [-x] [-w] \n      [-z <dbfasta.cdbz>\n\
  \n    <index_file> is the index file created previously with cdbfasta\n       (usually\
  \ having a \".cidx\" suffix)\n    -a <key> the sequence name (accession) for a fasta\
  \ record to be\n       retrieved; if not given, a list of accessions is expected\n\
  \       at stdin\n    -d <fasta_file> is the fasta file to pull records from; \n\
  \       if not specified, cdbyank will look in the same directory\n       where\
  \ <index_file> resides, for a file with the same name\n       but without the \"\
  .cidx\" suffix\n    -o the records found are written to file <outfile> instead of\
  \ stdout\n    -x allows retrieval of multiple records per key, if the indexed \n\
  \       database had records with the same key (non-unique keys);\n       (without\
  \ -x only one record for a given key is retrieved)\n    -i case insensitive query\
  \ (expects the <index_file> to have been \n       created with cdbfasta -i option)\n\
  \    -Q output the query key surrounded by character '%' before the\n       corresponding\
  \ record\n    -q same as -Q but use character <char> instead of '%'\n    -w enable\
  \ warnings (sent to stderr) when a key is not found\n    -F pulls only the defline\
  \ for each record (discard the sequence)\n    -P only displays the position(s) (file\
  \ offset) within the \n       database file, for the requested record(s)\n    -R\
  \ sequence range extraction: expects the input <key(s)> to have \n       the format:\
  \ '<seq_name> <start> <end>'\n       and pulls only the specified sequence range\n\
  \    -z decompress the entire file <dbfasta.cdbz>\n       (assumes it was built\
  \ using cdbfasta with '-z' option)\n    -v show version number and exit\n    \n\
  \    Index file statistics (no database file needed):\n    -n display the number\
  \ of records indexed\n    -l list all keys stored in <index_file>\n    -s display\
  \ indexing summary info\n\n Invalid argument: --help\n"
