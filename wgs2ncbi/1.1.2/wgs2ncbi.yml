help_text: "NAME\n    wgs2ncbi - prepares whole genome sequencing projects for submission\
  \ to\n    NCBI\n\nSYNOPSIS\n     Usage: wgs2ncbi [action] -conf [config file]\n\n\
  \    Typically, you will run the following sequence of commands:\n\n     $ wgs2ncbi\
  \ prepare -conf config.ini\n     $ wgs2ncbi process -conf config.ini\n     $ wgs2ncbi\
  \ convert -conf config.ini\n     $ wgs2ncbi prune -conf config.ini\n     $ wgs2ncbi\
  \ trim -conf config.ini\n     $ wgs2ncbi compress -conf config.ini\n\n    The \"\
  prepare\" and \"compress\" steps will be one time operations, but\n    \"process\"\
  , \"convert\", \"trim\" and \"prune\" may be iterative, depending on\n    the feedback\
  \ you will get from NCBI (e.g. about invalid product names,\n    unmasked adaptor\
  \ sequences, and other problematic regions).\n\nDESCRIPTION\n    \"wgs2ncbi\" is\
  \ a script that helps users prepare submissions of\n    annotated, whole genomes\
  \ to NCBI. It does this by performing a number of\n    actions that need to be taken\
  \ in sequence. Each of these actions need to\n    be invoked as a subcommand (i.e.\
  \ \"wgs2ncbi [action]\"), which will run\n    for a certain amount of time. The\
  \ actions are documented more fully in\n    the module of functions that this script\
  \ is based on. Links to the\n    respective, expanded documentation sections are\
  \ given below. Here\n    follows a brief description of the actions:\n\n  \"prepare\"\
  \n    Prepares the rest of the procedure by expanding the single genome\n    annotation\
  \ file into separate files, one for each contig. See \"prepare\"\n    in Bio::WGS2NCBI.\n\
  \n  \"process\"\n    Processes the genome by writing out feature tables and masking\
  \ contig\n    segments as needed.\n\n  \"convert\"\n    Converts the masked contigs\
  \ and feature tables into ASN.1 using tbl2asn.\n\n  \"prune\"\n    Based on a validation\
  \ file from NCBI, makes pruned versions of feature\n    tables that omit features\
  \ within regions identified by NCBI.\n\n  \"trim\"\n    Trims leading and trailing\
  \ NNNs from sequence files and feature tables.\n\n  \"compress\"\n    Packs the\
  \ ASN.1 files into a .tar.gz archive for upload to NCBI.\n\n"
