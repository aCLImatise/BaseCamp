help_text: "Usage: segtools-feature-distance [OPTIONS] SEGMENTATION ANNOTATION\n\n\
  Given a SEGMENTATION and ANNOTATION file, 1) prints the distance of each\nsegment\
  \ to the nearest feature in the ANNOTATION file (zero if the two\noverlap) and 2)\
  \ generates a histogram of these distances. Distance is the\ndifference between\
  \ the nearest bases of the segment and the feature, so if\nthere is one base pair\
  \ between them, the distance is 2. Distances can be\nstrand-corrected with respect\
  \ to stranded features by specifying --stranded.\n\nOptions:\n  --version      \
  \       show program's version number and exit\n  -h, --help            show this\
