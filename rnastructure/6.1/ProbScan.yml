help_text: "USAGE: ProbScan <input file> [options]\nAll flags are case-insensitive,\
  \ and grouping of flags is not allowed.\n\n=============================\n==== Required\
  \ Parameters ====\n=============================\n<input file>\n    The name of\
  \ a file containing a partition function or input sequence.\n\n=========================================\n\
  ==== Option Flags Without Parameters ====\n=========================================\n\
  -a -A --hairpin \n    Print probabilities for all possible hairpin loops.\n\n-b\
  \ -B --bulge \n    Print probabilities for all possible bulge loops.\n\n-d -D --DNA\
  \ \n    Specify that the sequence is DNA, and DNA parameters are to be used.\n \
  \   Default is to use RNA parameters.\n\n-h --help \n    Display the usage details\
  \ message.\n\n-i -I --internal \n    Print probabilities for all possible internal\
  \ loops.\n\n-s -S --sequence \n    Provide RNA from sequence file. Partition function\
  \ will be calculated (may\n    take a while); if you're going to query the same\
  \ sequence repeatedly, you\n    could save a lot of time by running from a partition\
  \ function save file\n    produced by the 'partition' program.\n\n-v --version \n\
  \    Display version and copyright information for this interface.\n\n======================================\n\
  ==== Option Flags With Parameters ====\n======================================\n\
  All parameters must follow their associated flag directly.\nFailure to do so may\
  \ result in aberrant program behavior.\n\n-e -E --helix \n    Print probabilities\
  \ for all possible helices with this number of base pair\n    stacks. To get single\
  \ base pair stacks, use -e 1.\n\n-m -M --multibranch \n    Provide a file with multibranch\
  \ loops. These multibranch loops'\n    probabilities will be checked.\n\n-p -P --pairs\
  \ \n    Calculate probability for a user-specified loop. The loop must be provided\n\
  \    as a set of pairs of nucleotide indices, where the nucs in the pair are\n \
  \   delimited by dashes and each pair is delimited by a comma; eg '-e 5-20'\n  \
  \  will show the probability of a hairpin loop closed by a pair between\n    nucleotides\
  \ 5 and 20, and '-e 10-120,15-70,75-110' will give the\n    probability of a three-way\
  \ junction where the exiting helices are closed by\n    pairs at 10-120, 15-70,\
  \ and 75-110.\n\n"
